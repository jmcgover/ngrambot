[{"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy speech at Youngstown State University", "text": "...It\u2019s great to be with you this afternoon.\u2028\u2028\nAnd today, we begin a conversation about how to make America safe again. \nIn the 20th century, the United States has defeated Fascism, Nazism, and Communism. \nNow, a different threat challenges our world \u2013 radical Islamic terrorism. \nThis summer, there has been an ISIS attack launched outside the war zones of the Middle East \u2013 hard to believe \u2013 every 84 hours. \nHere in America, we have seen one brutal attack after another. \n13 were murdered and 38 wounded in the assault on Ft. Hood. \nThe Boston Marathon bombing wounded and maimed 264 people, and ultimately left five dead \u2013 including two of our great police officers. \nIn Chattanooga, Tennessee, five unarmed marines \u2013 unbelievable people by the way \u2013 were shot and killed at a military recruiting center. \nLast December, 14 innocent Americans were gunned down at an office party in San Bernardino; another 22 were very gravely injured. \nIn June, 49 Americans were executed at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando; another 53 were badly injured. It was the worst mass shooting in our history, and the attack by far the worst on the LGBTQ community. \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what, we can never ever allow this to happen again. \nIn Europe \u2013 thank you \u2013 we have seen the same carnage and bloodshed inflicted upon our closest allies. \nIn January of 2015, a French satirical newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, was attacked for publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. 12 were killed, including two police officers, and 11 were wounded. \nTwo days later, four were murdered in a Jewish delicatessen. \nIn November of 2015, terrorists went on a shooting rampage in Paris that slaughtered 130 people, and wounded another 368 people \u2013 some in very, very, very bad shape today. \nFrance is suffering gravely, and the tourism industry is being massively affected in a most negative way. \nIn March of this year, terrorists detonated a bomb in Brussels airport, killing 32 and injuring 340 people. \nThis July, in the south of France, an Islamic terrorist turned his truck into an instrument of mass murder, plowing down and killing 85 men, women and children \u2013 and wounding 308 people. Terrible. Among the dead were two Americans \u2013 a Texas father and his 11-year-old son. \nA few weeks ago, in Germany, a refugee armed with an axe wounded five people in a gruesome train attack. \nOnly days ago, an ISIS killer invaded a Christian church in Normandy, France, forced an 85-year-old priest to his knees \u2013 a priest who was beloved \u2013 before cutting his throat and just unthinkable other things. \nOverseas, ISIS has carried out an absolute atrocity and one after another. Children slaughtered, girls sold into slavery, men and women burned alive. Crucifixions, beheadings and drownings. Ethnic minorities targeted for mass execution. Holy sites desecrated. Christians driven from their homes and hunted for extermination. \nOur victory in the Cold War relied on a bipartisan and international consensus. That is what we must have to defeat radical Islamic terrorism. \nBut just like we couldn\u2019t defeat communism without acknowledging that communism exists \u2013 or explaining its horrible evils \u2013 we can\u2019t defeat radical Islamic terrorism unless we do the exact same thing. \nWe have to explain that it exists and explain the difficulties. We have to have a leader that can do that and we don\u2019t have that now. \nBut this also means we have to promote the exceptional virtues of our own way of life. We have an exceptional country, an exceptional way of life, but it\u2019s being tread on by sick, sick people. \nAnd expecting that as newcomers come into our society, they will likewise have respect and do the same. \nPride in our institutions, our history and our values should be taught by parents and teachers, and impressed upon all of those who come into our society and want to join our society. \nAssimilation is not an act of hostility, but an expression of compassion. \nOur system of government, and our American culture, is the best in the world and will produce the best outcomes for all who adopt it. \nThis approach will not only make us safer, but bring us closer together as a country. \nRenewing this spirit of Americanism will help heal the divisions in our country of which there are so many. \nWe have a divider as president. We call him the Great Divider. It\u2019s the thing he does best. \nIt will do so by emphasizing what we have in common \u2013 not what pulls us apart. \nThis is my pledge to the American people: \nAs your president, I will be your single greatest champion. \nI will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. \nWe will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its many ugly forms and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people. \nOnly this way will we make America great again and safe again \u2013 for everyone. \nThank you very much. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. \nThe Ft. Hood Shooter delivered a presentation to a room full of mental health experts before the attacks in which he threw out one red flag after another. He even proclaimed that \u201cwe love death more than you love life!\u201d Not good. \nThese warnings signs were ignored because political correctness has replaced common sense in our society. \nThat is why one of my first acts as president will be to establish a Commission on Radical Islam, which will include reformist voices in the Muslim community who will hopefully work with us. \nWe want to build bridges and erase divisions. The goal of the commission will be to identify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of radical Islam, to identify the warning signs of radicalization, and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization. \nThis commission will be used to develop new protocols for local police officers, federal investigators, and immigration screeners. \nWhile I\u2019m at it, we should give a hand to our great police officers and law enforcement officials. \nWe will also keep open Guantanamo Bay and place a renewed emphasis on human intelligence. \nDrone strikes will remain part of our strategy, but we will also seek to capture high-value targets to gain needed information to dismantle their organizations. \nForeign combatants will be tried in military commissions. \nFinally, we will pursue aggressive criminal or immigration charges against anyone who lends material support to terrorism. There will be consequences for those people. There will be very serious consequences. \nSimilar to the effort to take down the mafia, this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country. \nTo accomplish a goal, you must state a mission \u2013 the support networks for radical Islam in this country will be stripped out and removed one by one, viciously if necessary. Viciously if necessary. \nImmigration officers will also have their powers restored. Those who are guests in our country that are preaching hate will be asked to return home immediately, and if they don\u2019t do it, we will return them home. \nTo make America safe again, we must work together again. \nThe size of current immigration flows are simply too large to perform adequate screening. \nWe admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year. \nBeyond that, we admit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers and visitors from the same regions. Hundreds of thousands. \nIf we don\u2019t control the numbers, we can\u2019t perform adequate screening. There is no way it can take place. \nBy contrast, my opponent wants to increase, which is unbelievable no matter who you are, no matter where you come from, wants to increase the flow of Syrian refugees by 550% over what they are now. \nThe United States Senate Subcommittee on Immigration estimates that Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan would mean roughly 620,000 refugees from all current refugee-sending nations in her first term, assuming no cuts to other refugee programs. \nSo it could get worse. This would be additional to all other non-refugee immigration. Unbelievable numbers. Unbelievable numbers. \nThe Subcommittee estimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly $400 billion when you include the costs of health care, welfare, housing, schooling, and all other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the State Department\u2019s placement figures. Think of this $400 billion. \nIn short, Hillary Clinton wants to be America\u2019s Angela Merkel. \nAnd you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany. Crime has risen to levels that no one thought would they would ever ever see. It is a catastrophe. \nWe have enough problems in our country; we don\u2019t need more. \nLastly, we will need to restore common sense to our security procedures. \nAnother common feature of the past attacks that have occurred on our soil is that warning signs were totally ignored. \nThe 9/11 hijackers had fraud all over their visa applications. Almost every one of them. It said practically in big bold letters, \u201cFRAUD\u201d, and nobody saw it. \nThe Russians warned us about the Boston bombers here on political asylum, and the attackers were even twice interviewed by the FBI. Very sad. \nThe female San Bernardino shooter, on her statements and everything that she said. She was here on a fianc\u00e9 visa, which most people had never heard of, from Saudi Arabia, and she wanted to support very openly jihad online. \nThese are the people we are taking in. \nA neighbor saw suspicious behavior. Bombs on the floor and other things. But didn\u2019t warn authorities because they said they didn\u2019t want to be accused of racial profiling. Now many are dead and many more are gravely wounded. \nThe shooter in Orlando reportedly celebrated in his classroom after 9/11. He too was interviewed by the FBI. His father, a native of Afghanistan, supported the oppressive Taliban regime and expressed anti-American views very strongly. And by the way, was just seen sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big fat smile on his face all the way through her speech. He obviously liked what she had to say. It\u2019s called weakness, it\u2019s called stupidity, and we\u2019ve had it. \nTo defeat Islamic terrorism, we must also speak out forcefully against a hateful ideology that provides the breeding ground for violence and terrorism to grow. It\u2019s a breeding ground, it\u2019s a terrible, terrible breeding ground. \nA new immigration policy is needed immediately and as well. \nThe common thread linking the major Islamic terrorist attacks that have recently occurred on our soil \u2013 9/11, the Ft. Hood shooting, the Boston bombing, the San Bernardino attack, the Orlando attack \u2013 is that they have involved immigrants or the children of immigrants. \nClearly, new screening procedures are needed. \nA review by the U.S. Senate Immigration Subcommittee has identified 380 foreign-born individuals charged with terrorism or terrorism-related offenses between 9/11 and 2014, and many more since then. \nAnd this year is a record for identification. It\u2019s gotten worse \u2013 far worse. \nWe also know that ISIS recruits refugees after their entrance into the country \u2013 as we have seen with the Somali refugee population in Minnesota. \nBeyond terrorism, as we have also seen in France, foreign populations have brought their anti-Semitic attitudes with them. \nIn Cologne, Germany on New Year\u2019s Eve, we have seen the reports of sexual violence and assault far greater than anybody knows. \nPew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants, extreme views about religion \u2013 such as the death penalty and for those who are involved, the death penalty is very, very common if you don\u2019t have the the faith that they demand you have. \nA Trump administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration, and we will be tough and we will be even extreme. \nWe should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people. \nIn the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test. \nThe time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today. I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme, extreme vetting. \nOur country has enough problems, we don\u2019t need more. These are problems like we\u2019ve never had before. \nIn addition to screening out all members or sympathizers of terrorist groups, we must also screen out any who have hostile attitudes towards our country or its principles \u2013 or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law. \nThose who do not believe in our Constitution or who support bigotry and hatred will not be admitted for immigration into our country. \nOnly those who we expect to flourish in our country \u2013 and to embrace a tolerant American society \u2013 should be issued visas. \nTo put these new procedures in place, we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism. Not for us, not for us. \nAs soon as I take office, I will ask the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to identify a list of regions where adequate screening cannot take place. There are many such regions. \nWe will stop processing visas from those areas until such time as it is deemed safe to resume based on new circumstances or new procedures. \nMy administration will aggressively pursue joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy ISIS, international cooperation to cut off their funding, expanded intelligence sharing, and cyber warfare to disrupt and disable their propaganda and recruiting. \nTheir recruiting is taking place right now and they\u2019re setting records. It\u2019s gotta be stopped. We cannot allow the Internet to be used as a recruiting tool and for other purposes by our enemy. We must shut down their access to this form of communication, and we must do it immediately. Immediately. \nUnlike Hillary Clinton, who has risked so many lives with her careless handling of sensitive information, my administration will not telegraph exactly military plans and what they are. \nBy the way, what\u2019s happened with her 33,000 emails is an absolute disgrace to the United States of America. \nI have often said that the great General Douglas MacArthur and the great General George Patton would be in a state of shock if they were alive today to see the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton try to recklessly announce their every move before it happens \u2013 like they did in Iraq \u2013 so that the enemy can prepare and adapt. Their enemy says \u201cThank you.\u201d \nThe fight will not be limited to ISIS. We will decimate Al Qaeda, and we will seek to starve funding for Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah. So important. \nWe can use existing UN Security Council resolutions to apply new and even stronger sanctions. Military, cyber, and financial warfare will all be necessary to dismantle Islamic terrorism. \nBut we must use ideological warfare as well. Very important, and they use it on us better than we have ever even thought of using it on them but that will change. \nJust as we won the Cold War, in part, by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets, so too must we take on the ideology of radical Islam. \nWhile my opponent accepted millions of dollars in foundation donations from countries where being gay is an offense punishable by prison or death, my administration will speak out against the oppression of women, gays and people of different beliefs. \nOur administration would be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East and will amplify their voices. \nThis includes speaking out against the horrible practice of honor killings, where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing, marrying or acting in a way that violates fundamentalist teachings. \nOver 1,000 Pakistani girls are estimated to be the victims of honor killings by their relatives each year. \nRecently, a prominent Pakistani social media star was strangled to death by her brother on the charge of dishonoring the family. In his confession, the brother took pride in the murder and said: \u201cGirls are born to stay home and follow traditions.\u201d \nShockingly, this is a practice that has reached our own shores. \nOne such cases, and many, many cases have happened, the one involves an Iraqi immigrant who was sentenced to 34 years in jail for running over his own daughter claiming she had been \u201ctoo Westernized.\u201d \nAccording to CNN, ISIS made as much as $500 million in oil sales in 2014 alone. That\u2019s before they really got started, fueling and funding its reign of terror. \nIf we had controlled the oil, like I said we should, we could have prevented the rise of ISIS in Iraq \u2013 both by cutting off a major source of funding and through the presence of U.S. forces necessary to safeguard the oil and vital infrastructure products necessary for us to have the oil. \nI was saying this constantly and consistently to whoever would listen. I said \u201cKeep the oil, keep the oil, keep the oil. Don\u2019t let somebody else get it.\u201d \nIf they had listened to me then, we would have had the economic benefits of the oil, which I wanted to use to help take care of the wounded soldiers and families of those who died in the war in addition to which thousands of lives would have been saved. \nThis proposal, by its very nature, would have left soldiers in place of our assets. We would have had soldiers there guarding this valuable supply of oil. \nIn the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils. Instead, all we got from Iraq \u2013 and our adventures in the Middle East \u2013 was death, destruction and tremendous financial loss. But it\u2019s time to put the mistakes of the past behind us, and chart a new course. \nIf I become president, the era of nation-building will be brought to a very swift and decisive end. \nOur new approach, which must be shared by both parties in America, by our allies overseas, and by our friends in the Middle East, must be to halt the spread of radical Islam. \nAll actions should be oriented around this goal, and any country which shares this goal will be our ally. Very important. \nSome don\u2019t share this goal. We cannot always choose our friends, but we can never fail to recognize our enemies. \nAs president, I will call for an international conference focused on this goal. We will work side-by-side with our friends in the Middle East, including our greatest ally, Israel. We will partner with King Abdullah of Jordan, and President of Egypt, President Sisi, and all others who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished. \nWe will also work closely with NATO on this new mission. I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism; since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats. Very good. Very, very good. \nI also believe that we could find common ground with Russia in the fight against ISIS. Wouldn\u2019t that be a good thing? Wouldn\u2019t that be a good thing? They too have much at stake in the outcome in Syria and have had their own battles with Islamic terrorism just as bad as ours. They have a big, big problem in Russia with ISIS. \nIt is now time for a new approach. Our current strategy of nation-building and regime change is a proven absolute failure. We have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive. \nI was an opponent of the Iraq war from the beginning \u2013 a major difference between me and my opponent. \nThough I was a private citizen, whose personal opinions on such matters were really not sought, I nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion. \nI was against, believe me. \nThree months before the invasion I said, in an interview with Neil Cavuto, to whom I offer my best wishes for a speedy recovery, that \u201cperhaps we shouldn\u2019t be doing it yet\u201d and that \u201cthe economy is a much bigger problem.\u201d \nIn August of 2004, very early right after the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire magazine in an interview. \nHere is the quote in full: \n\u201cLook at the war in Iraq and the mess we\u2019re in. I would never have handled it that way.\u201d \nThis was right after the invasion. \n\u201cDoes anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to go and step up and lead the country? C\u2019mon.\u201d \nI then continued,\u201dTwo minutes after we leave, there\u2019s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy, in this case guy, will take over. And he\u2019ll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam Hussein did not have.\u201d \n\u201cWhat was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention, in all fairness, the other side \u2013 the tremendous damage done. All those Iraqi kids who\u2019ve been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All of this death and destruction for nothing.\u201d \nSo I have been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in. \nBut I have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out. \nAfter we had made those hard-fought sacrifices and gains, we should have never made such a sudden withdrawal \u2013 on a timetable advertised to our enemies. They said we\u2019re moving out. Here\u2019s our time. Here\u2019s our date. Who would do this but an incompetent president? \nAl Qaeda in Iraq had been decimated, and Obama and Clinton gave it new life and allowed it to spread all across the world. \nBy that same token, President Obama and Hillary Clinton should never have attempted to build a democracy in Libya, to push for immediate regime change in Syria, or to support the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt. \nOne more point on this: I have long said that we should have kept the oil in Iraq. I said it over and over and over again \u2013 another area where my judgment has been proven correct. I just said it so many times, virtually every time I was interviewed. \u201cKeep the oil, keep the oil.\u201d \u00a0 \nIn short, the Obama-Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East, and put the nation of Iran \u2013 which chants \u201cDeath to America\u201d \u2013 in a dominant position of regional power and, in fact, aspiring to be a dominant world power. \nIt all began in 2009 with what has become known as President Obama\u2019s global \u201cApology Tour\u201d. We all remember. We all remember. \nIn a series of speeches, President Obama described America as \u201carrogant, dismissive, derisive\u201d and a \u201ccolonial power.\u201d He was describing us. \nHe informed other countries that he would be speaking up about America\u2019s \u201cpast errors.\u201d \nHe pledged that we would no longer be a \u201csenior partner\u201d that \u201csought to dictate our terms.\u201d \nHe lectured CIA officers of the need to acknowledge their mistakes and described Guantanamo Bay as a \u201crallying cry for our enemies.\u201d \nPerhaps no speech was more misguided than President Obama\u2019s speech to the Muslim world delivered in Cairo, Egypt, 2009. I remember it well. \nIn winning the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan repeatedly touted the superiority of freedom over communism, and called the USSR the \u201cEvil Empire\u201d. \nYet, when President Obama delivered his address in Cairo, no such moral courage could be found or would be found. \nInstead of condemning the oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations, and the systematic violations of human rights, or the financing of global terrorism, President Obama tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights record \u2013 and remember this \u2013 our human rights and theirs. The records are unbelievable and unmistakable. \nHis na\u00efve words were followed by even more na\u00efve actions. \nThe failure to establish a new Status of Forces Agreement in Iraq and the election-driven timetable for withdrawal surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of ISIS \u2013 without question. \nThe failures in Iraq were compounded by Hillary Clinton\u2019s disaster \u2013 total disaster \u2013 in Libya. \nPresident Obama has since said he regrets and really regrets Libya and the mistake he made. He considers it his worst mistake. \nAccording to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the invasion of Libya was nearly a split decision, but Hillary Clinton\u2019s forceful advocacy for the intervention was the deciding factor. That\u2019s why we went in. \nWith one episode of bad judgment after another, Hillary Clinton\u2019s policies launched ISIS onto the world stage. \nYet, as she threw the Middle East into violent turmoil, things turned out really to be not so hot for our world and our country, the Middle East in particular. \nThe Clintons made almost $60 million in gross income while she was Secretary of State. It is unbelievable. \nIncident after incident proves again and again Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment, as said by Bernie Sanders, stability and temperament, and the moral character to lead our nation. \nImportantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS, and all of the many adversaries we face \u2013 not only in terrorism, but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn our great country around. \nISIS rounding-up what it calls the \u201cnation of the cross\u201d \u2013 nation of the cross \u2013 in a campaign of absolute and total genocide. \nWe cannot let this evil continue. \nNor can we let the hateful ideology of radical Islam \u2013 its oppression of women, gays, children, and non-believers \u2013 be allowed to reside or spread within our own countries. \nWe will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, just as we have defeated every threat we have faced at every age and before. \nBut we will not, remember this, we will not defeat it with closed eyes, or silenced voices. We have a president that doesn\u2019t want to say the words. \nAnyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead our country. \nAnyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president. \nThe rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton. \nLet\u2019s look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009, before the Obama-Clinton administration took over. \nLibya was stable. Syria was under control. Egypt was ruled by a secular president and an ally of the United States. Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished. Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions. \nFast-forward to today. \nWhat we have \u2013 and think of this \u2013 and the decisions made by Obama-Clinton group have been absolutely disastrous. \nLibya is in ruins. Our ambassador and three other really brave Americans are dead, and ISIS has gained a new base of operations. \nSyria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. \nA refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States. \nIn Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert, near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways in the world. \nIraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose. \nISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the West. \nIn 2014, ISIS was operating in seven nations. They were in seven nations. Terrible, but that\u2019s what it was. \nToday, they are fully operational in 18 countries with aspiring branches in six more, for a total of 24 \u2013 and many believe that number is actually 28 to 30 countries. They don\u2019t even know. \nThe situation is likely worse than the public has any idea. \nA new Congressional report reveals that the administration has downplayed the growth of ISIS, with 40% of analysts saying they had experienced efforts to manipulate their findings. \nThey are trying to make it look much better than it is. It\u2019s bad. \nAt the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and to the United States. \nIran, the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with $150 billion in cash released by the United States \u2013 plus, if you remember from two weeks ago, another $400 million in actual cash that was obviously used for ransom. \nWorst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech on the Orlando terrorist attack", "text": "We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates. We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status. We have to know and we have to know fast. \nWe need to know if he traveled anywhere and who he traveled with. We need to know and we need to make sure every single last person involved in his plan, including anyone who knew something but didn\u2019t tell us, is brought to justice so when people know what\u2019s going on and they don\u2019t tell us and we have an attack and people die, these people have to have consequences. Big consequences. \nAmerica must do more, much more to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientation. \n...It also means we must change our foreign policy. \nThe decision to overthrow the regime in Libya then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria among other things without plans for the day after have created space for ISIS to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before. \nThese actions along with our disastrous Iran deal have reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region. \nThat is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building. No more nation-building. It\u2019s never going to work. \nAnd by the way, we\u2019ve spent $5 trillion over the years on trying to nation-build in the Middle East and it has been a complete and total disaster. We\u2019re further away now than we were 15 years ago. \nFor instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton\u2019s war in Libya. That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent. \nI\u2019ve said NATO needs to change its focus and stop terrorism. We have to focus on terrorism and we have to stop terrorism. \nSince I\u2019ve raised that criticism and it\u2019s okay I\u2019ve gotten no credit for it but these are minor details, NATO has since announced a new initiative \u2013 front page of the Wall Street Journal four days ago \u2013 focused on just that. \nAmerica must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism. Pretty much like we did with communism during the Cold War. \nWe\u2019ve tried it President Obama\u2019s way. Doesn\u2019t work. He gave the world his apology tour. We got ISIS, and many other problems in return. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got. Remember the famous apology tour? \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for everything.\u201d \nI\u2019d like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under this horrific attack. \nWhen I\u2019m president, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside our borders. \nWherever they come from, wherever they were born, I don\u2019t care. All Americans living here and following our laws, not other laws, will be protected. \nThank you. \nAsk yourselves, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community? \nDonald Trump with actions or Hillary Clinton with her words? I will tell you who the better friend is and someday I believe that will be proven out big league. \nAnd by the way, the LBGT community is just \u2013 what\u2019s happened to them is just so sad and to be thinking about where their policies are with this current administration is a disgrace to that community. I will tell you right now. \nClinton wants to allow radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country. They enslave women and they murder gays. I don\u2019t want them in our country. \nImmigration is a privilege and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn\u2019t support our communities \u2013 all of our communities \u2013 every single one of them. \nAmerica\u2019s already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on Earth. Anybody in the world \u2013 four times more at least because we don\u2019t even know who\u2019s coming in. And we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny. \nNot surprisingly, wages for our workers haven\u2019t budged in almost 20 years. \nYou wonder why we get the crowds. You wonder why we get this tremendous support? You wonder why I\u2019ve gotten more votes any Republican in any primary in the history of the Republican Party? \nTake a look at that. Take a look at your security but take a look at your wages. For 18 years, they\u2019ve been stagnant. They\u2019ve even gone down. \nSo whether it\u2019s a matter of national security or financial security, we can\u2019t afford to keep on going like this. Cannot afford it. \nWe owe $19 trillion in debt and no longer have any options. Our communities from all backgrounds are ready for some relief. \nThis is not an act of offense against anyone. It\u2019s really an act of defense. \nI want us all \u2013 all of us \u2013 to work together. We have to form a partnership with our Muslim communities. We have Muslim communities in this country that are great and we have to form that partnership. \nNow, the Muslim community so importantly, they have to work with us. They have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad and they know it and they have to do it and they have to do it forthwith. \nI want to fix our schools. I want to fix our bridges and our jobs market \u2013 we\u2019re going to have it rocking again. We\u2019re going to make great trade deals. \nBut I want every American to succeed, including Muslims. But the Muslims have to work with us. They have to work with us. They know what\u2019s going on. They know that he was bad. They knew the people in San Bernardino were bad. But you know what? They didn\u2019t turn them in, and we had death and destruction. \nHillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate to protect our citizens. \nI want to protect our citizens \u2013 all of our citizens. \nThe terrorist attack on Pulse Nightclub demands a full and complete investigation into every single aspect of the assault. \nIn San Bernardino, as an example, people who know what was going on. They knew exactly. But they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting him. They said, \u201cOh, we thought so but we didn\u2019t want to use racial profiling.\u201d Which is probably an excuse given to them by their lawyer so they don\u2019t get in trouble. \nThis could be a better, bigger, more horrible version than the legendary Trojan Horse ever was. \nAltogether, under the Clinton plan, you\u2019d be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them or to prevent the radicalization of the children and their children. Not only their children, by the way, they\u2019re trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is and how wonderful Islam is and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. \nThe burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to really just screen. We\u2019re not screening people. \nSo why don\u2019t we have an effective screening system? We don\u2019t. We\u2019re being laughed at all over the world. \nThe burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans. \nThe burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it. Her plan will cost hundreds of billions of dollars long-term. \nWouldn\u2019t this be money better spent rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here. We have cities. We have inner cities. We have poverty all over, and this is how we\u2019re spending billions of dollars? \nWe have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States. We don\u2019t know who they are. They have no documentation. And we don\u2019t know what they\u2019re planning, and we won\u2019t unless we have proper supervision and proper leadership, in which case they\u2019re out of here. \nWhat I want is common sense. I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values. That\u2019s a choice I put before the American people -a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America or Hillary Clinton\u2019s radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interests. That\u2019s all it is. \nWe\u2019ve got to get smart and tough and vigilant, and we\u2019ve got to do it now because later is too late \u2013 going to be too late for our country. \nThe media talks about homegrown terrorism. But Islamic radicalism \u2013 and that\u2019s a very, very important term, a term that the president refuses to use \u2013 and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas, whether you like or whether you don\u2019t like it. \nYes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of poor policies of our past. \nBut the whole point is that we will be much, much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we don\u2019t keep on bringing people who add to the problem, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. We\u2019re letting all these people \u2013 hundreds of thousands of people \u2013 and all they\u2019re doing is adding to this incredible problem we have. \nFor instance, the controversial mosque attended by the Boston bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot. \nThis shooter and amazingly in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. \nWhy would we admit people who support violent hatred? \nHillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country and who suppress women, gays, and anyone else who doesn\u2019t share their views or values. \nShe can\u2019t have it both ways. She can\u2019t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who wants to oppress these same communities. \nHow does this kind of immigration make our lives better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better? \nWhy does Hillary Clinton want to bring people in in vast numbers who reject our values? Why? Explain? \nWe don\u2019t have the support. We don\u2019t have the support of the law enforcement system because Obama is not letting them do their jobs. They are not being allowed to do their jobs and they can do it well, better than anybody. \nWe need a new leader. We need a new leader fast. \nThey have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else. \nI refuse to be politically correct. I want to do the right thing. I want to straighten things out. And I want to make America great again. \nThe days of deadly ignorance will end and they will end soon if I\u2019m elected. \nAs president, I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement, and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks. They don\u2019t have those tools now. \nWe need an intelligence gathering system second to none \u2013 second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local, and federal officials and with our allies. Very importantly. \nI will have an attorney general, a director of national intelligence, and a secretary of defense who will know how to fight the war on radical Islamic terrorism. And they will have the support that they need to get the job done right, not like it is right now. It\u2019s not right. \nWe also must ensure that the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat. \nThe Senate Committee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since Sept. 11th. \nNearly a year ago, the Senate subcommittee asked President Obama\u2019s Department of Justice...and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States. These departments refused to comply. Nobody even knows why they\u2019ve refused to comply. \nPresident Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activities of any kind since Sept. 11th. So important. \nThe public has a right to know how these people got here, how they came on to this great land. Why are they here? \nWe have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with or supporting radical groups and beliefs. \nVery simple. We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country, and we have to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America. Not complicated. \nAnd just think of this \u2013 take a look \u2013 every single event even a single individual can be devastating and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in Orlando and what happened in other cases. Just a single event. And just one person. Can you imagine what they\u2019ll do in large groups which we\u2019re allowing now to come here? \nTruly our president doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s failed and he\u2019s failed us badly. And under his leadership, this situation will not get any better; it will only get worse and I\u2019ve been saying that for a long time. \nEach year, the United States permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East and many more from Muslim countries outside of the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever growing numbers year after year without any effective plan for our own security. \nIn fact, Clinton\u2019s State Department was in charge of admissions and the admission process for people applying to enter from overseas. Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country. \nTell me, tell me how stupid is that? \nThe male shooter in San Bernardino, again whose name I will not mention, was the child of immigrants from Pakistan and he brought his wife, the other terrorist, from Saudi Arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs. \nImmigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five fold \u2013 five fold \u2013 in just one year. \nAccording to Pew Research, 99% of the people in Afghanistan support oppressive sharia law. We admit many more and that\u2019s just the way it is. We admit many more from other countries in the region. And I\u2019ll tell you what, they share these oppressive views and values. \nWe want to remain a free and open society. Then and if we do, then we have to control our borders. We have to control and we have to control them now, not later. Right now. \nYet, Hillary Clinton for months and despite so many attacks repeatedly refused to even say the words radical Islam until I challenged her yesterday. \nAnd guess what? She will probably say them. She sort have said them. But let\u2019s see what happens. She really has no choice. But she doesn\u2019t want. \nHowever, she\u2019s really been forced and she has been forced to say these words. She supports \u2013 and the reason is she supports so much of what is wrong and what is wrong in this country and what\u2019s going wrong with our country and our borders. \nShe has no clue in my opinion what radical Islam is and she won\u2019t speak honestly about it if she does in fact know. \nShe\u2019s in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcast weakness across the entire world. True weakness. \nI don\u2019t know if you know this but just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter \u2013 that\u2019s all it was, a slaughter \u2013 Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words radical Islam. \nHere is what she said \u2013 exact quote \u2013 \u201cMuslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.\u201d That is Hillary Clinton. \nSo she says the solution is to ban guns. \nThey tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, and 130 people were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. \nHer plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the Second Amendment and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. No good. Not going to happen, folks, not going to happen. Not going to happen. \nShe wants to take away Americans\u2019 guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter. Let them come into the country. We don\u2019t have guns. Let them come in. Let them have all the fun they want. \nI will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror. \nI will be always defending the Second Amendment. Thank you. Thank you. \nThe bottom line is that Hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical Islam into America and allow it to grow overseas and it is growing. \nIn fact, Hillary Clinton\u2019s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical Islamic immigration into this country threatening not only our society but our entire way of life. \nWhen it comes to radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss. It\u2019s deadly. Totally deadly. \nThe Obama administration with the support of Hillary Clinton and others has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence gathering and we have just no intelligence gathering information. We need this information so badly and he stopped it.\n... \nWe have an incompetent administration, and if I\u2019m elected president, that will not change. I will tell you, that will not change over the next four years. We have an administration that will not change. \nBut if I get in there, it\u2019s going to change and it\u2019s going to change quickly. We\u2019re going from totally incompetent to just the opposite. Believe me. \nWith 50 people dead and perhaps more ultimately and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around issues anymore. We have to address these issues head-on. \nI called for a ban after San Bernardino and was met with great scorn and anger. But now, many years, and I have to say \u2013 many are saying that I was right to do so. And although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. We have to do it. \nIt will be lifted this ban when and as a nation we\u2019re in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country. They\u2019re pouring in and we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. \nThe immigration laws of the United States give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons. \nNow, any class \u2013 it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interest of the United States and it\u2019s as he or she deems appropriate. Hopefully, it\u2019s he in this case. Thank you. \nI will use this power to protect the American people. \nWhen I\u2019m elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there\u2019s a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe, or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats. \nAfter a full \u2013 thank you, and by the way, we have no choice. After a full, impartial, and long \u2013 really long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America. \nWe cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as the savage killer. \nMany of the principles of radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions. \nRemember this, radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay, and anti-American. \nI refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, Jewish people are targets of persecution and intimidation by radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence. \nThis is not just a national security issue; it\u2019s a quality of life issue. \nIf we want to protect quality of life for all Americans, women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians, and all people, then we need to tell the truth about radical Islam and we need to do it now. \nWe need to tell the truth also about how radical Islam is coming to our shores and it\u2019s coming. With these people, folks, it\u2019s coming. \nWe\u2019re importing radical Islamic terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president. \nEven our own FBI director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of people we\u2019re letting into America. \nAll of the Sept. 11th hijackers were issued visas. Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS. The Boston bombers came here through political asylum. \nThis was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and all of the bad things \u2013 and we all know what\u2019s going on \u2013 and especially how poor she\u2019d do as president in these very, very troubled times of radical Islamic terrorism. \nEven her former Secret Service agent who\u2019s seen her under pressure and in times of stress has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be our president. \nThere will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time and I will deliver that speech very, very soon. \nBut today there is only one thing to discuss \u2013 the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders. \nThe attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since Sept. 11th and the worst mass shooting in our country\u2019s history. \nSo many people \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s just hard to believe. Just so many people dead. So many people gravely injured. So much carnage. Such a disgrace. \nThe horror is beyond description. The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated and they will be forever. \nLikewise, our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated. \nWe express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families. \nWe mourn as one people for our nation\u2019s loss and pledge our support to any and all who need it. \nI would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of this attack. Thank you. \nOur nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando\u2019s LGBT community. They have been through something that nobody could ever experience. \nThis is a very dark moment in America\u2019s history. A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because she wanted to kill Americans but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation. \nIt\u2019s a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation. \nIt\u2019s an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want, and express their identity. It\u2019s an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country. \nWe need to respond to this attack in America as one united people with force, purpose and determination. \nBut the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly. We\u2019re not acting clearly. We\u2019re not talking clearly. We\u2019ve got problems. \nIf we don\u2019t get tough and if we don\u2019t get smart and fast, we\u2019re not going to have our country anymore. There will be nothing \u2013 absolutely nothing left. \nThe killer, whose name I will not use or ever say, was born in Afghan of Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States. \nHis father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime who murders those who don\u2019t share its radical views and they murdered plenty. \nThe father even said he was running for president of Afghanistan. \nThe bottom line is the only reason the killer was in America in the first place is because we allowed his family to come here. That is a fact and it\u2019s a fact we need to talk about. \nWe have a dysfunctional immigration system, which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens properly.

You were for a single-payer system \u2013 a Canadian-style system. Why were you for that then and why aren\u2019t you for it now? \nAs far as single-payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you\u2019re talking about here. \nWhat I\u2019d like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state. \nI have a big company with thousands and thousands of employees, and if I\u2019m negotiating in New York or New Jersey or in California, I have like one bidder. Nobody can bid. You know why? Because the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians. \nOf course, with the exception of the politicians of this stage. \nBut they have total control of the politicians. They\u2019re making a fortune. \nGet rid of these artificial lines and you will have yourself great plans. \nAnd then we have to take care of the people that can\u2019t take care of themselves, and I will do that through a different system. \nSen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky):\nNews flash. New flash. The Republican Party has been fighting against the single payer system for a decade. \nSo I think you\u2019re on the wrong side of this if you\u2019re still arguing for a single payer system. \nQuestion:\n...It\u2019s not just your past support for single-payer health care. You\u2019ve also supported a whole host of other liberal policies. You\u2019ve also donated to several Democratic candidates \u2013 Hillary Clinton included, Nancy Pelosi. \nYou\u2019ve explained away those donations saying that you did that to get business-related favors. \nAnd you said recently when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do. \nQuestion:\nSo what specifically did they do? \nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida):\nNot me. \nGov. Mike Huckabee (R-Arkansas):\nBut you\u2019re welcome to give me a check, Donald, if you\u2019d like. \nAnd you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me. \nThat\u2019s a broken system. \nQuestion:\nSo what\u2019d you get from Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi? \nI gave to her foundation that frankly that foundation is supposed to do good. I didn\u2019t know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world. It was. \nGov. Scott Walker (R-Wisconsin):\n...We spend a lot of time talking about Hillary Clinton and pitting us back and forth. Let\u2019s be clear. We should be talking about Hillary Clinton on that last subject because everywhere in the world that Hillary Clinton touched is more messed up today than before she \u2013 [overlapping audio]\n "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s energy policy speech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "text": "...We\u2019ll fundamentally change the economic landscape of this region and our country, bringing extraordinary new prosperity to millions \u2013 more jobs, higher wages, a larger tax base, and dollars flowing into our country for a change, instead of out of our country, which is typical. \nHillary Clinton\u2019s war on energy will cost our economy $5 trillion at least. \nShe\u2019s not only declared war on the miners, but on all oil and natural gas production. It\u2019s war. Which supports 10 million jobs in the United States. And you people know it\u2019s war. It\u2019s going to be worse under her than it\u2019s been under President Obama. \nAccess to low-cost liquid natural gas also supports the American chemical industry, which supports 40,000 jobs in the state of Pennsylvania. \nWe have just begun, as a nation, to recognize our economic advantage, that is made possible by shale energy. \nThe shale energy revolution will unleash massive wealth for American workers and their families. \nAt the same time, this energy revolution will produce new demand for American steel, and that means the steel workers will benefit. \nAnd the steel workers today are having a very, very hard time. That business is going down on a yearly basis. \nWe are going to benefit the steel workers and the steel business. \nBut federal restrictions remain a major impediment to both shale production specifically and energy production in general. \nCurrently less than 10% of the federally managed surface and mineral estates are leased for oil and gas development. Almost 90% of our nation\u2019s offshore acreage is off limits to energy production. In many cases, there is absolutely no reason for that. \nOur energy policy will make full use of our domestic energy sources, including traditional and renewable energy sources. We want everything. \nThat means we will end the war on coal and the war on our miners. I will rescind the coal-mining lease moratorium, which is a horrible moratorium and so unfair. The excessive Interior Department stream rule and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama administration. \nWe will eliminate the highly invasive Waters of the U.S. rule and scrap the $5 trillion  Obama-Clinton Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan. These unilateral plans will increase monthly electric bills by double-digits without any measurable improvement in climate, whatsoever. Very unfair to our people and our workers. \nI will re-focus the EPA on its core mission of ensuring clean air and clean, safe drinking water for all Americans. That\u2019s what we want. \nI believe firmly in conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats. \nMy environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas that are putting our country behind the eight ball. \nIt will be a future of conservation, of prosperity, and of great success for the people in this room, and for all of those people that you employ, the tens of thousands of great people that you employ. \nIt will be a future of new technology, new innovation, and new solutions. \nIt will be a future we can achieve together, beginning with a victory on Nov. 8th. Get out and vote. \nWe will make American wealthy again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. \nThank you very much. \nPerhaps the most pro-growth economic plan anywhere in American history. I think it is. \nCompare that to my opponent. She plans a $1.3 trillion tax hike, massive new regulations, and some of your industries sitting right in this room are out of business. The offshoring of American jobs and the aggressive restriction of American energy production. \nHer plan will help only her wealthy donors and global special interests who benefit from the rigged system. And we are in a rigged system. \nHillary Clinton wants to put the coal miners out of work, ban hydraulic fracking in almost all places, and extensively restrict and ban energy production on public land and in most offshore areas. That\u2019s what she said. \nRemember she said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to put the miners out of work\u201d? \nThis will produce devastation for states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and so many others where shale oil and shale energy and coal and coal production are critical parts of the economy. \nI go to the coal areas and it\u2019s like devastation. And these are amazing people. Unbelievable people. \nHer plan hurts states like Colorado, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and anywhere with access to either onshore or offshore energy resources. \nShe also supports blocking the energy infrastructure that\u2019s needed to move our energy resources to the market place. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, overall more than a dozen fossil fuel projects, worth about $33 billion, have been either rejected by regulators or withdrawn by developers since 2012 only with billions more tied in projects still in regulatory limbo. They won\u2019t happen either. \nNow, if I\u2019m president, they\u2019ll happen quickly. I will tell you that. Happen very quickly. You\u2019ll be amazing at how quickly they\u2019ll happen. \nExamples of energy transportation projects blocked or abandoned include an $850-million coal export facility in Washington, a $3 billion natural gas pipeline in the Northeast, and a $6.8-billion liquid natural gas export facility among others. Many others. \nBillions of dollars in private infrastructure investment have been lost to the Obama-Clinton restriction agenda, and many many, many billions more to follow. \nThe platform produced by Hillary Clinton\u2019s party this year also calls for a price on carbon. That\u2019s just political speak for a massive new tax on coal and shale production \u2013 a tax on American consumers. And it\u2019s very unfair to our country and it makes it very unfair and very uncompetitive to do business with other countries. Very. It makes it so tough to compete with other countries. \nAnd remember every energy dollar that isn\u2019t harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country \u2013 often foreign countries not very friendly to us. \nThat not only means, so true, that we\u2019re sending our jobs to those countries but it means that energy is being produced in foreign countries that lack our high environmental and conservation standards, which we want to keep. \nThat is just one more reason why we should pursue the safe and responsible production of America\u2019s vast energy resources and reserves. \nWe need an American first energy plan. It\u2019s going to be from now on America First. \nThis means opening federal lands for oil and gas production, opening offshore areas, and revoking policies that are imposing unnecessary restrictions on innovative new exploration technologies. The development of the Marcellus and Utica shale, that I know so well. I\u2019m up in New York State. What a shame. What a shame... \nBillions and billions held up. Creating countless more jobs for our country in the process. \nOverall my entire economic plan \u2013 tax reform, regulatory reform, energy reform, and trade reform will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years assuming an average growth rate of 3.5%. \nAnd I believe we can reach beyond actually 4% growth. Why not? \nAnd just so you know, when China does 7% or even 8%, it\u2019s a major panic in the country. They then start devaluing of course and they get their numbers up, much to our chagrin. \nMy tax plan includes a 15% business rate, think of that, so that we\u2019re reducing taxes from 35% all the way down for business to 15%, turning America into a jobs magnet. \nHillary Clinton would raise taxes on some small businesses as high as 45% and probably even higher than that. And as far as regulations are concerned it will be beyond anything you\u2019re experiencing right now. \nSo you better get everybody out to vote, folks, or you can sort of forget it, and all these jobs that we\u2019re talking about will go in the opposite direction. \nIncome taxes will be simplified from seven brackets to three, and middle class Americans will get a major tax cut including child care deductions and tax-free child care savings accounts. \nMy plan includes the elimination of all unnecessary regulations and a temporary moratorium on new regulations not compelled by Congress or public safety. \nOver-regulation is costing our economy $2 trillion a year. And I think probably no other business has been affected than your business by over-regulation. \nAnd one of the things I\u2019ve seen, despite this massive tax cut, the biggest since Ronald Reagan and maybe beyond that, from 35% to 15%, people are more excited when I talk about the fact that we\u2019re going to be cutting massively regulations. \nWe need regulations for safety and environment but regulations are becoming a major industry right now. We\u2019re going to make it a much smaller industry, maybe a minor industry. \nYour regulations are going to be cut back to a point that you\u2019ll be able to have your businesses, grow your businesses, and start new businesses, and you\u2019ll never be able to do that with what has taken place over the last eight years. I just think it\u2019s a really important thing. \nWhat has really impressed me is people in business have actually felt more strongly about that than the tax cut itself. So I understand that very well. \nOn energy, my economic plan unlocks our shale oil and gas and the energy technologies of both today and tomorrow. \nFinally, my plan includes a re-negotiation of America\u2019s trade deals and an enforcement of trade rules to increase jobs and wealth inside the U.S. We have people right in this room that could do so well for us. \nWe have negotiators of our trade deals who are political hacks, who are people that don\u2019t know the first thing about negotiation. Of course, you could just look at the Iran deal and you\u2019ll understand that. The deal that was just made recently with Iran. What a deal that is. \nI mean, we have half of this room could have negotiated a deal 10 times better, and a lot of the room just wouldn\u2019t have made a deal and that would have been a lot better. \nBut they did something that you folks...never saw before. We thought it was $400 million in cash. Cash. Not like a check. $400 million in cash. It was $1.7 billion in cash. And even you. You\u2019ve never seen 1.7 in cash, right? We\u2019re taking about cash Harold. Man. \nThat\u2019ll take an airplane \u2013 I don\u2019t even see how an airplane, even a big one, is big enough for that. I would like to see that someday. $1.7 billion in cash. But it had nothing to do with the hostages, right? \nStrong border controls will also protect our workers and save our budget trillions in the long term. \nWe all remember earlier this year when officers in Dallas, hunted down for execution, continued protecting the public until their last moments on Earth. They were killed. \nEvery day, police officers risk their lives for really complete strangers. And in every year, many of them will go out on calls and never return. It\u2019s tough being a police officer. And it\u2019s hard now even recruiting police officers. It\u2019s a tremendous problem. \nPolice are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything that we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and any wrongdoing is always \u2013 and it will be by them \u2013 vigorously addressed. Has to be. \nBut our men and women in blue \u2013 and you know this \u2013 the men and women in blue need your support. They need your thanks and they need your gratitude. \nThey are the lines separating civilians and civilization from total chaos. \nThey\u2019re also the front lines of defense in the war on terror, as we saw recently with their quick action following the terrorist attacks in New Jersey and New York. \nAnd the off duty police officers \u2013 I mean you saw the heroics of the off duty police officers in Minnesota. An amazing job they did catching this horrible person so quickly. How do you do that? They figured it out and within a short period of time they were able to catch him. I mean, who could do that? That\u2019s tougher than finding oil, I will tell you. Right? \nIn addition to providing safety we must provide economic opportunity. That begins with school choice and leads to a secure job with a rising income. \nThis brings us to the subject of energy. \nProducing more American energy is a central part of my plan to making America wealthy again, especially for the poorest Americans. \nI knew I\u2019d have to make that statement in order to get you guys a little bit enlivened. You\u2019ll like the rest of what I\u2019m going to say even more. \nAmerica is sitting a treasure trove of untapped energy. \nSome $50 trillion in shale energy, oil reserves, and natural gas on federal lands in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves. It\u2019s all upside for this country \u2013 more jobs, more revenues, more wealth, higher wages, and lower energy prices. \nI\u2019m going to lift the restrictions on American energy and allow this wealth to pour into our communities, including right here in the state of Pennsylvania that we love. \nAccording to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on American energy, including shale production, will accomplish the following: \nIncrease GDP by more than $100 billion each year. That\u2019s good music. \nAdd over 500,000 new jobs annually. \nIncrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next seven years. \nIncrease federal, state, and local tax revenues almost $6 trillion over four decades. \nIncrease total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years. \nIn addition, we will probably streamline the permitting process, which probably makes you happier even than when I\u2019m going to say we\u2019re lowing taxes. The permitting process in your industry is a disaster. It\u2019s a disaster. \nEvery friend I have in your industry, they tell me it has become horrible with the EPA. So we\u2019re going to take care of that. \nAnd all energy infrastructure projects including the billions of dollars held up by President Obama. \nBut there is no right in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others. \nEvery single American in our country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to a very rapid end. \nThe people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant. It\u2019s their job, housing markets, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. \nAnd the first duty of government is to protect their well-being and safety. We have to do that. \nThere is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration. Never. Ever. \nOur job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace,  to walk their kids to school, and to get their children great educations. We have to cherish and protect those people. \nFor every one violent protester, there are thousands of moms and dads and kids in that same community who just want to be able to sleep safely at night, to be able to walk on the streets, to be able to go to the grocery store. \nMore law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs. And we need it quickly. \nLast year we saw 17% rise in violent crime in our 50 largest cities. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago so far this year from Jan. 1st. Can you believe that?  \nNationwide approximately 60% of murder victims under the age of 22 are African-American. \nThis is a national crisis and it\u2019s the job of the next president of the United States to work with our governors and mayors to address this crisis and safe African-American lives. \nLook at the example that we had in New York of Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who has been a tremendous person for me and a good friend of mine for a long time and a big endorsement. Big, big endorsement. \nThe policies he put into place ultimately brought down crime by 76% and murder in New York by 84%. \nThink of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache imaginable. \nWe need a national anti-crime agenda to make our city safe again. We have to make our cities safe again. \nWe will appoint the best prosecutors, investigators, and federal law enforcement officers in the country to dismantle the international cartels, gangs, criminals syndicates. \nAnd I will stop the drugs from flowing into the country and poisoning our youth and many other people. \nAnd if you\u2019re not aware drugs are a very, very big factor in what you\u2019re watching on television at night. \nMy administration will work with local communities and local officials to make the reduction of crime to make the reduction of crime a top priority. \nSafety is the foundation of the ladder to American success \u2013 a great education and a really good paying job. \nWe\u2019ve lost so many of ours good jobs to other countries. We\u2019re going to be bringing them back right here to Pittsburgh to Pennsylvania. We\u2019re going to be bringing them back to Ohio. We\u2019re going to be bringing them back all over the country. They\u2019re coming back. They\u2019re coming back. \n...To have the best schools and the best jobs, you must have safe communities. That means we must recognize the contribution of our police who come from all backgrounds and all walks of life and who often thanklessly risk their own lives to protect innocent people, many of whom they\u2019ve never met.  \n...You will like me so much. You will get that business. You know, all my life that business has never had problems, but in the last 7 or 8 years it\u2019s been tough. With the EPA with all of the different difficulties you\u2019re going through. \nYou are going to like Donald Trump and all of the workers that get put to work they\u2019re going to love Donald Trump. So, that\u2019s good. \n... We\u2019ve had some great poll numbers come out just today. Rasmussen is 5 up nationwide and I guess you probably saw Ohio is doing great. We\u2019re 4 or 5 up. The Fox poll came out last night. We\u2019re doing great. \nPretty much we\u2019re doing great where we have to do great. Florida\u2019s been terrific, and I think we\u2019re going to have a big, big victory right here in the state of Pennsylvania and I think it\u2019s going to be a big victory. \nI went to school here. My children went to school here so it\u2019s a very special place to me. \nI also want to thank the Marcellus Shale Coalition and Ohio Oil and Gas Association and The West Virginia \u2013 oh that West Virginia, what a, what a victory I had there. It was almost like running unopposed. All of the folks in West Virginia they have been so great. They have been great. Great from day one. \nAnd now what helped when Hillary made the statement \u201cI\u2019m going to put all those mines and miners out of business.\u201d That was not a good statement to make. I don\u2019t know, maybe she knew something I don\u2019t know. \nBut your organizations represent tens of thousands of jobs for hardworking Americans. \n...But they tell me that a Republican can\u2019t carry the state of Pennsylvania. Wait until you see what happens here. Wait till you see. And I don\u2019t believe it and you don\u2019t believe it and I think you\u2019re going to have yourself not only a victory, but a really big one. That\u2019s going to go a long way to tell you what a wonderful industry you\u2019re in. \nAnd I have to say, do whatever you can to get out to vote Nov. 8th. Do whatever you can because a lot of things are happening. A lot of forces are happening. Whatever you can. \nSo it\u2019s great to be Pittsburgh, the steel city. I have a lot of friends here. \nUnder a Trump administration, we\u2019re going to bring back our steel jobs and we\u2019re going to rebuild this nation so importantly. \nBefore going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country, and it seems to be a never ending problem. \nAmerica desperately needs unity and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not really only got us through our toughest times \u2013 and we\u2019ve had some tough times \u2013 but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation. \nEveryday I see people of different backgrounds working together for a common good and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation united by shared values and principles as American citizens. \nWe have to do it, and we have respect our flag. We have to respect our flag. \nWe all have to walk a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes, see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. \nI mean, we have some will problems and we do have a wounded country. Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. \nOur country looks bad to the world especially when we are supposed to be the world\u2019s leader. How can we lead when we can\u2019t even control our own cities? \nWe honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech after winning Florida, Illinois, and North Carolina on March 15, 2016", "text": "And I have to say that number one, I want to congratulate Marco Rubio on having run a really tough campaign. He\u2019s tough. He\u2019s smart. And he\u2019s got a great future. He\u2019s got a great future. \nBut I have to say and nobody has ever, ever in the history of politics received the kind of negative advertising that I have. Record, record, record. By the way, mostly false. I wouldn\u2019t say 100% but about 90%. Mostly false, vicious, horrible. \nThey said it was $18 million the first week, meaning last week, and $25 million. It added up to over $40 million. \nAnd you explain it to me because I can\u2019t \u2013 my numbers went up. I don\u2019t understand it. Nobody understands it. My numbers went up. \nI mean, it\u2019s been an interesting experience. Last week, Adam Scott won at the Trump National Doral. Won the big tournament, the world championship of golf. And Adam, who\u2019s a great guy \u2013 I guess a lot of you folks saw that \u2013 but I\u2019m watching...we have television screens all over. We\u2019re down at this gorgeous green at Doral and everything is working beautifully and then a commercial comes on. The worst commercial and I\u2019m with these wonderful people from Cadillac and all these top executives, and I\u2019m saying, \u201cLook over there! Look! Don\u2019t watch it. Don\u2019t. You don\u2019t want to watch it.\u201d I\u2019m saying, \u201cIsn\u2019t the grass beautiful? Look! Look! Don\u2019t watch.\u201d  \nAnd they came in waves one after another after another and it was brutal. \nAnd then Adam comes in. He\u2019s this handsome kid from Australia, one of the greatest golfers in the world, made an unbelievable shot on the 18th hole to win the tournament. He\u2019s a great champion. And we\u2019re giving the award. \nAnd just before we break for a commercial, \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back with our great champion from Australia, Adam Scott\u201d and here\u2019s the commercial and I said, \u201cNo!\u201d And it was two of them \u2013 two of them. Oh, what a day that was. What a disaster. What a disaster. Unbelievable. \nSo again, I just want to congratulate everybody. This is a really interesting process. It\u2019s an amazing process. It\u2019s very tough. But it is \u2013 by the end, if you get to the end, you can handle a lot of things including pressure because there\u2019s nothing like it. Lies, deceit, viciousness, disgusting reporters, horrible people. It\u2019s true. Some are nice. Some are nice. Some really disgusting people back there. \nAnd I just want to say we\u2019re going to go forward and we\u2019re going to win. But more importantly, we\u2019re going to win for the country. We\u2019re going to win, win, win, and we\u2019re not stopping. We\u2019re going to have great victories for our country. \nThank you very much everybody! Thank you! \nSo, we started and something happened called Paris. Paris happened and Paris was a disaster. That was \u2013 there have been many disasters. But it was Paris. \nAnd then we had a case in Los Angeles where it was in California where the 14 young people were killed. And it just goes on and on and on. \nAnd what happened with me is this whole run took on a whole new meaning, not just borders, not just good trade deals. We\u2019re going to make the best trade deals you\u2019ve ever seen. \nWe\u2019ve got such endorsements from Carl Icahn and the smartest people in business. And these people are going to be negotiating our deals and they\u2019re the best in the world. We have the best business people in the world. We\u2019re going to have such great deals. We\u2019re going to do so good with trade. We\u2019re going to do so good on the border. \nBut it took on a whole new meaning, and the meaning was very simple. We need protection in our country and that\u2019s going to happen and all of a sudden the poll numbers shot up. And I\u2019m just very proud to be a part of this. \nI think we\u2019re going to go. We\u2019re going to go on a lot of trips over the next month but I think we\u2019re going to have a great victory. \nAnd I think more importantly than anything else we are going to start winning again. This country is going to start winning again. We don\u2019t win anymore. \nWe don\u2019t win with our military. We can\u2019t beat ISIS. We\u2019re going to knock the hell out of them. \nWe don\u2019t win at trade \u2013 China, everybody, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam, India, name the country. Anybody we deal, anybody we do business with beats us. We don\u2019t win at trade. We\u2019re going to win at trade. We\u2019re going to make our country rich again. We\u2019re going to make our country great again. And we need the rich in order to make the great, I\u2019m sorry to tell you. \nSo, I\u2019m going forward. We had a fantastic evening. I would have never thought this could have happened. I guess we\u2019re waiting for one result which possibly will be very successful also. \nBut to win the states that we\u2019ve won and to win by the margins and especially, look, this is my second home, Florida. To win by that kind of a number is incredible. It\u2019s record-setting. \nI want to pay my respects by the way to Todd Palin, Sarah\u2019s husband. Sarah was here. She was incredible. She was making a speech on my behalf and fantastic and everybody loves her. And what happened is he was in a very bad accident. He\u2019s tough as nails. He\u2019s going to be fine. But I just wanted to pay my respects by the way to Todd.  \nSo, our theme when we started and Melania and I came down. Yeah, sit down everybody. Please. I mean, this is Mar-a-Lago. We give you seats. You don\u2019t have to stand. I\u2019m looking at all these people. \nCory, good job, Cory. Good job. And Hope and our whole squad. Right? \nSo when this began, Melania and I and I said, \u201cGot to do it.\u201d And she was so supportive and she\u2019s been so supportive. It\u2019s been amazing. And we have to do it. \nWe came down the escalator and it was about trade and it was about borders. And what happened is pretty quickly after that and we were \u2013 we shot right up. I shot right to the top of the polls and have been leading in the polls almost from the beginning without fail. \nWe went up in June. Most people said I\u2019ll never run. He\u2019s just going to have fun. He\u2019s having a good time. This isn\u2019t necessarily \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m having a good time. You know, I\u2019m having a very nice time. But you know what? I\u2019m working very hard and there is great anger. Believe me. There is great anger. \nOne of the broadcasters was saying, \u201cIs there anger?\u201d And I said...I was supposed to say, \u201cNo, there\u2019s not. We love the way things are working. We love the deal you made with Iran. It\u2019s wonderful. You give them $150 billion. We get nothing. We love all the deals. The trade deals are wonderful. You lose $500 billion a year with China. We lose $58 billion a year in terms of imbalance. It\u2019s a total imbalance.\u201d \nWe don\u2019t make good deals anymore. We don\u2019t win anymore. As a country, we don\u2019t win anymore. \nAnd they asked, \u201cIs there anger from your people?\u201d ...They\u2019re not angry people but they want to see the country properly run. They want to see borders. They want to see good health care. They want to see things properly taken care of. They want our military rebuilt. Our military is in a very bad state. They want it rebuilt. Very, very importantly, and they want the Second Amendment by the way protected and protected strongly and that\u2019s going to happen. \nAnd you know what they want so badly? They want our veterans taken care of. Our veterans are treated so badly. \nYou\u2019re traveling all over the place. It\u2019s really amazing. Yesterday I went up to Ohio. I went up to Youngstown. \nWe had an incredible crowd and just amazing people in this country. We have so, so many great people. \nWe will someday in the not so distant future if I win \u2013 otherwise it\u2019s not going to happen I have to be honest with you. But Apple and all of these great companies will be making their product in the United States, not in China, Vietnam and all of \u2013 \nAnd we\u2019re not going to be losing our companies. You know, our companies are leaving our country rapidly, rapidly, whether it\u2019s Carrier air conditioning, whether it\u2019s Ford, whether it\u2019s Eaton. \nI was in Cleveland and Eaton Corp. they\u2019re leaving and so many companies are leaving. And frankly, I\u2019m disgusted with it and I\u2019m tired of seeing it and there\u2019s no reason for it. It\u2019s just gross incompetence at the highest level. We should not allow it to happen. Pfizer, great company, pharmaceutical company, they\u2019re going to Ireland. \nAnd there\u2019s so many more. You have corporate inversions. You have people who can\u2019t get their money back into the country because the politicians can\u2019t get along. They can\u2019t make a deal. \nEverybody agrees \u2013 Democrat and Republican \u2013 everybody agrees the money should come back...trillion dollars outside of this country. Everybody agrees that the money should be here and the politicians for three years haven\u2019t been able to make a deal. \nAnd we could make a deal. There\u2019s an example of something that you could do if I sat down with a few of the senators, a few of the congressmen, you could make a deal on that in 10 minutes if you know what you\u2019re doing because everybody wants to do it. \nAnd companies are actually leaving our country to get their money, not only because our taxes are too high, which we\u2019re going to lower by the way. But companies are leaving our country in order to go and get money that\u2019s their money because there\u2019s no way of bringing it in. \nSo, we\u2019ve got a long way to go. But I think at some point it\u2019s going to get done. This has been very exciting, this whole process. \nWe started, I was one of 17 people \u2013 senators, governors. I\u2019ve had such great support. Dr. Ben Carson the other day endorsed us. Great guy. Great guy. Wonderful man. And Chris Christie endorsed us. That was so incredible. \nAnd today Pam Bondi came up and endorsed us. She was great. She is a truly wonderful woman, of the job she\u2019s done in Florida is incredible. \nYou know, so many \u2013 we\u2019ve had such incredible support. Paul Ryan called me the other day \u2013 tremendous call. I spoke with Mitch McConnell today. We had a great conversation. \nThe fact is we have to bring our party together. We have to bring it together. \nWe have something happening that actually makes the Republican Party probably the biggest political story anywhere in the world. Everybody\u2019s writing about it all over Europe, all over the world they\u2019re talking about it. \nMillions of people are coming in to vote. This was an example of it today. Many, many more people. I\u2019m looking at the polling booths. I\u2019m looking at the different polling booths all around the country where it\u2019s up. And the lines are four, five, six blocks long. And the woman \u2013 one woman was there for 40 years. She\u2019s been working the polls. And she said, \u201cWe\u2019d have two people here. We\u2019d have three people. Now look at the line.\u201d And the line looked like it was, you know, long. It was really long. Five deep and long. And it\u2019s just a different thing. \nWe have a great opportunity and the people that are voting are Democrats are coming in, Independents are coming in, and very, very importantly, people that never voted before. It\u2019s an incredible thing. \nThank you. Thank you! Thank you very much everybody. This was an amazing evening. This was a great evening. \nThey just announced North Carolina. \nI don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve even announced Illinois yet but we\u2019re leading by a lot so I think they\u2019re going to announce it. \nFlorida was so amazing. \nAnd I want to thank our friends. Northern Marianas Islands have been so incredible, and we picked up nine delegates this morning. I heard very early in the morning \u2013 nine delegates. That\u2019s a lot. \nAnd I just wanted to thank the governor, Ralph Torres, great guy, Chairman [James] Ada who was a fantastic man and that was a very nice start to the day. That I can tell you. \nMany things have been happening over the last short period of time. \nCNN was very nice. They came up with a poll. The poll said 49% to 14% and 15%. \nWe just had one from the Economist just came out \u2013 53%. \nAnd it was sort of interesting because I was watching the news a little while ago and one of the commentators, who I\u2019m not particularly fond of but these are minor details, said \u201cBut Donald Trump doesn\u2019t get over 50%\u201d because I\u2019m at 43%, 45%. \nActually now according to the Economist, I\u2019m at 53%. \nAnd I have to explain to these people they don\u2019t understand basic physics, basic mathematics, basic whatever you want to call it. When I don\u2019t get over 50%, we have four people. Right? We have four people. Do you understand that? \nSo when I get 53% \u2013 and this one is an example, I had 53% and that\u2019s with four people. That\u2019s an achievement just mathematically when you can get over 50%. \nSo someday, someday they\u2019re going to understand, someday when we take it all, they\u2019ll understand. But it is really ridiculous. \nI want to thank my family. My boy, Eric and Don. They\u2019ve been working so hard. \nIvanka and Jared have been amazing. Ivanka\u2019s home right now. In about two minutes, I\u2019ll call her. She\u2019s about to have a baby so I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve been thinking about that now for a little while but Ivanka has been so helpful and Jared has been amazing and it\u2019s been just great. \nI want to thank Barron for putting up with the fact that I never see him anymore. And I want to thank Barron. I never see my Barron and it\u2019s his birthday on Sunday so we\u2019re very happy about that. \nSo it\u2019s a little tough. You know, we\u2019re going away and he goes, \u201cWhen are you going to be come home, daddy? When are you coming home?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, in about two and a half weeks.\u201d It\u2019s been pretty tough. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Tampa, Florida", "text": "I just found a second mike. I\u2019m probably being wired or tapped here. \nIt\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s got to be the Justice Department doing that. \nWhere\u2019s this mike \u2013 I\u2019m saying to myself where the hell did this second mike come from? \nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. \nWe\u2019re going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan. Even bigger. She\u2019s going to raise your taxes. \nWe will eliminate every unnecessary job killing regulation \u2013 such a big thing, such a big thing. \nCancel every illegal Obama executive order. \nWe are going to protect religious liberty. \nWe will rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans like they\u2019ve never been taken care of before. They\u2019ve been badly treated. That won\u2019t happen. \nWe already have a plan for the veterans and they love it and we have overwhelming support from the veterans. Our great people \u2013 we don\u2019t take care of them. \nWe will provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. We will bring our education local. \nWe will support the men and women of law enforcement. \nWe are going to save our Second Amendment, which is under siege. We have the endorsement of the NRA \u2013 National Rifle Association. \nAnd I have to tell you, these are great people \u2013 Wayne and Chris and all of them. They love this country. They love this country. They gave me the earliest endorsement they\u2019ve ever given to a presidential candidate. We\u2019re going to save our Second Amendment. Great people. \nAnd we will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \nIt is time to cut our ties with the failed politicians like Hillary of our past. \nHillary Clinton is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. \nAnd they\u2019ve never seen a movement like this, folks. They\u2019ve never ever seen a movement like this. There has never been anything like this in this country\u2019s history. And we have to close it out on Nov. 8th or sooner. \nBy the way, who\u2019s voted? \nAll right, that\u2019s about 80%. 20% \u2013 leave right now. Vote. Okay. Just vote before the 8th. \nThe numbers are looking good. That I can tell you. \nDid you guys vote? Did you vote? \nBlacks for Trump. You voted. Right? Good. Good. Thank you. \nWe are fighting for every parent who lost their child to drugs and crime and gang violence. \nWe are fighting for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out of our country and shipped to other faraway lands. It\u2019s happening all the time. \nAnd we are fighting for every American who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. \nI\u2019m asking you to dream big because your vote \u2013 think of this. We are just three days away \u2013 do you believe that? \nWe\u2019ll bring about the change you\u2019ve been waiting for your entire life. This will be a very important day. \nAnd I know that the vote that you cast will be the most important vote of your life because our country doesn\u2019t win anymore. \nWe will start winning. \nWe will knock out ISIS. Believe me. We have no choice. We will knock them out. We will win at the borders. We will start winning again. \nWe\u2019ll win so much you\u2019re going to get sick and tired of winning. Is that possible? You\u2019ll say, \u201cPlease, Mr. President, you\u2019re winning too much. Let\u2019s take it easy.\u201d \nWe are going to win so much. You\u2019re going to be so proud of your country, and hopefully, you\u2019re going to be proud of your president. \nTogether, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. \nThank you very much everybody! Thank you. Thank you. Get out and vote. God bless you everybody. God bless you. Get out and vote. \nYou know, I was a little worried about the debates because for a week and a half, I\u2019d hear she\u2019s not going out of her house. She\u2019s doing debate prep. \nI said wait a minute. How can you work that \u2013 I mean, you\u2019re supposed to know this stuff. Right? \nYou know, I mean, she has a lot of experience. That\u2019s the one thing she has. She\u2019s got a lot of experience but it\u2019s all bad experience. It\u2019s the experience of losing. \nBut she kept doing debate prep. Right? \nAnd I felt guilty. I said, yeah, I don\u2019t want to sit. What am I going to do debate \u2013 you mean, 10 hours a day for a week and a half? I can\u2019t do that. \nWe\u2019re supposed to know this subject. Aren\u2019t we? We\u2019re supposed to know this subject. \nAnyway, she did debate prep. I don\u2019t think it helped her very much. \nHillary and her failed establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that we never win. \nBy the way, we fight. We keep fighting. We fight, fight, fight. \nAnd I always say General Douglas MacArthur, General George Patton, what are they doing? They\u2019re spinning in their graves. They can\u2019t believe it. \nMosul \u2013 we go into Mosul. \nLadies and gentlemen, we will be attacking Mosul in four months from now. Now that people at Mosul \u2013 you know, these guys are tough and they\u2019re smart, in all fairness. \nSo the ISIS \u2013 one of the reasons we\u2019re going into Mosul is we want to get the ISIS leaders. We think they\u2019re staying in Mosul and we want to get them. \nWell, before the announcement is over, they\u2019ve gone. Whatever happened to the element of surprise? The element of surprise? What a group of losers we have. \nAnd now it\u2019s a very tough battle. They\u2019ve dug in. It\u2019s much tougher than they thought. \nNo, we need different thinking in this country, folks. They should have quietly kept their mouth shut, quietly, quickly, and viciously go in and then have a news conference when it\u2019s over a week later. Right? \nAnd I\u2019m convinced they only did that for political reasons. They thought it was going to be a great quick victory. It wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s a disaster. They thought it was going to be a quick victory. \nAnd you know, Hillary\u2019s running and then she\u2019ll get credit. Except for one problem. We already had Mosul. So we gave it up because of the way they got out and then ISIS was formed. ISIS is now in 32 countries \nBut during the debate, I watched and she\u2019s saying we\u2019re going to fix our tax code. \nWell, why didn\u2019t you do it? \nBecause all of her people are doing the same thing. We\u2019re all doing the same thing. \nAnd we\u2019re going to fix our tax code. We\u2019re going to do this. We\u2019re going to do that. We\u2019re going to fix this. \nAnd I kept saying, you\u2019ve been there for 30 years. Why didn\u2019t you do it? It will never happen. \nThey\u2019ve dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe, shipped our goods and our wealth, and our companies to other countries, and they\u2019ve left our borders wide open. So we have no borders and yet we\u2019re over fighting for countries that a lot of people in this room have never heard of. And we want a border. We\u2019re fighting to they have a border but we don\u2019t protect our own border. \nThat will change on Nov. 8th. \nA Trump administration will never ever put the interests of a foreign country before the interest of our country. \nFrom now, it\u2019s going to be America first. \nTo all Americans I say it is time for change. It is time for new leadership. \nAnd in closing, I want you to think about \u2013 \nThank you, folks. I just see a sign that I love. Let me see that. Let me see. Let me have this. Let me have it. I love that sign. It\u2019s true. I love that sign! \nI love all the signs \u2013 women for Trump, blacks for Trump, Hispanics for Trump. \nThank you. \nAnd by the way I\u2019ve said it, this guy is campaigning full-time. \nShe can\u2019t campaign for herself. Nobody shows up to her meetings. The only way she gets them to show up is when she has a star come. That\u2019s the only way. The other way she gets 500 people, 400 people. \nAnd by the way, the cameras never show that. \nCan you imagine if I had a small crowd? There\u2019d be headlines all over the world, \nTrump, you know, not doing it, right? But she has these little crowds show up. It\u2019s a big problem. \nLook, she can\u2019t do more than one or two a day \u2018cause she has no energy. But she can\u2019t do it because they can\u2019t get any people. \nBut Obama goes and campaigns for her. He ought to spend time in the Oval Office getting jobs, defeating ISIS, strengthening up our border. \nAmong those killed, Americans like Josh Wilkerson, whose mother I\u2019ve gotten to know during this campaign. \nJosh was a student in a high school, great student. He was murdered at the age of 17. He was tortured, strangled, and beaten to death by an illegal immigrant who should have never been in our country. And then his body was set on fire. \nYou ought to look at The Remembrance Project. These people are amazing people. These are people that suffered so much. \nLast year, right here in Florida, 17-year-old Starlet Pitts [sp], her boyfriend, and her mother were viciously stabbed to death in their Lehigh Acres home by an illegal immigrant. \nThe killer had been convicted of assaulting a police officer and was wanted for double murder and robbery. But he was released from custody, enabling him to commit these and other horrible crimes. \nAnd the people that knew him begged that he be incarcerated or begged that he be thrown the hell out of our country. And the Obama administration, with their weak policies, refused to listen. Gaff. \nA Trump administration will end this nightmare of violence. We will protect American lives. We will cancel all federal funding of sanctuary cities. Very important. \nWe will stop illegal immigration, deport every last criminal alien, and dismantle every criminal gang and cartel threatening our great citizens. \nWhen we win this election, you will finally have a government on your side, fighting for your community, and protecting your family. \nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. Greatest people on earth. \nModern aircraft from MacDill. And we\u2019ll have to do this. Anybody? MacDill. We\u2019re going to have beautiful, beautiful new \u2013 you know, right now, our fighter jets \u2013 some are so old they can\u2019t get parts. They don\u2019t make them anymore. 18, 19 years old. They did a big documentary about it. \nWe\u2019re going to take care of those brand new, beautiful jets out of MacDill. Okay? \nI\u2019m honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. I actually heard we picked up about five today. \nAnd I want to thank the coach for getting up here and talking to you people. What a great coach. \nAnd Joe, and your attorney general. You have so many great people. \nAll of the people that got up and spoke, I want to thank them. They\u2019re speaking all over the country. They\u2019re speaking all over the country. \nHillary brought death and disaster to Iraq, Syria, Libya, and she empowered Iran. \nThey\u2019ve been empowered. They\u2019ve been emboldened. \nWe gave them $150 billion, and they hate us. But now they\u2019re strong. We\u2019ve created them. We\u2019ve \u2013 They were ready to die. They were to come back and make any deal we wanted, and we took them out of the ashes. And we made them, perhaps, a world power, not just a regional power. \nAll Hillary Clinton\u2019s thinking. Bad judgment. Bad instincts. \nAnd she unleashed ISIS all across the world. \nDuring the debates \u2013 did I win the debates? Did I win the debates? \nAnd we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. \nYou look at what happened in France. You look like what\u2019s happened in Germany. \nNo. \nAnd we all have big hearts. We\u2019ll build safe havens. We\u2019ll have the Gulf states put up the money. \nWe owe \u2013 what do we owe? $20 trillion. We owe $20 trillion. Think of it. \nBut I\u2019ll get the Gulf states \u2013 they have plenty of money. They have so much money, they don\u2019t know what to do with it. They just have to be told nicely. Right? They\u2019re gonna put up the money. \nWe\u2019ll build safe havens in Syria but we can\u2019t have this, folks. We have enough problems. We don\u2019t need these kinds of problems. \nA Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. \nAnd as we said, yes, we will build a great wall. \nWe received the first ever endorsement issued by America\u2019s I.C,E. and Border Patrol Officers. \nIt\u2019s just been reported that as a result of our open borders, violent cartels have spread into all 50 states. \nMore than 90% of those arrested are here illegally. Aren\u2019t you shocked? 90% think of it. 90% are here illegally. \nThank you darling. I love you too. It\u2019s so nice. \nOh, look, a future construction worker. Look. Look at the baby he\u2019s so cute. Give me that baby. \nFuture construction worker. \nThey did a great job. Wow! That is a great beautiful baby. Congratulations. \nThat\u2019s an early Trump fan. Right? That\u2019s an early United States fan. \nAnyway, back to the basics. After going through that, I hate to say this. \nBut these terrorists are killing innocent Americans, threatening schools, and destroying our communities. \nA government that will not protect its people is a government that is unworthy to lead. \nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminals to come into the country, go free, and wouldn\u2019t send them back to their home countries. \nWhen they did their home countries very, very intelligently said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want them. Take them back,\u201d and we would never force them in. \nAnd I promise you when we take these killers and gang members and drug lords back to their countries, they will be accepted gladly by their country. Okay? \n\u201cThank you so much for bringing this killer back Mr. Trump. We totally appreciate it.\u201d \nThey\u2019ll say, \u201cPresident Trump, thank you, sir. We very much welcome. We\u2019re so so happy \u2013 Mr. President, we\u2019re so so happy to have our drug lords back, to have our killers back, to have our gang members back. Thank you, Mr President, on behalf of\u201d \u2013 I won\u2019t use the name of the country. \nHillary supports total open borders and the end of your country. And strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Fransico where Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant that got deported. This was a man that was probably deported more than five times. \nThousands of Americans would be alive today if not for the open border policies of Barak Obama and Hilary Clinton. \nHillary Clinton is going to raise taxes substantially. Highest taxed nation. She wants to raise taxes substantially. \nThat\u2019s not going to happen. \nWe will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations and use that money to invest in America. \nThat includes repairing so many of Florida\u2019s problems. \nThank you. Thank you. \nWe\u2019re going to repair so many of Florida\u2019s problems and everyone\u2019s problems. Including the Herbert Hoover Dike, which is big problem, and the Florida Aquifer. \nAnd we\u2019re going to protect the everglades. \nWe\u2019re going to do all of the things, but we\u2019re going to have so much money left over, folks. \nYou know what we want? You know what we want? \nWe want really beautiful, clean air. Right? \nWe want really crystal, crystal clean water. \nAnd we want safety. \nWe don\u2019t need to give hundreds of billions of dollars away. We have no idea who\u2019s getting this money. Giving it to the United Nations. You know what that\u2019s called? Giving it to an open pit. \nYou know how political the United... can you imagine as these guys are doling out that money? \nNo, no, we\u2019re going to keep our money here, and we\u2019re going to take care of our infrastructure, and we\u2019re going to take care of our environment. And we\u2019re going to lower taxes. \nWe will also rebuild our inner cities. The African-American community has been treated terribly. Terribly. \nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so honored to see those signs. And I\u2019m telling you, that\u2019s, that\u2019s turning out to be the story of this election. The African-American vote. \nWatch, we watch. They\u2019ve been treated very unfairly. \nAfrican-American and Hispanic people living in the inner cities. There\u2019s no. \nOh, you like that Hispanics, huh? How many Hispanics do we have here? \nAnd by the way, that\u2019s a big story. \nYou know, as you know, the Cubans just endorsed me. They gave me the Bay of Pigs Association Award. \nWe\u2019ll be making a much different deal than they made with Castro, believe me, folks. They\u2019re very happy. \nBut that\u2019s another story that\u2019s turning out to be very big. The Hispanic vote. It\u2019s turning out to be much different than people thought. \nBut the African-American community, the Hispanic community, the folks living in the inner cities, crime ridden. \nYou can\u2019t walk to the store and buy a loaf of bread. You get shot. \nThe education is the worst. And there\u2019s no jobs. \nWe\u2019re going to fix the education. We\u2019re going to bring back jobs. And we\u2019re going to bring back safety. \nAnd I say to the Hispanic community living in the inner cities, to the African-American community, I say, \u201cWhat in the hell do you have to lose?\u201d I\u2019m going to fix it. I\u2019m going to fix it. I am going to fix it. \nYou know, the Democrats have been running that whole thing for up to 100 years, unbroken. And they come in and they say \u201cWe want your vote. We want your vote.\u201d And then you give them the vote. \nYou know this, fellas, right? You know that. They know. \nYou give them your vote, and they just disappear for four years. They say \u201cSee you, folks. See you in four years.\u201d \nAnd then they come back, again and again. \nWe have to show them, it doesn\u2019t work that way anymore. \nAnd they\u2019ll never be able to do \u2013 they\u2019ll never be able to do what I do. \nLook, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m doing five or six of these a day. And Hillary goes home and she goes to sleep. \nIf she wanted to do it, which she doesn\u2019t, she doesn\u2019t have the energy to do it. Believe me. \nWe will become a rich nation again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. \nHillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees pouring into this country over and above the thousands and thousands and thousands that are already coming in. \nYou want to see a problem? This will be the great Trojan horse, modern day version. \nHer plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into our schools and throughout your communities. \nWhen I\u2019m elected president, we will suspend immediately the Syrian refugee program. \nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we, we are about to say. \nWhen we win on Nov. 8th, we are going to drain the swamp. \nThey\u2019re not happy, folks. They\u2019re not happy. There are a lot of unhappy people around. \nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back your jobs that have been stolen. Stolen by either very stupid politicians or corrupt politicians, meaning special interests get them to do whatever they want to do. \nFlorida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary. \nAmerica has lost 70,000 factories. That\u2019s such a hard number to believe, 70,000, since China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary backed disaster. \nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. \nThere has never been a country that\u2019s lost jobs like we do. \nSo stupidly. So easy to solve. So stupidly. \nGoodrich Lighting Systems \u2013 \nWe will, I promise. I promise. \nGoodrich Lighting Systems laid off 255 workers and moved their jobs to India. \nBaxter Healthcare Corporation laid off 199 workers and moved their jobs to Singapore. \nEsler Laboratories laid off 181 workers, and moved their jobs, surprise, to Mexico. \nTremendous, tremendous jobs, and it\u2019s getting worse and worse and worse. \nWe have with some of these countries, Mexico in particular. I have a great relationship with Mexico. I\u2019ve met with the Mexican resident three months ago. \nBelieve me, I will build a wall. Don\u2019t even think about it. We\u2019ll build a wall. Don\u2019t worry about it. \nAnd you know what? The harder they fight us, the higher it goes. Okay? I promise. \nNo, but I met with the president of Mexico. Look, and he\u2019s a good guy, good guy. Good meeting, all of that. \nLook, we have a one lane highway goes right into Mexico, takes our jobs, takes our money, takes our wealth, takes everything. And we get unemployment and we get drugs. \nNot going to happen anymore, folks. \nA Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and will stop the jobs from leaving the great state of Florida. That I can tell you. \nThe theft of American prosperity will end quickly and effectively. \nIf a company wants to fire their workers, leave Florida, move to another country, and then ship their product back into the United States, we will make them pay a tax of 35%. \nProblem solved. Problem solved. \n99%, and you never heard this talk before, you know. They give them loans, \u201cOh, we want you to stay.\u201d They don\u2019t even talk to most of them. You know, most of them just leave. Nobody talks to them. We\u2019ll talk to them. \nAnd at first, we\u2019ll be very nice. Right? First, we\u2019ll be very nice and respectful. And when they tell us no, no, no, then we\u2019ll say, okay, here\u2019s the story, folks. Let\u2019s not be nice anymore. \nAnd you know what\u2019s going to happen with that tax? They\u2019re never going to leave this country. They\u2019re never leaving. They\u2019re never going to leave this country. \nA Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA, and if we don\u2019t get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal for our workers. \nWe will immediately stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, another disaster in the making. \nThat Hillary Clinton said is the gold standard. Yeah, it\u2019s the gold standard for other countries, not for us. The gold standard for the countries that want to be a part of that deal. \nAs part of our plan to bring back jobs, we\u2019re going to lower taxes on American business from 35% to 15%. \nWe\u2019re the highest taxed nation in the world. One of the main reasons that they\u2019re leaving. \nWe will massively cut taxes for the middle class also. \nAnd by the way, don\u2019t hear it from me. Just look at it. \nRemember Bill Clinton just happened when he was in Phoenix Arizona, just happened to see her plane. The Attorney General\u2019s plane. \nOh, there\u2019s the Attorney General. Oh what an unbelievable \u2013 He was gonna play golf. It was about 110 degrees. He was gonna play golf. \nOh, I was going to play golf. Let me say hello. Hey! Let\u2019s get together. \nBoom. I thought it was 39 minutes. Turned out to be 45 minutes. \nSo went on to the plane on the tarmac and right on the tarmac, and they had a meeting for 45 minutes right before she was supposed to issue her judgment on Hillary. \nAnd maybe Bill. Bill could be a target. Who knows? Because of what\u2019s going on. \nSo she met with him for 45 minutes. They discussed golf. That\u2019s about 2 minutes. They discussed grandchildren. Give them 5. \nThe rest of the time, what do you think they discussed? \nI would say like, I hope you\u2019re going to be a part of our administration. \nWhat do you think? \nWhat a disgrace. I\u2019ll tell what, our country has never been in a situation like it\u2019s in right now. Never been. So dishonest. \nIt\u2019s a rigged system, folks. I\u2019ve been saying it. It\u2019s a rigged system. \nAnd it begins with the media. Because the media rigs it. The media rigs it. \nDid you see all those reports? \nWhere the New York Times is sending them things, and they\u2019re saying, listen, we\u2019ve got this reporter essentially 100%. This is friendly stuff. \nWhere other reporters are sending them stories to check, \u201cDo you have any change?\u201d \nThis has never happened to me. Man. Actually, I used to get good publicity until I decided to run. \nNow, I think I have, and they even say, actually, the Times said, one of the writers of the Times said, \u201cWe don\u2019t care. We don\u2019t care if it\u2019s fair or not. It\u2019s so out of control. We don\u2019t care.\u201d \nIt\u2019s the greatest pile-on in the history of politics, and that\u2019s okay. \nI used to be on the other side though. And I did very well. But I also love our country and it was time. It was a time. We had to do something. It was time. \nBut that\u2019s a big part right there. A big part of the rigged system. \nRemember John Podesta said Hillary Clinton has bad instincts. Right? \nAnd I say to people, I\u2019d fire him. \nIf he was saying bad things, he\u2019s said so many bad things about her and he\u2019s her top person. He knows her well. \nAnd I don\u2019t want a president with bad instincts, and she does. All you have to do is look at her record. \nBernie Sanders says that she\u2019s got bad judgment. \nHillary created an illegal server to shield her criminal activity. That\u2019s why. There\u2019s no other reason. \nAnd she figured she was above it because she figured that the Department of Justice will never do anything to get in her way. Okay? It\u2019s a rigged system. \nThe Department of Justice, if that happened to anybody else, they would\u2019ve been in jail two years ago, folks. Okay? What she did. \nThen she illegally destroyed \u2013 and this is, this is, forget about what happened last Friday. I\u2019m talking about the past. \nForget about \u2013 that\u2019s all gravy. Whatever happened. \nWhat she did in the past is so bad. \nShe destroyed 30,000 \u2013 remember this, 33,000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena. The key word being after. And made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. \nIf she were to win, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. \nRemember, if she ever got into the Oval Office, Hillary and her special interests and her donors would rob this country blind. I have no doubt about it. \nMy contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take back our country from the special interest. \nOhio, just left, going back again soon. \nDoing phenomenally well in North Carolina. \nI think we\u2019re going to win Pennsylvania. I think we\u2019re going to win Pennsylvania. We\u2019re right there. \nI saw that they had... even is not like my thing, like you know we\u2019re even. But they had me way down in Pennsylvania. Then last night, I am looking and 2 to 3 polls came out. Uh, Jim, Trump, he\u2019s even right now in Pennsylvania too. This is not good. \nYou can see that \u2018cause they protect Hillary. I don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t understand why. \nWhen this is all over with, I\u2019m going sit down with the dishonest media. I\u2019m going to have an honest talk. Why? What is she going to do? \nShe\u2019s, she\u2019s a dishonest person. She has no energy. \nYou know, you need energy to help this country. \nLike for instance, I am going to be doing 5 or 6 of these everyday. You need energy here, folks. \nShe goes home and she goes to sleep. \nYou need a lot of energy. So we\u2019re going to be doing at least five of these today. The arenas are all packed all over the country. And we\u2019re going into different locations. \nWe\u2019re going into what they used to call \u2018Democrat strongholds\u2019, where we are now either tied or leading. \nWe\u2019re going to Minnesota. We\u2019re going up to Minnesota, which traditionally has not been Republican at all, and we are doing phenomenally. We just saw a poll. \nWe\u2019re going to Colorado, where we\u2019re doing phenomenally well. \nWe\u2019re doing well everywhere. We\u2019re doing well in places that they don\u2019t believe. They\u2019re saying what\u2019s going on? \nAnyway, with Obamacare, getting back to the boring subject. It\u2019s almost a waste of time talking about it because when we terminate it, all we\u2019ll do is say it was a bad experience for the American people. You know. \nPremiums are surging because of Obamacare. Companies are leaving. Insurers are fleeing. Doctors are quitting. \nAnd deductibles are going through the roof, some as high as $15,000, some higher than that. \nYet, Hillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. Going to make it much more expensive. \nYou know what they\u2019re going to do? Her and Obama? They\u2019re going to show you and they don\u2019t care what it takes. They\u2019re going to show you that it works. They\u2019re going to listen to Trump \u2013 never give up. Okay? They\u2019re going to show you. \nOkay, we don\u2019t want to be shown. I\u2019ll tell you what, it is catastrophic. \nI\u2019m asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare and have health care for every family in Florida and great health care. \nReal change also means restoring honesty to our government. \nAs you know, the FBI, and I give them a lot of credit because they are fighting forces that they\u2019re not supposed to be fighting, has re-opened its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton. \nThey\u2019re also conducting a second criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s pay for play corruption at the State Department. You see what\u2019s happening there. \nIt has been confirmed that the 650,000 emails they discovered by accident. Can you believe it? 650,000 emails. Oh that\u2019s a treasure trove. That is going to be a lot bad emails in there. \nThey discovered it on Anthony Weiner\u2019s. Think of it. Can you imagine it? Anthony Weiner probably has every classified email ever sent. And knowing this guy he probably studied every single one in between using his machine for other purposes. \nIncluding brand new emails not previously turned over to authorities, likely including some very, very classified information. \nHowever, the reports also show that the political leadership at the Department of Justice is trying very and hard as they can to protect their angel, Hillary. \nSo the great state of Texas, you heard. You heard. Can you believe all these people at ten o\u2019clock in the morning? Great. They got here at two o\u2019clock in the morning, my dear. \nSo, the great state of Texas, an incredible place. I go there. We have these massive crowds and about two weeks ago I was hearing the, the phonies in the media and they\u2019re going very, very strongly \u201cTexas in play!\u201d \nOh, we have a Hillary Clinton person. Are they paying that person $1,500? \nGet them out please. Get them out. \nI must tell you that Bernie Sanders\u2019s protesters had much more enthusiasm and spirit than this one. \nThe problem with these Hillary protesters is that my people make all the noise. They are always going \u201cThere, there!\u201d You can\u2019t even hear the person. \nBy the way did you see, before I get to Texas, did you see yesterday Obama screaming and screaming and screaming? \nJust like the way he runs the country nobody listens to him. Screaming! Okay? \nAnd I wanted to see the protesters because these lying, thieving people back there, the media, they don\u2019t ever show, they don\u2019t ever show my crowds. \nI was saying to them the other night. Where is she? I was saying \u201cYou\u2019ve got to show... you\u2019ve got to turn the cameras\u201d. They just every one of them right up my face. \nThe only time they will turn the cameras is when there\u2019s a protester because that\u2019s a bad thing. Right? \nSo, last night Obama had a protester, and they wouldn\u2019t turn the camera to the protester. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen that. They kept it on him but it was bad because he kept screaming the same thing over and over again, and nobody would listen to him. \nBut they had the great state of Texas. \nSo, about three weeks ago, they\u2019d say, they would do these phony polls. All right? Some of the polls are great. I only really acknowledge them if I\u2019m winning. So don\u2019t worry. \nAnd by the way, we\u2019re winning in a lot of polls. We don\u2019t have enough time to talk about it now. There\u2019s too many of them. \nOh, I love those signs \u201cBlack for Trump\u201d. Oh, oh, that seems to be, that seems to be the big surprise so far of this election. \nThank you, fellas. That\u2019s so great. Thank you. That is great. Thank you. Thank you very much. That\u2019s a great honor. Believe me, that\u2019s a great honor. \nSo, they kept saying the great state of Texas is in play. \nNow, you know it\u2019s supposed to be sort of a Republican stronghold, not supposed to be in play. \nBut I said, \u201cOh man\u201d. I called my people. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Texas?\u201d Because I was just there. We had a crowd 20,000, 22,000, 15,000. Every time I went. We had these massive crowds. \nThey had a line that went so long that local media is much more honest then these dishonest guys. \nThe local media, and they were showing the line went all the way and literally it went miles. \nSo, then I get back and three weeks ago, \u201cTexas is in play. It\u2019s even\u201d. \nAnd I said that\u2019s bad news. Man, I don\u2019t want to lose Texas. That\u2019s bad news. \nOne little problem. One little problem. We\u2019re killing them in Texas. We\u2019re killing them. \nA guy gets on two days ago. A man named Sid Miller [sp], don\u2019t really know him, wearing a big beautiful white cowboy hat. In fact, I want to find out where he got it. It\u2019s pretty nice. \nAnd he said, you know, you folks, you\u2019re giving it all wrong. These lines are four, five, six blocks long. We\u2019ve never had anything like this in Texas. And let me tell, you all those folks, they\u2019re all voting for Trump. They\u2019re not voting for anyone else. \nSo, Texas, we\u2019re, we\u2019re just, we are absolutely doing great in Texas. \nBut we\u2019re doing great in New Hampshire. We\u2019re doing great in Iowa. We\u2019re doing great in Ohio. \n...People maybe 4,000 outside, should we wait for them to come in? I agree. Let\u2019s get going. \nYou people were there from like two in the morning, they tell me. So, we\u2019re going to get going. \nThank you very much. And we don\u2019t need Jay Z to fill up arenas. You know, we do it the old fashion way. We do it the old fashion way, folks. We fill them up because you love what we\u2019re saying and you want to make America great again. That\u2019s about it. \nAnd I actually like Jay Z, but you know the language last night, oh. Ohh. \nI was thinking maybe I\u2019ll just try it. Should I use that language from one of them? \nCan you imagine if I said that? \nSo, if he used every word in the book. I won\u2019t even use the initials because I\u2019ll get in trouble. They\u2019ll get me in trouble. \nHe used every word in the book last night. \nAnd by the way, in Hershey, Pennsylvania, last night, we had an arena. We had 27,000 people show up. Maybe they couldn\u2019t get in. \nFar more than Jay Z had with their free tickets. Free tickets. Far more. And Beyonce. \nAnd I like them both. \nBut he used language last night that was so bad. And then Hillary Clinton said, I did not like Donald Trump\u2019s lewd language. My lewd language. \nI\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ve never said what he said in my life. \nBut that shows you the phoniness of politicians and the phoniness of the whole system, folks. \nIn three days, we are going to win the great state of Florida, and we are going to win back the White House. \nReal change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. \nIt\u2019s just been announced that the residents of Florida, I\u2019m sorry to tell you this, are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike. And I know what it is. \nI say this to everybody. I just don\u2019t\u2019 want to destroy the spirit in the room. It\u2019s going to be a massive hike. So, congratulations. \nIt\u2019s not going to matter because if we win, I\u2019m throwing it out anyway so it doesn\u2019t make a difference. \nBut get ready. You\u2019re going to have a big, big, big hike. Hopefully, it won\u2019t make a damn bit of difference. \nIn the great state of Arizona, where I was just a couple days ago, where I\u2019m going, premiums are going up by more than 116%. They\u2019re going to go higher than that. \nOver 90% of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurer. And think of it, they\u2019re losing their insurers. Over 90% of the counties. \nAnd remember, and most of you were there, almost all of you felt this whole movement right from the beginning when we came down for the primaries. Right? \nWe won 66 out of 67 counties. 66 out of 67. Florida is just a place I love. My second home. I\u2019m here all the time. \nI might know Florida better than you do. But it\u2019s my second home. But we won 66 out of 67 counties. That\u2019s never happened before. \nWe almost won that last one too. \nAnd I see maybe even more enthusiasm right now than I did then. I think there\u2019s more enthusiasm. \nYou see the tremendous lines of people and they have Trump hats on, Make America Great Again, but they have Trump hats on. And they have buttons, they have shirts, they\u2019re in line. \nAnd you see NBC and you see these people, total phonies. The most dishonest people. And they\u2019ll say, it looks like it\u2019s going. There was like one line was like 100% Trump brigade. No, maybe they\u2019re in disguise. Maybe they\u2019re wearing button, shirts, and Trump hats but they\u2019re actually going to vote for crooked Hillary. Do you think that\u2019s possible? \nBut you see these lines and the woman says, yes, I\u2019d say it\u2019s very evenly based.

We will make this country greater than ever before. We\u2019ll have more jobs. We\u2019ll have more of everything. \nWe were discussing disease. We were discussing all sorts of things tonight \u2013 many of which will just be words. It\u2019ll just pass on. \nI don\u2019t want to say politicians all talk, no action, but a lot of what we talked about is words and it\u2019ll be forgotten very quickly. \nIf I\u2019m President, many of the things that we discussed tonight will not be forgotten. \nWe\u2019ll find solutions and the world will respect us. They will respect us like never before. \nAnd it will actually be a friendlier world. \nAnd I have to say it\u2019s a great honor to be here tonight. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Colorado Springs", "text": "Can you imagine General Douglas MacArthur saying at a news conference, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a very good question, Jim. We\u2019re going to hit them from the front on Oct. 7th at 3:00 in the afternoon and then we\u2019re going to attack them from the back if we do well from the front. But by that time, the front is so well fortified, we may not do as well.\u201d \nCan you imagine these people? \nI will give you good results. Don\u2019t worry how I get there, okay? Please. \nWe had a clown today. An absolute clown. Robert Gates. He\u2019s supposed to be an expert. He\u2019s been there forever. \nBy the way, he writes a book. He says bad about everybody that he\u2019s worked for. He\u2019s been there for a long time. Everybody that he\u2019s worked for he\u2019s got. He\u2019s a nasty guy. Probably has some problem that we don\u2019t know about. But he\u2019s a nasty guy and he spoke badly about Bush. He spoke badly about Obama. He speaks badly about everybody. \nNever met the guy. Never saw him. I saw him on television. Didn\u2019t like him. The end result of this is look where we are. He\u2019s a mess. Okay? He\u2019s a mess. \nSo he goes out and says negative things about me. I never met him. I never talked to him. \nBelieve me. I am so much better at what he\u2019s doing than he is. You won\u2019t even believe it. \nLook at what he gave us. Look at the mess of all the these people that have been there for so many years. \nLook at what we have. Look at the Middle East. \nIf we never touched them, we would\u2019ve been a hell of lot better of than we are right now. What a shame. All of that the money but most importantly, the blood, the death. \nAnd what do we have now? We\u2019re in worse shape than we were 15 years ago by a factor of 10. And we\u2019ve spent $6 trillion. $6 trillion. That seems to be the new number. $6 trillion. \nMuch more importantly, the lives that we\u2019ve lost because we\u2019re dealing with incompetent people. We\u2019re dealing with stupid people. We\u2019re dealing with people like Robert Gates that don\u2019t have clue. And then when they leave office, they criticize everybody. \nI don\u2019t like critics. I don\u2019t like critics. I like the people that get it done and get it done right. \nWe need to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous future. We can do that. \nJobs will return. Incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores. That\u2019s what we have to have. \nOnce more, we will have a government of, by, and for the people. \nWe will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. \nThank you. I love you. Thank you, Colorado. God bless you. God bless you. Thank you, Colorado. \nNov. 8th. Nov. 8th. Thank you. Thank you. \nThis is unacceptable. \nTo the Hispanic community, I say, we are going to protect your jobs. We are going to build up your schools. And we are going to deliver safety and opportunity to your children, and you deserve it. \nEarlier this week, along with my daughter Ivanka, I also wrote \u2013 she has a great heart, that I wrote down here \u2013 I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable child care. \nA married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill. \nA married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in your tax bill. \nMillions of low income people will be removed from the tax rolls entirely. \nA Trump administration will deliver every American 3 things: A great economy, a safe country and an honest government, free of corruption. \nWe are going to get rid of it. I am going to reduce taxes. We are going to reduce taxes. \nAnd by the way, Hillary Clinton is going to raise your taxes very very substantially. \nWe are going to reduce taxes, eliminate horrible regulations, unleash American energy, appoint the great judges, save the Second Amendment, reduce crime, create school choice, end illegal immigration, and renegotiate our terrible trade deals to put Americans back to work and to put Americans first. \nWe will rebuild our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our highways, airports, schools and hospitals. \nAmerican cars will travel the roads. American planes will soar the skies. And American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds and that includes Denver. They have some very nice skyscrapers. \nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation. And American energy mined from American sources will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. \nWe will put new American steel into the spine of our country. \nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation, and I will fight to bring us all together united in common purpose and common dreams. \nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag. \nIt\u2019s time to break with the bitter failures of the past. It\u2019s time to just, we have to break, we have to break with those failures. We have so many failures. \nYou know, think of it, we don\u2019t win anymore folks. Where do we win? We don\u2019t win. \nWe don\u2019t win with crime. We don\u2019t win with schools. We don\u2019t win with trade. Our military is depleted. Our vets aren\u2019t being treated properly. We are going to treat our vets properly. \nWe lose with health care. We don\u2019t win anymore. We don\u2019t win. \nOur military can\u2019t beat ISIS. \nCan you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur or the great General George Patton saying we can\u2019t beat ISIS? \nPatton would rip your heart out if you ever said that. We can\u2019t beat them. Can you imagine that though? Can you imagine what they? They are watching right now. They are spinning in their graves. \nAnd so often they\u2019ll ask me, how do you defeat ISIS? I said, \u201cYou know what? I have a real chance of winning. I don\u2019t want to tell the enemy how I am thinking.\u201d \nDoes that make sense? \nThe only people she delivers for are her donors. I\u2019m going to deliver for the American people, I promise you that. \nAnd I\u2019m spending my money on this race. I\u2019m spending my money. I\u2019ve got a lot of time, energy, and my money invested. That\u2019s for sure. \nSo that includes lifting the restrictions \u2013 we have to do this \u2013 on American energy. There\u2019s $50 trillion of untapped energy reserves in our country, and we\u2019re going to unlock that vast potential. \nThat\u2019s going to be an amazing unlocking, too, believe me. \nThis one action alone will raise the quality of life for tens of millions of Americans. \nWe\u2019ll be a rich country again. We\u2019ll start paying off our debt. We\u2019ll lower your taxes. It\u2019s going to be a very beautiful thing to watch. \nWe\u2019re also going to complete reform our trade deals. \nFord, Ford Motor Company, just announced they\u2019re moving all of their small car division. They\u2019re moving. Where are they moving? They\u2019re moving to Mexico. This won\u2019t happen if I\u2019m elected President, believe me. \nPeople are not going to be stealing our companies, and we\u2019re not going to be losing our jobs. \nAnd if somebody like Ford or Carrier or all of these thousands of companies that are moving. If they think they\u2019re going to move, fire all of their employees, so we get unemployment or we get no tax. They\u2019re going to make product and brand new plants in another country, sell it into our country against \u2013 and remember this, it will now be crossing a very very strong border. Very strong. We\u2019re going to charge them a 35% tax on their product. \nAnd you know what they\u2019re going to say? They\u2019re going to say, \u201cWe\u2019re not moving because if we have to do that, it no longer makes sense to move.\u201d \nAnd the politicians could have done it. They could have done it. They don\u2019t want to do it because they\u2019re controlled by special interests, folks. It\u2019s very simple. \nMeanwhile, if we just stopped China from stealing our intellectual property alone, we\u2019d save two million jobs a year. We don\u2019t even talk to China about it. \nRight now, our trade deficit in goods all over the world is nearly $800 billion a year. Think of it. Who makes these deals? Who makes these deals? \nWe have a trade deficit of $800 billion a year. And then they say I\u2019m against trade. Well, I\u2019m against deals like that, I can tell you. You\u2019re better off without them. \nThis subtracts from our GDP. Our economy grew only 1.1% in the last quarter, and that\u2019s a catastrophe. \nIf China goes down to 7 or 8 % it\u2019s like a national emergency. We have 1.1%. It\u2019s pathetic. \nThis is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Another 14 million people have left the workforce and, entirely, it all came in entirely, since President Obama came into office. \nAnother major reform is going to be school choice. \nI\u2019ve outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America to chose the private, public, magnate, or religious school of his or her choice. \nFor those of you who believe in education, like I do, this will help lift millions of African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty. \nSince President Obama came into office, another two million Hispanic Americans have fallen into poverty. \nAnd remember the $400 million in cash? Well, that turned out to be wrong! I\u2019m sorry. It turned out to be $1.7 billion in cash. \nNow can you imagine, can you imagine the scene of $1.7 billion in cash, different denominations...I mean the whole thing is so...it wasn\u2019t $400 million, it was 1.7 billion! \nWho does this? Where are these people coming from? \nAnd now, you look at Iran, and they\u2019re emboldened. They want to shoot down our airplanes. \nYou see with the little boats going around our ships. You see that? And taunting, they\u2019re taunting. They feel emboldened after all of this. \nOh boy, oh boy, oh boy. It\u2019s gonna be so different folks, I promise. \nCan you imagine the captain on the destroyer as they keep circling with their little boats? He wants to shoot them out of the water so bad. He was standing there like this, just looking, just looking saying \u201cWhat is going on? Where have we \u2013 where have we come and gone?\u201d \nISIS is spreading everywhere and launching attacks against the West. \nHer judgment on the economy is no better. \nHillary\u2019s donors and advisers are the same people who gave us NAFTA \u2013 the worst trade deal in the history \u2013 not of our country \u2013 in the history of our world. There has never been a trade deal as bad as NAFTA anywhere in the world. \nYou look at upstate New York. You look at New England. You look at Colorado. You look at the manufacturing that\u2019s been ripped out of Ohio and Pennsylvania and everywhere. And it\u2019s gone to Mexico and other places. \nAnd I tell this story because I have a friend \u2013 better than a consultant, he cost me nothing. He is a great guy. He builds plants. And I said to him, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d And he said, \u201cI\u2019m doing unbelievably. We\u2019re building the greatest plants in the world.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d He said \u201cMexico\u201d. \u201cWhat about our country?\u201d \u201cNot so much.\u201d \nOkay? It\u2019s gonna change folks. It\u2019s gonna go the opposite. Believe me. \nThey allowed China the entry into the World Trade Organization. You see where that got us. \nAnd now she wants to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. This will be...she called it the gold standard. This will be a disaster. \nHer policies have produced suffering everywhere, but especially in our inner cities. \n45% of African-Americans under the age six are living in poverty. \n58% of African-American youth are not employed. \nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in the city of Chicago since Jan. 1st. \nCan you imagine? \nBy the way, by the way, that\u2019s worse than Afghanistan. That\u2019s worse than these war-torn countries! It\u2019s more dangerous. \nThe jobs are gone. The schools are failing. The communities are totally unsafe. \nAnd to the African Americans living in those communities, I say vote for Donald Trump. What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? \nI will fix it. I will fix it. I\u2019ll bring back your jobs and your security, and I\u2019ll fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought before. \nThese cities have been run by the policies of Hillary Clinton and her friends. And I\u2019m telling you, they\u2019re only getting worse. They\u2019re getting worse every time. \nShe wants your vote and then she said \u201cSee you, like, in four years.\u201d But hopefully, we\u2019re not gonna be worrying about that. \nIt is really sad. It is really sad what\u2019s happened to our inner cities. They want your vote, and by the way, the Democrats have run them for 50, 60, 70, even 100 years! Uninterrupted. 100 years, and look what you have. \nI will fix it, remember that. I will fix it. What do you have to lose? \nSomebody said, oh that\u2019s not a nice thing, what do you have to lose. How could you be any more accurate than that? What do you have to lose? \nEverywhere she goes, scandal and failure follow. \nJust look at what she did in upstate New York. She promised 200,000 jobs and they ended up losing jobs. Remember? She was running for the Senate. It was a total disaster. She said we\u2019re gonna bring jobs back. It was a total...she didn\u2019t bring anything, we lost jobs! \nIs there any place that\u2019s more fun to be \u2013 and look at this, I mean, how beautiful is this than a Trump rally. No place safer\u2013 and there\u2019s no place safer, that I can tell you. A lot of love. There\u2019s a lot of love. \nI just want to tell you this, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, it\u2019s Nov. 8th, if we win \u2014 not me, we win\u2013 I\u2019m the messenger, I\u2019m doing a good job as the messenger, but I\u2019m\u2013 \nBut we all know what has to be done, and we are going to do something special. \nAnd I promise you this: I will never ever let you down. You\u2019re not going to be let down. Not going to be let down. \nOur support comes from all regions, all backgrounds, and all walks of life. \nYou\u2019re the brick layers, and the home builders, and the doctors, and the dentists, and the carpenters, and the welders. Young and old; rich and poor; black, white, Hispanic, but above all else, we\u2019re Americans, and that\u2019s the support. We\u2019re Americans. \nSo you\u2019ve heard this word, and while my opponent, Hillary Clinton, oy\u2013 How many years have we been saying this name? \nYou know, I keep hearing that she wants to do this, she wants to do that\u2013 where has she been for 35 years? She\u2019s been doing this. Where has she been? \nMy opponent slanders you as deplorable, and a word that hasn\u2019t been picked up to the same extent: irredeemable. What means you can\u2019t be made better, or whatever. That means you\u2019re always gonna be deplorable, right? I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. \nI call you hard-working American patriots, who love your family and love your country, and you want to see it be better. \nHillary Clinton\u2019s comments\u2013 and they were angry comments\u2013 Did you see her making this? I was watching\u2013 I was starting to fall asleep watching, because it\u2019s hard to stay awake, let\u2019s face it. So I\u2019m starting to doze off, and then I heard the word deplorable and I said \u2018whoa!\u2019. And irredeemable. \nThink of it. But her comments display the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete 33,000 emails. \nThink of it, 33,000. But it really had to do with yoga and the wedding. \nSo what do we do? We give yoga 5 and the wedding 3, where are the rest of them? Destroy her phones \u2014 and think of this \u2014 with a hammer. Boom. 13 of them. Put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access \u2014 just sells government favors and access. \nIt\u2019s the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disaster she created in the Middle East. What you\u2019re seeing is largely a creation of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. \nBefore she came into office, Libya was stable; Syria was under control, right? You just said it. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence, and Iran was being totally choked off by sanctions \u2014 they were not, they were not gonna make it. \nThe group we, today \u2014 and you see it \u2014 today we call ISIS, this is the group that was formed \u2014 we call ISIS \u2014 and it was close to being extinguished. \nNow, after Hillary, here\u2019s what we have: Libya, Syria, and Iraq are in total chaos; Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons and is becoming, not a local power but a world power, so fast\u2013 how fast has this taken? They were dying two years ago. Look what\u2019s happened. \nIf you\u2019re feeling horrible, just horrible, if you\u2019re sick, you\u2019re really sick. You can\u2019t get out of bed. I don\u2019t give a you know what. Because if I use that word they\u2019ll say, \u201cHe used foul language. It is terrible.\u201d So I won\u2019t even use that word, that starts with a D, right? You know. Not so bad. \nI don\u2019t even like using the H word, you know. The place that\u2019s down there. Because if I use that word they\u2019ll say, \u201cHe used foul language.\u201d \nSee? I\u2019ve learned. It\u2019s been a process. I\u2019ve learned. \nBut that\u2019s why I\u2019m so proud to have the endorsement of the people who actually, on the ground, they\u2019re on the ground. They know what needs to be done. Not the insiders from Washington, D.C. They know what has to be done, too, but they\u2019ll never to it because they\u2019re working for themselves. \nI see a mosquito. Right now, I don\u2019t like mosquitos too much, folks. Get out of here you mosquito. I never minded mosquitos. Now, I\u2019m not loving them, I must be honest. \nThis week I was honored to get the endorsement of 17 recipients of the Medal of Honor and many many of our incredible military leaders. \nWe now have the endorsement of more than 160 top generals and admirals. That\u2019s a lot. \nWe also have the support and endorsement of 16,500 border patrol agents. First time they\u2019ve ever endorsed a presidential candidate. \nEarlier today, I had a chance to spend some time with victims of illegal immigrant violence. And this is violence. \nThese are great people of all races and all background. They\u2019re all united by one common fact: their government failed them in its most basic duty. \nThey just \u2013 and I have to tell you, it was so sad and maybe some of you saw it today, it was on television \u2013 but, we received the endorsement of the nation\u2019s largest police fraternal order. It\u2019s called the Fraternal Order of Police. And we talked about it this morning. \nIf you would see these people, who lost their daughters, their sons, their husbands, their wives, to the most violent people, the most violent people, you would say that when I first came out, and I started talking about trade deals and I started talking about energy, but I started talking about illegal immigration, you would say, \u201cBoy oh boy was he right about that.\u201d \nAnd we\u2019re going to stop the crime. We\u2019re going to stop the drugs from pouring across our border and poisoning our youth. And you have the same problem right here. We\u2019re going to stop that problem. \nNot only our youth, by the way. Many, many people are being poisoned by what\u2019s pouring across that border. So we\u2019re going to stop it and we\u2019re going to stop it cold. \nLast night in Fort Worth, Texas, a newly commissioned officer in training and his field officer were shot while responding to a possible suicide. \nAlso last night, in Philadelphia, a 19 year police veteran was shot eight times. The police commissioner said it was a miracle that she wasn\u2019t killed. She. \nAlso, another officer, who formerly served for 33 years in the Philadelphia police department was shot numerous times. \nOur prayers are with all of the victims. We must stand with our police. We must. \nAnd I\u2019m so greatly honored to have the support of our local law enforcement and all law enforcement. We have such incredible law enforcement support. \nOur men and women in military uniform \u2013 unbelievable support. And the support of firefighters. Paramedics. And so many other public servants. We have got support. \nI\u2019ll tell you what, folks, I\u2019m looking and I\u2019m seeing every place we go we have crowds like this. Every place. \nWe just left \u2013 we were in Texas, we were in Oklahoma. Every place we go we\u2019re having crowds like this. \nThere\u2019s something special going on. We\u2019re going to take back the White House. We\u2019re going to take back our country. \nAnd you see what\u2019s happening. You see what\u2019s happening. \nI mean, look at the numbers. Look at what\u2019s happening with your premiums. They\u2019re going through the roof. Up 20 30 40 50%. \nYour deductibles are so high, you\u2019ll never get to use them unless you really, oh, I don\u2019t even like to say it. It\u2019s going to be a long, slow, tragic death. And then maybe you\u2019ll get to use a little tiny piece, but that\u2019s going to be the last thing you\u2019re worried about. Believe me. \nWe\u2019re going to appoint Supreme Court justices who uphold the Constitution of the United States. So important. \nWe\u2019re going to work with law enforcement, our police, to stop the surge of violent crime. \nWe\u2019re going to revitalize our crumbling infrastructure. \nWe\u2019re going to provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America of which we have many. \nAnd we\u2019re going, by the way, to end Common Core. We\u2019re bringing our education local. \nWe\u2019re going to end illegal immigration, and yes, we will build a wall. We\u2019re going to build the wall. \nAnd you know what? They don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re starting to get the idea. And they\u2019re great people and they\u2019re very good leaders. Much smarter than our leaders, believe me. But Mexico will be paying for that wall, okay? They will be paying. We know. \nWe\u2019re going to keep the terrorists out of our country and apply new screening standards. 100%. To admit people that love our country and want to love our country and people that want to love our people. We\u2019re going to defeat ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism. \nWe\u2019re going to rebuild our badly depleted military. They\u2019re the greatest people on Earth. But we got to build. We have to rebuild our military. It\u2019s depleted. \nOur fighters are 18-years-old in some cases. They go out to replace parts. They go to the Aeroplane graveyards to get parts because they don\u2019t make them anymore. They go to museums to take parts off planes. These are fighter jets that we have right now. You\u2019ve seen it. \nIt is terrible. This is not the United States of America, folks. \nAnd we\u2019re going to remember those three very famous words: Peace through strength. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to have. \nAnd hopefully we won\u2019t have to use our strength so much, but we need it. Maybe more than ever before. \nIn all things, it\u2019s going to be America first. America first. You don\u2019t hear that anymore. You don\u2019t hear that anymore. \nYou go out and you see these trade deals that it looks like we\u2019re doing the deals for other countries. \nCorrect. Correct. Correct. That is so correct. \nIn this mission, we are going to campaign in every community in our country. \nThis is our chance to replace a failed, corrupt, and dishonest political establishment with a new government that answers to the citizens, not to the special interests. \nWe can\u2019t keep listening to the same people who created all of these problems in the first place. \nBy the way, Hillary Clinton, we\u2019re not going to listen and we\u2019re not going to take it anymore. We\u2019re going to do what we know we have to do. \nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m proud and, by the way, when you say that. Let\u2019s just win on Nov. 8th, okay? It\u2019s so simple. Get out, vote, bring everybody. \nThank you everybody, wow. This is great in a hangar, yet, right? In a hangar, boy, oh boy. \nIt\u2019s a movement like they haven\u2019t seen before. \nI must tell you that just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what\u2019s going on. But boy, we are living in a time. We better get very tough folks, we better get very, very tough. Just happened. So we\u2019ll find out but it\u2019s a terrible thing that\u2019s going on in our world, in our country, and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant. And we\u2019re going to end it. We\u2019re going to end it. So we\u2019ll see what it is. We\u2019ll see what it is. \nIn any event, I am so thrilled to be in Colorado \u2013 a special place, special, special place. Really special place. \nA new poll from Emerson just came out and we\u2019re up four points in Colorado, right? And we haven\u2019t spent any money on advertising yet. That\u2019s even better. \nYou know, in the old days, if you could be up and have a smaller crew and spend no money, you were considered a genius. \nToday, if you don\u2019t spend a lot of money and don\u2019t have a big crew, they say, \u201cOh, he\u2019s not spending a lot of money\u201d. \nBut we\u2019re going to spend a lot of money in Colorado because we\u2019re going to take Colorado. We don\u2019t want to take any chances, alright? We don\u2019t want to take any chances. \nSo, Reuters has just projected a win for us in Florida. We\u2019re going to win in Florida. \nAnd we\u2019re up in Ohio and we\u2019re up in Iowa. We\u2019re up eight points in Iowa. We\u2019re up four or five points in Ohio and amazing people. \nYou look at what\u2019s going on with our manufacturing being sucked out of our country; we\u2019re not gonna be having have that happen long, folks. Not going to happen for long, believe me. \nWe\u2019re up in North Carolina. We\u2019re up in many, many polls nationwide. \nThe Los Angeles Times has up six points nationwide so we\u2019re good. We\u2019re good. \nIn other words, I think we\u2019re going to win is what I\u2019m saying, right? \nYou know they call this a movement, and all over, they\u2019re talking about it as a movement. \nBill O\u2019Reilly said one of the great phenomenas he\u2019s ever seen. He\u2019s actually said it\u2019s the greatest political phenomena he\u2019s seen in his lifetime. \nBut I\u2019ll tell you something, it doesn\u2019t mean anything if we don\u2019t win. We gotta win. We gotta win. \nIt\u2019s going to be a victory for the people. It\u2019s going to be a victory for you all the way in that corner over there. Boy, we have a lot of people here. This is a big hangar and it\u2019s full. Big hangar, and I appreciate it. \nStarting in 2017, anything we dream for our country will be achieved. It\u2019s going to be achieved. \nIt\u2019s time to start thinking of dreaming big. We don\u2019t dream big anymore in this country. Bigger than all of those petty politicians that don\u2019t have a clue, believe me. \nOur plan begins with economic prosperity. \nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words. You know what they are? Jobs, jobs, jobs. \nWe\u2019re going to have a massive tax reduction \u2013 big, big league tax reduction for working and middle class families. \nWe\u2019re going to reduce \u2013 and this is so important \u2013 reduce job-killing regulations and raise your incomes way up high. \nWe\u2019re going to keep our good jobs. We have bad jobs. We are going to get our good jobs back; they\u2019ve been sucked away. We\u2019re going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals. \nNow, that doesn\u2019t mean \u2013 you know, these press, they are so dishonest. I\u2019m all for trade but we want good deals. We don\u2019t want bad deals. \nWhen I say I\u2019m going renegotiate, they say Trump\u2019s anti-trade. I\u2019m totally for trade but we\u2019re going to have great deals for our country. \nWe\u2019re going to have job-producing deals, not job-sucking deals, which are getting sucked out of our country. \nWe\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech on immigration policy", "text": "Parent:\nI\u2019m Steve Ronnebeck, father of Grant Ronnebeck, 21 years old, killed Jan. 22, 2015 by an illegal immigrant who shot him in the face. I truly believe that Mr. Trump is going to change things. He\u2019s going to fight for my family, and he\u2019s going to fight for America. \nThat\u2019s tough stuff, I will tell you. That is tough stuff. Incredible people. \nSo now is the time for these voices to be heard. \nNow is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf. \nNow is the time for all of us as one country \u2013 Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative \u2013 to band together to deliver justice and safety and security for all Americans. Let\u2019s fix this horrible, horrible problem. It can be fixed quickly. \nLet\u2019s secure our border. \nLet\u2019s stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country. \nLet\u2019s protect our Social Security and Medicare. \nLet\u2019s get unemployed Americans off of welfare and back to work in their own country. \nThis has been an incredible evening. We\u2019re going to remember this evening. \nNov. 8th. We have to get everybody \u2013 this is such an important state. Nov. 8th. We have to get everybody to go out and vote. \nWe\u2019re going to bring \u2013 thank you. Thank you. We\u2019re going to take our country back, folks. This is a movement. We\u2019re going to take our country back. \nThank you. Thank you. \nThis is an incredible movement. The world is talking about it. The world is talking about it. \nAnd by the way, if you haven\u2019t been looking at what\u2019s been happening at the polls over the last three or four days, I think you should start looking. You should start looking. \nTogether, we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures. \nTogether, we can save America itself. \nJoin me in this mission. We\u2019re going to make America great again. \nThank you! I love you! Thank you. God bless you everybody! God bless you! \nI\u2019ve become friends with so many but Jamiel Shaw, incredible guy. Lost his son so violently. \nSay just a few words about your child. \nAngel Mom:\nMy son, Ronald DeSilva [sp], was murdered April 27, 2002 by an illegal alien who had been previously deported. And what makes me so outraged is that we came here legally. Thank you, Mr. Trump. I totally support you. You have my vote.\u201d \nAngel Mom:\nLaura Wilkerson [sp] and my son was Joshua Wilkerson [sp]. He was murdered by an illegal in 2010 and I personally support Mr. Trump for our next president. \nAngel Mom:\nMy name is Ruth Johnston Martin [sp]. My husband was shot by an illegal alien. He fought the good fight but he took his last breadth in 2002. And I support this man who is going to change this country for the better. God bless you. \nAngel Mom:\nMy name is Maureen Maloney [sp] and our son, Matthew Denice, was 23-years-old when he was dragged a quarter of a mile to his death by an illegal alien while horrified witnesses were banging on a truck trying to stop him. \nFather:\nOur son, Matthew Denice, if Donald Trump were president in 2011, our son Matthew Denice and other Americans would be alive today. \nAngel Mom:\nMy name is Cathy Woods [sp]. My son, Steve, a high school senior 17-years-old went to the beach after a high school football game and a local gang came along \u2013 nine members...And all I can say is they murdered him. And if Mr. Trump had been in office then, the border would have been secured and our children would not be dead today. \nAngel Mom:\nHi. My name is Brenda Sparks [sp] and my son is named Eric Zapata [sp]. He was raised by a legal immigrant from Honduras only to be murdered by an illegal in 2011. His murderer never did a second in handcuffs or jail. Got away with killing an American. So I\u2019m voting for Trump, and by the way, so is my mother. \nAngel Mom:\nMy name is Dee Engel [sp]. My cousin, Rebecca Ann Johnston [sp], known as Becky, was murdered on Jan. 1, 1989 in North Little Rock, Arkansas. Thank you and if you don\u2019t vote Trump we won\u2019t have a country. Trump all the way. \nAngel Mom:\nI\u2019m Shannon Estes [sp]. My daughter, Shayley Estes [sp], 22 years old was murdered here in Phoenix last July 24th by a Russian who overstayed his visa. And vote Trump. \nAngel Mom:\nI\u2019m Mary Anne Mendoza, the mother of Sergeant Brandon Mendoza who was killed in a violent head-on collision May 12, 2014 in Mesa. Thank you. And I want to thank Phoenix for the support you\u2019ve always given me. And I want to tell you what I\u2019m supporting the man who will \u2013 who is the only man who\u2019s going to save our country and what we are going to be leaving our children. \nImportantly, in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time and at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government. \nAnd the establishment of our new lawful immigration system, then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain. \nThat discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time. \nRight now, however, we are in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis, and a terrorism crisis like never before. \nAll energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time. Immigration security. Cut it off. \nWhether it\u2019s dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas, or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing and the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton\u2019s answer on her policies will affect Americans and their security. \nThese are matters of life and death for our country and its people and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton. \nAnd do you notice she doesn\u2019t answer. She didn\u2019t go to Louisiana. She didn\u2019t go to Mexico. She was invited. \nShe doesn\u2019t have the strength or the stamina to make America great again. Believe me. \nWhat we do know despite the lack of media curiosity is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton. You won\u2019t like what you\u2019re hearing. \nThe result will be millions more illegal immigrants, thousands of more violent horrible crimes, and total chaos and lawlessness. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen as sure as you\u2019re standing there. \nThis election and I believe this is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws to make your life better. I really believe this is it. This is our last time. Nov. 8th. Nov. 8th. You\u2019ve got to get out and vote on Nov. 8th. It\u2019s our last chance. It\u2019s our last chance and that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment. Remember that. \nSo I want to remind everyone what we\u2019re fighting for and who we are fighting for. I am going to ask \u2013 these are really special people that I\u2019ve gotten to know. I am going to ask all of the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now. These are amazing women. These are amazing people. \nAnd just look at the past. She\u2019s done nothing. She\u2019s been there for 35 years. She\u2019s done nothing. \nAnd I\u2019d say, \u201cWhat do you have to lose? Choose me. Watch how good we\u2019re going to do together. Watch.\u201d \nYou watch. \nWe want people to come into our country but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted and in a manner that serves the national interest. \nWe\u2019ve been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They\u2019re decades and decades old. \nTo avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date. They\u2019re archaic. They\u2019re ancient. \nWe wouldn\u2019t put our entire federal budget on autopilot for decades so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration? \nSo let\u2019s now talk about the big picture. \nThese 10 steps, if vigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen folks. \nBecause I am proudly not a politician, because I am not beholden to any special interests, I\u2019ve spent a lot of money on my campaign I\u2019ll tell you. I write those checks. Nobody owns Trump. \nI will get this done for you and your family. We\u2019ll do it right. You\u2019ll be proud of our country again. We\u2019ll do it right. \nWe will accomplish all of the steps outlined above, and when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. \nCrime will go down. Border crossings will plummet. Gangs will disappear and the gangs are all over the place. And welfare use will decrease. \nWe will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We\u2019re going to rebuild them for once and for all. \nFor those here illegally today who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only \u2013 to return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. \nThose who have left to seek entry under this new system \u2013 and it will be an efficient system \u2013 will not be awarded surplus visas but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future. \nWe will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty. \nOur message to the world will be this: You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. Can\u2019t do it. \nThis declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays very importantly. \nPeople will know that you can\u2019t just smuggle in, hunker down, and wait to be legalized. Not going to work that way. Those days are over. \nThe Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62% of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance. Tremendous cost, by the way, to our country. Tremendous cost. \nThis directly violates the federal-public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury. Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal. \nNumber 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers \u2013 the forgotten people, workers. We\u2019re going to take care of our workers. \nAnd by the way, we\u2019re going to make great trade deals. We\u2019re going to renegotiate trade deals. We\u2019re going to bring our jobs back home. We\u2019re going to bring our jobs back home. We have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world and that starts with NAFTA. And now they want to go TPP \u2013 one of the great disasters. \nWe\u2019re going to bring our jobs back home and if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states, there\u2019s going to be a lot of trouble for them. It\u2019s not going to be so easy. There will be consequence. Remember that. There will be consequence. \nThey\u2019re not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it into the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It\u2019s not going to happen. There will be consequences. \nWe\u2019ve admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. So true. But we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we have following \u2013 if you think \u2013 previous immigration waves. We\u2019ve had some big waves and tremendously positive things have happened. Incredible things have happened. \nTo ensure assimilation. We want to ensure that it works. Assimilation \u2013 an important word. Integration and upward mobility. \nWithin just a few years, immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. \nThe time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals to keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms, to select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society, and their ability to be financially self-sufficient. \nWe take in anybody. Come on in anybody. Just come on in. Not any more. \nYou know, folks, it\u2019s called a two-way street. It is a two-way street. Right? \nWe need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others. \nRemember, under a Trump administration, it\u2019s called America First. Remember that. \nTo choose immigrants based on merit \u2013 merit \u2013 skill, and proficiency. Doesn\u2019t that sound nice? \nAnd to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first and that in particular African-American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly. \nAnd Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African-American worker, the Latino worker. She\u2019s going to do nothing. Give me your vote she says on Nov. 8th and then she\u2019ll say, \u201cSo long. See you in four years.\u201d That\u2019s what it is. She is going to do nothing. \nAccording to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not under any circumstances take them back. \nHard to believe with the power we have. Hard to believe. We\u2019re like the big bully that keeps getting beat up. Do you ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up. \nThese 13,000 releases occur on Hillary Clinton\u2019s watch. She had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she decided she would not do it. \nAnd Arizona knows better than most exactly what I\u2019m talking about. \nThose released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable. \nThe Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30% committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation. We take them. We take them. \nNumber eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system, which we need desperately. \nFor years, Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action. Never happens. Never happens. \nHillary Clinton \u2013 all talk. Unfortunately, when there is action, it\u2019s always the wrong decision. Do you ever notice? \nIn my administration, we will ensure that this system is in place. And I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system. \nApproximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never ever left. Why should they? Nobody\u2019s telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want. We\u2019ll take care of you. \nBeyond violating our laws, visa overstays pose \u2013 and they really are a big problem \u2013 pose a substantial threat to national security. \nThe 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the United States on expired visas. And you know what that would have meant. What that could have meant. Wouldn\u2019t that have been wonderful, right? What that could have meant. \nLast year alone, nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing visa overstays will be a top priority of my administration. \nIf people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never ever leave, the Obama-Clinton policy \u2013 that\u2019s what it is \u2013 then we have a completely open border and we no longer have a country. \nWe must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced. \nNumber nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet. We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country. \nImmigration law doesn\u2019t exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out. It exists to protect all aspects of American life \u2013 the work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else. That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. \nIf we only enforce the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world. We will enforce all of our immigration laws. \nAnd the same goes for government benefits. \nCountries from which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. \nAnd we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria. We have no idea who they are, where they come from. There\u2019s no documentation. There\u2019s no paperwork. It\u2019s going to end badly, folks. It\u2019s going to end very, very badly. \nFor the price of resettling one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region, which I agree with 100%. We have to build safe zones. And we\u2019ll get the money from the Gulf States. \nWe don\u2019t want to put up the money. We owe almost $20 trillion. Double since Obama took office our national debt. \nBut we will get the money from Gulf States and others. We\u2019ll supervise it. We\u2019ll build safe zones, which is something that I think all of us want to see. \nAnother reform involves new screening tests for all applicants. That include \u2013 and this is so important especially if you get the right people and we will get the right people \u2013 an ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people. \nThank you. We\u2019re very proud of our country. Aren\u2019t we? \nWith all it\u2019s going through, we\u2019re very proud of our country. \nFor instance, in the last five years, we\u2019ve admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan and these two countries, according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. That\u2019s what they say. That\u2019s what they say \u2013 they\u2019re justified. Right? And we\u2019re admitting them to our country. \nApplicants will be asked about their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities, attitudes on radical Islam, which our president refuses to say, and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure. \nAnd if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks. Hopefully none. \nNumber seven, we will ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported. \nThere are at least 23 countries that refused to take their people back after they\u2019ve been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals. They won\u2019t take them back so we say, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll keep them.\u201d Not going to happen with me, folks. Not going to happen with me. \nDue to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities. \nAnd by the way, the results are horrific. Horrific. \nThere are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick\u2019s tragic death in Connecticut just last year. \nYet, despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries, Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And they would comply if we would act properly. In other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don\u2019t. \nThe result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead we have them all over the place. Probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact. But I hope not. \nClinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country. A disaster in so many other ways. \nAnd don\u2019t forget the Supreme Court of the United States. Don\u2019t forget that when you go to vote on Nov. 8th. \nAnd don\u2019t forget your Second Amendment. \nAnd don\u2019t forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. \nAnd don\u2019t forget building up our depleted military. \nAnd don\u2019t forget taking care of our vets. Don\u2019t forget our vets. They have been forgotten. \nClinton\u2019s plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. \nIn effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment. \nCan you imagine? \nIn a Trump administration, all immigration laws will be enforced. Will be enforced. \nAs with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities but unlike this administration no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. \nAnd ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done. \nAnyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise, we don\u2019t have a country. \nOur enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is, relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who\u2019ve come here under this current corrupt administration. \nNumber six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur. \nAccording to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. \nAnd even right now, the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that we\u2019ve ever had in the history of our country. \nOur country is a mess. We don\u2019t even know what to look for anymore folks. Our country has to straighten out and we have to straighten out fast. \nThe number is likely higher, but the administration refuses to provide this information even to Congress. \nAs soon as I enter office, I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton. Brutalized. Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place. \nI call it extreme vetting. Right? Extreme vetting. I want extreme. It\u2019s going to be so tough. And if somebody comes in, that\u2019s fine. But they\u2019re going to be good. It\u2019s extreme. \nAnd if people don\u2019t like it, we got to have a country, folks. Got to have a country. \nAnother reform I\u2019m proposing is to pass this piece of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant. \nThe Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly identified and removed. And they will go fast. Believe me, they\u2019re going to go fast. \nWe\u2019re going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers. \nWithin ICE, I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice. Okay? \nMaybe they\u2019ll be able to deport her. \nThe local police who know every one of these criminals and they know each and everyone by name, by crime, where they live. They will work so fast and our local police will be so happy that they don\u2019t have to be abused by these thugs anymore. \nThere\u2019s no great mystery to it. They\u2019ve put up with it for years and now finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess. \nWe\u2019re also going to hire 5,000 more border patrol agents who gave me their endorsement. 16,500 gave me their endorsement. And put more of them on the border instead of behind desks, which is good. \nWe will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly. \nI\u2019ve had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers and I want to take a moment to thank them \u2013 what they do is incredible. \nAnd getting their endorsement means so much to me. More to me really than I can say. Means so much. First time they\u2019ve ever endorsed a presidential candidate. \nNumber four, block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funding. We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. \nCities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities. \nNumber five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws. \nWe will immediately terminate President Obama\u2019s two executive illegal amnesties in which he defied federal law and the constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants. Five million. \nAnd how about all the millions that are waiting on line going through the process legally? So unfair. \nHillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs, including the 2014 amnesty, which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court. Great. \nThey don\u2019t come in here. They don\u2019t come in here. \nAccording to federal data, there are at least 2 million \u2013 2 million, think of it \u2013 criminal aliens now inside of our country. Two million people criminal aliens. \nWe will begin moving them out day one as soon as I take office \u2013 day one \u2013 in joint operations with local, state, and federal law enforcement. \nNow, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect \u2013 say hello to the police. Boy, they don\u2019t get the credit they deserve, I\u2019ll tell you. They\u2019re great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are. They live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can\u2019t do anything about these people and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone. \nAnd you can call it deport if you want. The press doesn\u2019t like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They\u2019re gone. \nBeyond the 2 million and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled but their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They\u2019re going to be gone. It will be over. They\u2019re going out. They\u2019re going out fast. \nMoving forward, we will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that. \nWe will terminate the Obama administration\u2019s deadly \u2013 and it is deadly \u2013 non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do, crime all over the place. That\u2019s over. That\u2019s over, folks. That\u2019s over. \nSince 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn\u2019t have been politically correct. \nMy plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. \nWe will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287 G Partnerships which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don\u2019t even know about. \nBoth of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration and those were programs that worked. \nThis is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction. There\u2019s no common sense. There\u2019s no brain power in our administration by our leader or our leaders. None. None. None. None. \nOn my first day in office, I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate\u2019s Law named for Kate Steinle to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal re-entry receives strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong. And then we\u2019d get them out. \nHard to believe. Hard to believe. \nNow that you\u2019ve heard about Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan about which she has not answered a single question. \nLet me tell you about my plan. And you\u2019d notice all the time for weeks and weeks they\u2019re debating my plan \u2013 debating and talking about it. What about this? What about that? \nThey never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesn\u2019t want to get into the quagmire. It\u2019s a tough one. She doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing except for open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way. \nWhile Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from federal immigration officers \u2013 very great people \u2013 among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country who represent workers not corporations. Very important to us. \nI\u2019ve also worked with lawmakers who\u2019ve led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. \nAnd most importantly, I\u2019ve met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important. \nNumber one, are you ready? Are you ready? We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall. 100%. They don\u2019t know it yet but they\u2019re going to pay for the wall. And they\u2019re great people and great leaders but they\u2019re going to pay for the wall. \nOn day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable, physical tall powerful beautiful southern border wall. \nWe will use the best technology including above and below ground sensors \u2013 that\u2019s the tunnels. Remember that. Above and below. Above and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance, and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels, and keep out criminal cartels. \nAnd Mexico, you know that, will work with us. I really believe it. Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it and especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today, I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us and I\u2019m sure they will. \nNumber two, we are going to end catch and release. We catch them \u2013 \u201cOh, go ahead.\u201d We catch them \u2013 \u201cGo ahead.\u201d \nUnder my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came. \nAnd they\u2019ll be brought great distances. We\u2019re not dropping them off right across. They learned that. President Eisenhower, they\u2019d drop them across right across and they\u2019d come back and across. Then when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. \nWe will take them great distances, but we will take them to the country where they came from. Okay? \nNumber three, number three, this is the one I think it\u2019s so great. It\u2019s hard to believe people don\u2019t even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero! Zero! \nOnly the out-of-touch media elites think the biggest problem facing American \u2013 you know this, you know this. This is what they talk about \u2013 facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don\u2019t have legal status. \nAnd they also think the biggest thing \u2013 and you know this \u2013 it\u2019s not nuclear, it\u2019s not ISIS, it\u2019s not Russia, it\u2019s not China, it\u2019s global warming. \nTo all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate and that issue is the wellbeing of the American people. \nNothing even comes a close second. \nHillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated. But she\u2019s not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder. \nNo, she\u2019s only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. \nWe will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity. So important. We will be fair, just, and compassionate to all. \nBut our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens. \nThank you. President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona. You know it. \nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton supports sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. They support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous criminals from detention. And they support unconstitutional executive amnesty. \nHillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants breaking the federal budget. \nOn top of that, she promises uncontrolled, low skill immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country, our citizens. \nMost incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from. I always say Trojan Horse. Watch what\u2019s going to happen folks. It\u2019s not going to be pretty. \nThis includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. \nAnd even yesterday when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders if we can call them that? What the hell are we doing? \nHe was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary, who had also been released from federal custody. And they knew it was going to happen again. \nAnother victim is Kate Steinle gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times and they knew he was no good. \nThen there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. 90-years-old and defenseless. \nThe perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long who did not meet Obama administration\u2019s standards for removal and they knew it was going to happen. \nIn California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran \u2013 a great woman according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. \nHer killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never ever deported despite the fact that everybody wanted him out. \nA 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names. 25,000. \nOn top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. And this is what we get. \nFor the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide one million at risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting. \nWhile there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn\u2019t change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back and they\u2019re hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances. \nBut these facts are never reported. Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing \u2013 the needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they\u2019re treated better than our vets. \nNot going to happen anymore, folks. Nov. 8th. Not going to happen anymore. \nThe truth is the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be. And honestly, we\u2019ve been hearing that number for years. It\u2019s always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is. \nFrankly, our government has no idea what they\u2019re doing on many, many fronts, folks. \nBut whatever the number that\u2019s never really been the central issue. It will never be a central issue. It doesn\u2019t matter from that standpoint. Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington. \nToday, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. \nThe fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists, and powerful, powerful politicians. It\u2019s all you can do. \nThank you. Thank you. \nLet me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you, the American people. It doesn\u2019t serve you. \nWhen politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages. \nImmigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens. \nBut if we\u2019re going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. \nFor instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people \u2013 our forgotten working people \u2013 have over immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, school, tax bills, and general living conditions. These are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. \nWe also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it\u2019s just not going to work out. \nIt\u2019s our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us. \nThen there\u2019s the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. \nI have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people. So many, many people. So sad. \nThey will be joining me on this stage in a little while, and I look forward to introducing \u2013 these are amazing, amazing people. \nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process \u2013 it\u2019s called Hillary Clinton.  \nThis includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into the U.S. \u2013 think of it \u2013 into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton. \nWeak, weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies. \nHe was released again after the crime and now he\u2019s out there at large. \nSarah had graduated from college with a 4.0 \u2013 top student in her class one day before her death. \nAlso among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open border policy was Grant Ronneback, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Arizona. A lot of you have known about Grant. \n...Thank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona \u2013 the state that has a very, very special place in my heart. \nI love the people of Arizona, and together, we are going to win the White House in November. \nNow, you know, this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also? So I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go and have some fun tonight. We\u2019re going to Arizona. Okay?\u201d \nThis will be a little bit different. This won\u2019t be a rally speech, per se. Instead, I\u2019m going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today \u2013 illegal immigration. \nI\u2019ve just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the president of Mexico \u2013 a man I like and respect very much and a man who truly loves his country \u2013 Mexico. \nAnd by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country \u2013 the United States. \nWe agreed on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border and to put the cartels out of business. \nWe also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two country, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship that we have between Mexico and the United States. \nIt was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for a while and in the end, we\u2019re all going to win \u2013 both countries \u2013 we\u2019re all going to win. \nThis is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations, and in a Trump administration, we\u2019re going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries. But it\u2019s going to be a fair relationship. We want fairness. \nBut to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly. \nSadly, sadly, there is no other way. \nThe truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. \nBut the facts aren\u2019t known because the media won\u2019t report on them, the politicians won\u2019t talk about them, and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That\u2019s the way it is. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Las Vegas, Nevada", "text": "We are lowering your taxes. She wants to raise your taxes substantially. \nWe\u2019re going to rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. Our veterans are going to be taken proper care of for once and for all. \nWe\u2019ll reduce surging crime and support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. \nWe\u2019re going to provide school choice \u2013 very important \u2013 and put an end to Common Core so we can bring our education local. \nWe will save the Second Amendment, which is under siege. The NRA endorsed Trump. The NRA endorsed us. \nAnd we will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \nAmericans are tired of being told by politicians that they have to defer their dreams to another day but they really mean defer their dreams to another decade. You know that and I know that and they know that. \nHillary has been there for 30 years and she\u2019s accomplished nothing. She\u2019s just made things worse. \nShe\u2019s a candidate of yesterday, and we are the movement of the future. \n...Our movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and from all walks of life. \nWe are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters. There\u2019s going to be a lot of them. A lot of them. \nWe are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and the special interests. \nWe are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and year for a better future for their children. \nWashington D.C. wants to think small. But I am asking you to dream big again. Dream big again. \nWith your vote, we are just nine days from the change you\u2019ve been waiting for your entire life. Think of it. Think of it. Nine days. \nAnd you\u2019re going to remember this day and you\u2019re going to remember when you cast your vote, and you\u2019re going to say that this was a very important day. But you\u2019re going to say the vote you cast was the most important vote that you\u2019ve ever cast because our country will start winning. We\u2019re going to start winning again. \nAnd you\u2019re going to be proud of your country again. \nAnd hopefully, hopefully, you\u2019ll be proud of your president. But you\u2019re going to be proud of your country. \nTogether, we\u2019re going to make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. \nThank you very much everybody. Get out and vote. God bless you. God bless you. Thank you. \nA good Samaritan who thought there had been a car accident stopped to help and he was also shot. \nThe illegal immigrant killer had a previous conviction as an accessory to murder in Carson City, and he had a record as long as your arm. But the Obama administration didn\u2019t want to put him out. \nJosh Wilkerson, whose mother I\u2019ve gotten to know during this campaign, was murdered at the age of 17. Josh, a student at a high school and a good student, was tortured, strangled, and beaten to death by an illegal immigrant and then his body was set on fire. \nAnd there are so many of these stories. \nWhen I become president this crime wave will end, and it will end very, very quickly. \nWe will end illegal immigration. We will deport all criminal illegal immigrants. You have a lot of people that are walking around. \nAnd the great thing \u2013 our local police they know who they are. They know them better than they know their own family. And we will get them out. \nNow when Hillary brought them out, they\u2019d bring them back to their country and the country very intelligently wouldn\u2019t take them. Right? And so, we would bring them back and we\u2019d release them into our society. She would always let them come back. She didn\u2019t want to make waves. \nThat will never, ever happen once, not once, with me. \nWe will also, it\u2019s so important...and by the way the border patrol agents of this country and I.C.E., both of them, they\u2019ve never endorsed a candidate for president before. Both groups, every one of them, both groups endorsed Donald Trump for that reason. \nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly-depleted military. We have the greatest people in the world but we need help. \nWe have the endorsements of over 200 admirals and generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. \nAnd I want to thank General Flynn for being here. Great guy, great man. \nOur Air Force is the smallest and oldest in its history and my plan calls for building new fighter jets. \nOh, you know what this is. Nellis, Nellis Air Force Base. You\u2019re going to have nice new planes. Nellis Air Force Base. \nDid you ever see where our fighter jets are so old that we can\u2019t get parts anymore for them? These are planes in service that are so old we can\u2019t get parts. \nThat\u2019s going to change. \nThe enemy has better planes than us and they buy them from us or they take them. \nWe also need a new foreign policy that puts America first again. America first. \nHillary and our failed Washington establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it\u2019s in worse shape. \nI mean think of it, all of that money, all of those lives, and it\u2019s in far worse shape than it ever has been by a factor of 10. \nThey\u2019ve dragged us into foreign wars. They\u2019ve made us less safe. And these are wars that they never win. \nWe don\u2019t win. We don\u2019t win at anything. We don\u2019t win at trade. We don\u2019t win at wars. \nThey\u2019ve left our borders wide open at home, and they\u2019ve shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. \nTo all Americans, I say it is now time for real leadership. We\u2019re going to have real leadership. \nSo sad, so sad. \nThank you. Thank you. \nIn closing, just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. \nWe\u2019re going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. \nWe will eliminate every unnecessary job killing regulation. \nWe will cancel every illegal Obama executive order. \nAnd by the way, Hillary Clinton, just in case you don\u2019t know it, you do know, she wants to raise your taxes substantially. \n...She\u2019s better than me. I never did it that well, boy. That\u2019s so great. \nWe are going to do so well with the Latinos. \nWe are going to do so well because we want security. We want safety. \nWe don\u2019t want people...you have so many people...they\u2019re living here legally. They have a job. They don\u2019t want their jobs taken away. I mean, it\u2019s...but I appreciate that. That was really nice. \nWe will also keep our nation safe. \nThank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. \nWe are going to keep our nation safe from a thing called terrorism. \nHillary Clinton wants to increase Syrian refugees pouring into our country by 550%. That\u2019s over Obama\u2019s numbers. That\u2019s over the thousands and thousands that are already coming in through Obama. \nWhen I\u2019m elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. Have no choice. \nAnd we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country, believe me. \nBut we\u2019re also going to work to build safe havens over there, and we\u2019re going to get the Gulf States to pay for it. We don\u2019t have to pay for it; they have plenty of money. We\u2019re going to get the Gulf States to pay for it, and they will pay for it. \nAnd we have to help the people but we just can\u2019t do this anymore, folks. We have problems. We don\u2019t need to be the great Trojan horse, a modern day version, the great Trojan horse. It\u2019s not going to be us. \nA Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall. \nSheldon, you have a great, great hotel but I tell you we could\u2019ve made this ballroom a little bit larger maybe, could\u2019ve made it larger. This is some great space. \nAnd we also have by the way the legendary Phil Ruffin of Las Vegas. Where is Phil? Where is he? All right, get him over here. He employs thousands of people and he\u2019s a great guy. \nHillary has pledged open borders and supports sanctuary cities. \nCountless Americans are killed by illegal immigrants because our government refuses to do its job. \nRight here in your state, 20-year-old Bryan Coursey was shot and paralyzed by an illegal immigrant. He fought for his life in the hospital for 17 days. Ultimately he died. Bryan was a basketball star loved by everybody with dreams of becoming a firefighter right here. \nOn Mother\u2019s Day in 2009, Carson City, born beautiful, beautiful person, just an incredible person, Rene Angulo, was out driving, looking for a job when he was shot in the head and murdered by a previously-deported illegal immigrant gang member. Everybody said we must get him out of our country. We must incarcerate him. We must do something. This guy was brutal. Rene was pulled from his vehicle and left to die on the side of a road. \nI said, \u201cBut we have not choice.\u201d \nWe need our Social Security. We need our Medicare. We have to rebuild our military. We need all of this stuff! We need all of this stuff. \nYeah, make sure that she\u2019s okay. \nSome of these people have been here for 8 hours. That\u2019s okay. You take your time. Take your time. Take your time. \nMaybe we can open that gate up? If we have to, we should. Yay!! Look at her! Are you okay? \nShe\u2019s tougher than all of us folks! She\u2019s been here for 8 hours. \nIf you need, you\u2019ll come right through here. Ahh, we have strong people. \nHey, did see where the Democratic National Committee \u2013 did you see this? They were paying. You know at these rallies where we use to have these fights? And I didn\u2019t understand it. I\u2019d say, \u201cWho\u2019s fighting?\u201d \nWe\u2019re like, there\u2019s so much love in these rooms. \nBy the way, there is no better place to be than a Trump rally. Right? \nSo, so I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d \nAnd we had one in Chicago, where the police \u2013 and we love our police by the way \u2013 where the police, a couple of them had gashes in their heads. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? This doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d \nSo it came out through WikiLeaks that we had thugs. Thugs who should be put in jail by the way. They attacked policemen in addition to our people. But they were paying thugs. \nHillary Clinton was paying thugs $1,500 each plus an iPhone. And they were paying these thugs to go in and disturb our rallies and get into fights. \nAnd that was on a tape made by a very talented young man, I will tell you that. Very talented guy. And they got him on a tape bragging about how they did it. \nAnd everybody blamed me right? And they blamed us. That they rallies are violent. \nLet me tell you, it\u2019s a disgrace. It\u2019s a disgrace. It is such a disgrace. \nAnd lots of other things happen, where they take care of people and then bad things, but we don\u2019t fall for it. \nTo be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. We\u2019ll support local police and federal law enforcement in an effort to aggressively reduce surging crime. \nSo far this year in Las Vegas, homicides have increased 27% over last year. \nAnd by the way \u2013 people don\u2019t know this because this dishonest media will never say it \u2013 murder rates are up. Right now, murder is up 45. \nThink of it, think of it, you know what it is? In 45 years, in 45 years, right now, the rates are the highest they have been. Murder rates, highest they\u2019ve been in 45 years. \nAnd they don\u2019t want to talk about it. They don\u2019t want to talk about it. \nYou know what you do? Let her out right here! Open the gate, let her out right here. So much easier. Fellas? Fellas? Open the gate. Use your heads! Let her our right here. \nThank you, darling, thank you! If you feel better come back. Will we take her back? Yes! We love her. Thank you. \nLatinos for Trump! I love it! Give me that stuff!! I love this stuff! From Mexico! Say hello. \nBut then he sang it a couple of times. And then it went to number one and all of the sudden he loved it. Okay? So he loved it. \nThat\u2019s the way it works. You never know. \nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Right? \nRight now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty or near the brink of poverty. 43% percent of African-American school-aged children are living in poverty. 34% of Hispanic school-aged children live in poverty. \nThis is unacceptable in our country. It\u2019s unacceptable in America. \nAs your president, I will go into the poorest communities and work on a national plan for revitalization. \nWe will break decades of failure and prove that real change is possible if we simply cut our ties with the failed politicians and politics of the past. \nAmerica has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA and Hillary loved it. \nAmerica, and this is something that every time I say it I always because it sounds crazy. I thought it was a typo. I thought it was 700 factories or 7,000 maybe. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary backed deal. \nWe\u2019re living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world. \nWhat\u2019s happened to our jobs is the greatest jobs theft \u2013 all because our politicians are either incompetent or they\u2019ve gotten so much campaign contributions or other things, or other things. And the special interest, you know special interest like what\u2019s happening, but we\u2019re getting wiped out. \nYou go to Michigan. You go to...I mean you go to New England. You look at areas around here. You look at what\u2019s happened. It\u2019s a one lane highway into Mexico, no way out. \nThey get the jobs. They get the money. They get the plants. \nI tell the story of my friend, he builds plants. He\u2019s the biggest in the world. He builds plants. That\u2019s what he does. That\u2019s what he wants to do. That\u2019s all he wants to do. If you said build an apartment, he wouldn\u2019t know how to go about it. Okay? All he does...he builds the biggest in the world. \nI said, \u201cHow is business?\u201d He said \u201cUnbelievable. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d \u201cWhere? In the United States?\u201d \u201cNo, not at all. In Mexico. It\u2019s the seventh wonder of the world.\u201d \nSo we\u2019ve got to have...we\u2019ve got to change things folks. \nA Trump administration will stop the horrible, horrible, horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership. We will renegotiate NAFTA. And we are going to stand up to China\u2019s currency manipulation. \nI have great relationships with China but their currency manipulation, what they do to our country, is unbelievable. \nWe have a trade balance \u2013 think of this we have a deficit, trade deficit, with China, almost $500 billion a year. We owe China $1.5 trillion. \nThat\u2019s a good act. They come in. They take our jobs. They make our product. They make a fortune. And we owe them $1.5 trillion. It\u2019s a good act. \nBut we\u2019ll get it solved. \nI have great relations with China. I\u2019ve made a lot of money with China. The biggest bank in the world is a tenant of mine in Manhattan and it\u2019s from China. The biggest bank in the world by far, not even close. The condos \u2013 I own the Bank of America building with a great partner in San Francisco, got it through China, through a certain very complicated route. \nWe\u2019re going to lower taxes on American business from 35% to 15%. \nWe\u2019re going to cut taxes for middle class family by hundreds of billions of dollars a year. \nAnd my infrastructure plan will provide help for projects like the proposed Interstate 11 here in your state. \nWe will become a rich nation again. We will become a rich country. \nAnd we have to be a rich country in order to do what we have to do. \nA woman came up to me recently, and she said, \u201cMr. Trump, it sounds so crass when you say we\u2019re going to become a rich nation.\u201d \nThey don\u2019t want to be giving Iran $1.7 billion in cash. It\u2019d be from here up to the ceiling. \nThey don\u2019t want to \u2013 remember three weeks ago, they had 800 people that they were getting to deport. Right? You saw this, right? They had them bad. They were tough. Anybody that gets deported from this country, believe me, they have to be tough. \nSo they have 800. Little mistake. Instead of deporting them, they all became United States citizens. \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s not the worst of it. The worst of it \u2013 it wasn\u2019t 800 people, it was 1,800 people. Okay? \nSo congratulations you have some wonderful new citizens of this country. \nAnd they want to say that\u2019s okay, fix the problem, that\u2019s okay, fix it. They said that wouldn\u2019t be constitutional. Give me a break. \nAll right, so we\u2019re stuck. \n$1.7 billion in cash to Iran. Can you believe? Can you imagine their eyes when they saw that money being brought in by truck? Can you imagine? \nDid you ever see what a million dollars looks like in cash? It\u2019s a lot of...that\u2019s a lot of money. \n$1.7 billion in cash. And then what do they do? They grab our sailors, our 10 sailors, destroy their lives, humiliate those people. Instead of saying, \u201cHey listen, you\u2019re in our waters, you\u2019ve got to get over a little bit.\u201d They humiliated the sailors. They humiliated our country, and they would\u2019ve kept them except their $150 billion payment started the next day. Okay? Stupid they\u2019re not. \nAnd people are tired of it. We\u2019re tired. We\u2019re sick and tired of it. \nAnd don\u2019t forget I was on the other side for a long time, folks. I understand that side very well. \nAnd it\u2019s a good life but I love this country. I love the people of this country, and we\u2019re going to change it. We\u2019re going to change. We\u2019re going to do it right. \nSo go out and vote with all your heart and soul, and we\u2019re going to make America great again, that I can tell you. Okay? \nRestoring honesty to our government and the rule of law to our society will be one of my truly highest priorities. \nNow we have a lot. We have to rebuild our military. We have to create borders. We have to do so much. But that\u2019s going to be right up there. \nMy contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption. \nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words that we all, not me, we have to say. \nWhen we win on Nov. 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. \nYou know, I told people the other day drain the swamp. I said I don\u2019t really like that expression. This was two weeks ago. I said I don\u2019t love that expression. So hokey. I thought it was hokey. \nI said you know and all of the sudden, I said I hate to use this, it\u2019s sort of like it doesn\u2019t work right. \nAnd I said it two weeks ago to a big crowd, and I said it and the place went crazy. \nThen I said it a second time, and the place went even crazier. \nAnd then the third time, like you, they started saying it before I said it. \nAnd all of the sudden, I decided I love that expression. It\u2019s a great expression. Crazy, right? Drain the swamp. \nThank you. \nYou know a man who loved Las Vegas was Frank Sinatra. And he had his...we like Frank Sinatra, right? \nFrank Sinatra, he was great, and when he originally heard and sang for the first time \u201cMy Way\u201d. How do we like \u201cMy Way\u201d, yes? But he didn\u2019t like it. \nShe was thinking. I mean, she said it. It was a statement she made. \nAnd effectively, I guess you\u2019d call that a bribe, wouldn\u2019t you? Wouldn\u2019t that be called a bribe? \nAnd effectively, I guess you\u2019d call that a bribe, wouldn\u2019t you? Wouldn\u2019t that be called a bribe? How could she say they\u2019re going to make a decision on her and you\u2019re talking about you\u2019re going to reappoint? She said it publicly, I believe. \nWhen I heard it, I found it a little bit hard to believe that she\u2019d say that. \nThis is what we mean when we say the system is rigged. It\u2019s rigged. \nWhat makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws and that we are all equal under those laws. \nHillary\u2019s corruption shreds the principles on which our nation was founded. \nWhen the powerful can get away with anything because they have the money and the connections to rig the system, then the people lose hope and confidence in the future of their country. \nCorruption is corrosive to the soul of a democracy, and it must be stopped and we\u2019re going to stop it. \nBecause we have one ultimate check on Hillary\u2019s corruption, and that is the power of the vote. The power of the vote. \nThe only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote by the tens of millions, including millions of people voting for the first time in their lives. \nThere was a great guy on television that I have to tell you about. His name was Sid Miller [sp] from Texas. Oh, they know Sid Miller? We create yet another star. \nBut he was on this morning. He was on Fox and a lot of you saw him. And he said, \u201cYou know, these New Yorkers have it all wrong. You guys have it all wrong.\u201d He\u2019s from Texas wearing a big white hat, smart guy. He said, \u201cYou know, in Texas I kept reading where we\u2019re even, and I said, \u2018Wow, I don\u2019t think so because I see the enthusiasm\u2019 but the voting started.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you we have more people voting now than we\u2019ve ever had \u2013 ever \u2013 in an election. They\u2019re all coming from all over. They\u2019re people we\u2019ve never seen before, they\u2019ve never voted before, or they haven\u2019t voted for 20 years and they\u2019re all voting for Trump.\u201d \nAnd when they say, and he said, \u201cAnd when I listen to these guys talking,\u201d and I know every one of them because these are the most honest...I tell you what, these are the most dishonest human beings right back there. \nFor instance, when we tell them to turn the cameras to show this incredible record crowd, record for this ballroom \u2013 this is the record for this ballroom. Sheldon told me that himself. Record. They don\u2019t show it. You\u2019re wasting your time. They don\u2019t show it because they\u2019re dishonest. Because they don\u2019t want to show the crowds that we get the biggest ever in this history of this country. There\u2019s never been a movement like this, and they don\u2019t want to show it. \nAnd we\u2019re going to go into it in a couple of seconds but they are very dishonest. \nThe media is very, very dishonest. Show the crowd. \nWhy don\u2019t you show the crowd? Turn the cameras. \nThey\u2019ll get up, a couple of them get up there and say, Donald Trump spoke today before a small crowd. It\u2019s disgusting. \nThe other day, a man got up. We had 17,000 people. He said Donald Trump spoke in front of a few thousand people. Well, a few to me means three. I don\u2019t\u2019 know that\u2019s the way I grew up. When I hear a few thousand people, that sort of means to me like three. \nAnyway, very, very dishonest people. \nBut Sid Miller said, \u201cWe\u2019ve never had anything like this. It\u2019s 50% higher than it has ever been before in Texas.\u201d \nAnd he said we\u2019re going to win. And he wasn\u2019t for me. He said, \u201cTrump is going to win by massive numbers, bigger than anyone has ever seen.\u201d \nAnd he said, \u201cSo I don\u2019t know what you people are talking about on television where they\u2019re saying the vote in Texas is going to very close.\u201d \nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you people are talking about. You must be talking about a different Texas than the one I\u2019m from.\u201d \nSo we love the people in Texas, and I know what\u2019s going on. \nAnd you know what else? The same thing is happening in Florida. The same thing is happening in North Carolina. \nIt\u2019s happening all over because people are sick and tired of stupidity and deals and \u2013 \nLook at Iran. Look at the Iran deal. They\u2019re sick and tired of the Iran deal. \nHillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal problems. \nHer criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional, and purposeful. \nHillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure and exposure. \nShe set up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk and put the safety and security of your children at risk. \nTo cover up her crimes, she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena. After, after, after, after she gets a subpoena and she deletes and bleaches. \nAnd nobody\u2019s even ever heard of bleaching. Did anybody ever hear of bleaching? You know why? It\u2019s such an expensive process but it makes them go away. \nBut I have a feeling they\u2019ve just found a lot of them, don\u2019t you think? \nHuma. They just found a lot of them. \nWe never thought we were going to say thank you to Anthony Weiner. \nShe made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. She lied to the Congress under oath and she lied to the FBI many times. And then two boxes of email evidence has just recently went mysteriously missing. \nThen you have the WikiLeaks revelation, which has exposed criminal corruption at the highest levels of our government. \nHillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale, and if she ever did get the chance, which we\u2019re not going to let her have, she\u2019d put the Oval Office up for sale also. You have no doubt about that. \nYet, now it\u2019s reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI. That\u2019s because the Department of Justice is trying so hard to protect Hillary Clinton. \nThey didn\u2019t try to protect our generals. They didn\u2019t try to protect a lot of people. \nHow can the attorney and general be involved in this case or tell the FBI what to do,  when the attorney general violated sanctity of law by secretly meeting with Bill Clinton, the husband of the possible target of this investigation and a possible target himself, in an airplane on a tarmac in Arizona? \nRemember? He was going to play golf, remember? But he just be happen to be at the airport hanging around, and the Attorney General\u2019s plane drove by. Right? \n...Let\u2019s say hello. Let\u2019s say hello. \nIt was just a chance meeting, they said.  \nWell, the meeting lasted 39 minutes and they supposedly talked about golf and grandchildren.  \nSo I give two minutes to golf and I give five minutes to grandchildren. \nBut what they probably really talked about was the Attorney General\u2019s reappointment should Hillary Clinton become president, which I don\u2019t think is going to happen. \nBecause of this highly inappropriate meeting at best, the Attorney General took herself essentially out of the case and put Director Comey in charge of making decisions. You saw that. Decision-making process. \nSo why is she now allowed to fight so hard to get someone who is so obviously guilty on so many different fronts off the hook? \nIn fact, it was publicly reported that sources close to Hilary Clinton said, and I think she had actually said to the papers that she was thinking of reappointing Attorney General Lynch. \nThank you very much. \nThis is a record crowd. I want to thank the great owner of this hotel and his incredible wife. She\u2019s an incredible woman. Sheldon Adelson. \nAnd really incredible people and they\u2019ve been so supportive and we appreciate it. We appreciate it very much. \nAnd Phil Ruffin, one of our great supporters, is here tonight. Phil. We love Phil. \nAnd we\u2019re doing great in the polls. We\u2019re winning many national polls. And we\u2019re ahead in many states, including your great state and North Carolina, and Ohio, and Florida, and Iowa and so many others. \nAnd just so you know these polls, came out yesterday and today. This was before the blow-up on Friday. These polls are from before the blow-up so we\u2019ll see. \nWe\u2019re on the cusp of really incredible, historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to our families, communities, and citizens. \nIn nine days we are going to win the state of Nevada. Nevada. The state of Nevada, right? \nYou know, I don\u2019t know if you know but everybody in New York says it the other way. And I did that once and I never will do it again, believe me. \nBut we\u2019re going to win the state of Nevada, and we\u2019re going to win back the White House. \nEarly voting is underway so make sure you get to the polls. \nWho\u2019s voting? That\u2019s like 50%. If anybody wants to leave right now, go ahead. I won\u2019t be insulted. There\u2019s plenty of people outside that want to take your place, okay? \nNo, make sure you vote because otherwise this incredible movement that we\u2019ve created together, we won\u2019t get there, and that will be very, very bad for all of us. It will be very bad for the country. \nA Trump administration will immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. \nIt\u2019s just been announced that the citizens of Nevada are going to experience a massive, massive \u2013 frankly I don\u2019t even want to tell you what the number is, I won\u2019t because you\u2019ll walk out of here depressed \u2013 double-digit hike in their Obamacare premiums for the year. \nTen of Nevada\u2019s 16 counties will have only Obamacare, and, think of it, you\u2019re going to have one exchange insurer to choose from. They are in a very good position to negotiate with you, aren\u2019t they? \nNot with Trump. We\u2019re going to get rid of it, and we\u2019re going to have health care that is so good and so much less expensive. \nBecause Obamacare, forgetting about the cost which is ridiculous, it\u2019s no good. It doesn\u2019t work. And your deductibles are so high, you\u2019re never going to be able to use it, so. \nObamacare is a catastrophe for your state. In Minnesota, where the premium increase, will be close to 60%, the Democratic governor has just said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. \nHillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. In fact, much more expensive. \nMy contract with the American voter outlines a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. And I\u2019m asking for your vote so we can save health care for every family in your state and in this country. \nReal change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington. You\u2019ve been seeing a little a corruption. Right? You\u2019ve been seeing. System is rigged. It\u2019s rigged. A little corruption you\u2019ve been watching. \nAs you\u2019ve heard, it was just announced on Friday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton.

It\u2019s got to be that way. \nNow, the people in charge say things can\u2019t change. I\u2019m here today to tell you that we have to change. We have no choice. We have to change. \nWe\u2019re going to put America back to work. We\u2019re going to make our own products. We\u2019re going to put America back to work. \nWe\u2019re going to rebuild our inner cities, which are absolutely a shame and so sad, going to take care of our African-American people that have been mistreated for so long. \nWe\u2019re going to make you and your families safe, secure, and prosperous. Prosperous again. \nTogether, we will put the American people first again. First again. \nWe will make our communities wealthy. We will make our cities safe again. We will make our country strong again. \nLadies and gentlemen, we will make America great again! Remember. Thank you! \nThank you! Thank you very much everybody! \nIt\u2019s important to understand what America First means. \nIt means on foreign policy, we will never enter into any conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation. It has to make us safer as a nation. \nThis is the opposite of Hillary\u2019s foreign policy, which invaded Libya, destabilized Iraq, unleashed ISIS and threw Syria into chaos and created the mass migration, which is wrecking havoc all over the world and while putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the Middle East. And they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks, we have made them that way. \nBetter hope I\u2019m president. \nOn trade, America First means the American worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition \u2013 what\u2019s happening here is absolutely a disgrace. \nNo PPP [sic]. You\u2019re right about that. So and you mean no PP. \nWe are going \u2013 and remember this \u2013 we are only going to have great trade deals. Okay? We are only going to have that. \nWe\u2019re not going to approve as somebody just said the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is a disaster \u2013 a disaster \u2013 for our country. Almost as bad as NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places and in particular Mexico. \nIf it\u2019s not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it. It\u2019s got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we\u2019re suffering big league and it\u2019s getting worse. \nOn energy policy, America First means opening up America\u2019s great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers, including our wonderful and hardworking miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this administration. \nOn economic policy, America First means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the United States, substantially lowering taxes for middle class Americans and businesses. Likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level, we will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small businesses, and for people that want to survive and do well in our country. \nOn immigration policy, America First means protecting the jobs, wages, and security of American workers. Whether first or tenth generation, no matter who you are, we\u2019re going to protect your job because let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we\u2019re babies.

How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can\u2019t do it. \nWe have end \u2013 education has to be local. \nRebuild the country\u2019s infrastructure. Nobody can do that like me. Believe me. It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought. \nI look at these roads being built all over the country and I say I can build those things for one-third. What they do is unbelievable. How bad. \nYou know, we\u2019re building on Pennsylvania Avenue \u2013 the Old Post Office. We\u2019re converting it to one of the world\u2019s great hotels. It\u2019s going to be the best hotel in Washington D.C. \nWe got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. \nIt was the most highly sought after or one of them but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. \nWe got it. People were shocked Trump got it. \nWell, we got it for two reasons. Number one, we\u2019re really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I\u2019ll add in a third, we had a great financial statement because the General Services who are terrific people by the way and talented people they wanted to do a great job and they want to make sure it got built. \nSo we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. \nYou come into La Guardia Airport, it\u2019s like we\u2019re in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. They throw down asphalt...You look at these airports. We are like a third world country. \nAnd I come in from China, and I come in from Qatar, and I come in from different places and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come back to this country and you have LAX disaster \u2013 you have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. \nSave Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it. Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse but save it. \nPeople have been paying in for years and now many of these candidates want to cut it. \nYou save it by making the United States by making us rich again by taking back all of the money that\u2019s being lost. \nRenegotiate our foreign trade deals. \nReduce our $18 trillion in debt because believe me we\u2019re in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that frankly has been good to me but I still hate to see what\u2019s happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated. Be careful of a bubble because what you\u2019ve seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful. \nAnd strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important. \nSadly, the American dream is dead.

I don\u2019t have to. Believe it or not. \nI\u2019m doing that to say that that\u2019s the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking. \nWe have losers. We have losers. We have people that don\u2019t have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain. \nSo I put together this statement and the only reason I\u2019m telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going. \nBecause if we have another three or four years \u2013 you know, we\u2019re at $18 trillion now. We\u2019re soon going to be at $20 trillion. \nAccording to the economists who I\u2019m not big believers in but nevertheless this is what they\u2019re saying that $24 trillion \u2013 we\u2019re very close \u2013 that\u2019s the point of no return. \n$24 trillion. We will be there soon. That\u2019s when we become Greece. That\u2019s when we become a country that\u2019s unsalvageable. And we\u2019re going to be there very soon. We\u2019re going to be there very soon. \nSo, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly. \nI would repeal and replace the big lie \u2013 Obamacare. \nI would build a great wall. And nobody builds walls better than me, believe me. And I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words \nNobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody. \nI will find within our military I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur. I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that\u2019s going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody \u2013 nobody \u2013 will be pushing us around. \nI will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. \nAnd we won\u2019t be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who\u2019s making a horrible and laughable deal, who\u2019s just being tapped along as they make weapons right now and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old and falls and breaks his leg. I won\u2019t be doing that, and I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you. \nI will immediately terminate President Obama\u2019s illegal executive order on immigration. Immediately. \nFully support and back up the Second Amendment. \nNow it\u2019s very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity in a very, very hardcore prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers \u2013 two vicious people \u2013 escaped and nobody knows where they are. \nAnd a woman was on television this morning and...she said, \u201cYou know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns. I didn\u2019t want guns. And now, since this happened, it\u2019s up in the prison area, my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns. We now have a gun in every table. We\u2019re ready to start shooting.\u201d \nI said very interesting. So protect the Second Amendment. \nPosted by Jenny Jiang on Tuesday, June 16, 2015 \u00b7 Leave a Comment \u00a0 \nSo, Ford will come back. They\u2019ll all come back. \nAnd I will say this. This is going to be an election in my opinion that\u2019s based on competence. \nSomebody said...to me the other day \u2013 a reporter, a very nice reporter, \u201cBut Mr. Trump, you\u2019re not a nice person.\u201d \n...But actually I am. I think I am a nice person. People that know me like me. Does my family like me? I think so. Right?  \n...So the reporter said to me the other day, \u201cBut Mr. Trump, you\u2019re not a nice person. How can you get people to vote for you?\u201d \nI said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I said, \u201cI think that number one. I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think I\u2019m actually a very nice person.\u201d \nBut I said, \u201cThis is going to be an election that\u2019s based on competence because people are tired of these nice people and they\u2019re tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.\u201d \nAnd they\u2019re tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita than any nation in the world and we\u2019re 26th in the world. 25 countries are better than us at education and some of them are like third world countries. \nBut we\u2019re becoming a third world country because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads \u2013 everything. \nSo one of the things I did, I said, \u201cYou know what I\u2019ll do? I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Because a lot of people said, \u201cHe\u2019ll never run. Number one, he won\u2019t want to give up his lifestyle.\u201d They\u2019re right about that but I\u2019m doing it. \nNumber two, I\u2019m a private company. So nobody knows what I\u2019m worth. \nAnd the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth. \nSo I said, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m proud of my net worth. I\u2019ve done an amazing job.\u201d \nI started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens. And my father said \u2013 I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot. \nBut he used to say, \u201cDonald, don\u2019t go into Manhattan. That\u2019s the big leagues. We don\u2019t know anything about that. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d \nI said, \u201cDad, I\u2019ve got to go to Manhattan. I got to build those big buildings. I\u2019ve got to do it, dad. I\u2019ve got to do it.\u201d \nAnd after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals. The Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the West Side. I did a lot of great deals and I did them early and young. \nAnd now I\u2019m building all over the world and I love what I\u2019m doing. \nBut they all said \u2013 a lot of the pundits on television \u2013 \u201cWell, Donald will never run and one of the main reasons is he\u2019s private and he\u2019s probably not as successful as everybody thinks.\u201d \nSo I said to myself, \u201cYou know, nobody\u2019s ever going to know unless I run.\u201d Because I\u2019m really proud of my success. I really am. \nI\u2019ve employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical, that means education, that means everything. \nSo a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months because it\u2019s big and complex and they\u2019ve put together a statement \u2013 a financial statement. \nThis is a summary but everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don\u2019t need extensions or anything. We\u2019ll be filing it right on time. We don\u2019t need anything. \nAnd it was even reported incorrectly yesterday because they said, \u201cHe had assets of $9 billion.\u201d \nI said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s the wrong number.\u201d \nThat\u2019s the wrong number. Not assets. \nSo they put together this and before I say it I have to say this: I made it the old fashioned way. It\u2019s real estate. You know, it\u2019s real estate. It\u2019s labor and it\u2019s unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren\u2019t in unions and it\u2019s all over the place and building all over the world. \nAnd I have assets \u2013 big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected \u2013 $9.24 billion. \nAnd I have liabilities of about $500 million. That\u2019s long-term debt, very low interest rates. \nIn fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, \u201cDonald, you don\u2019t have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t need it. I don\u2019t want it.\u201d And I\u2019ve been there. I don\u2019t want it. But in two seconds, they\u2019d give me whatever I wanted. \nSo I have a total net worth and now with the increase it will be well over $10 billion. But here a total net worth of $8 billion \u2013 net worth, not assets, not liabilities. A net worth after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets \u2013 Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street \u2013 sometimes referred to as the Trump Building...many other places all over the world \u2013 so the total is $8.737 billion. \nPosted by Jenny Jiang on Tuesday, June 16, 2015 \u00b7 Leave a Comment \u00a0 \nSo under President Trump, here\u2019s what would happen. \nThe head of Ford would call me back I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news. But it could be he\u2019d want to be cool and he\u2019ll wait \u2019till the next day. You know, they want to be a little cool. \nAnd he\u2019ll say, \u201cPlease, please, please.\u201d He\u2019ll beg for a little while. And I\u2019ll say, \u201cNo interest.\u201d \nThen he\u2019ll call all sorts of political people, and I\u2019ll say, \u201cSorry fellas. No interest.\u201d Because I don\u2019t need anybody\u2019s money. It\u2019s nice. I don\u2019t need anybody\u2019s money. \nI\u2019m using my own money. I\u2019m not using the lobbyists. I\u2019m not using donors. I don\u2019t care. \nI\u2019m really rich. I\u2019ll show you that in a second. \nAnd by the way, I\u2019m not even saying that in a brag \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of mindset, that\u2019s the kind of thinking you need for this country. \nSo because we\u2019ve got to make the country rich. \nIt sounds crass. Somebody said, \u201cOh, it sounds crass.\u201d \nIt\u2019s not crass. We\u2019ve got $18 trillion in debt. We\u2019ve got nothing but problems. \nWe\u2019ve got a military that needs equipments all over the place. We\u2019ve got nuclear weapons that are obsolete. We\u2019ve got nothing. \nWe\u2019ve got Social Security that\u2019s going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn\u2019t bring money into the country. All these people want to cut the hell out of it. I\u2019m not going to cut it at all. I\u2019m going to bring money in and we\u2019re going to save it. \nBut here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. \nAfter I\u2019m called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I\u2019m called by all of the special interests and by the donors and by the lobbyists and they have zero chance of convincing me \u2013 zero, I\u2019ll get a call from the head of Ford. \nHe\u2019ll say, \u201cPlease reconsider.\u201d I\u2019ll say, \u201cNo.\u201d \nHe\u2019ll say, \u201cMr. President, we\u2019ve decided to move the plant back into the United States. We\u2019re not going to build it in Mexico.\u201d \nThat\u2019s it. They have no choice. They have no choice. \nThere are hundreds of things like that. \nI\u2019ll give you another example. \nSaudi Arabia. They make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. \nI love the Saudis. Many of them are in this building. \nThey make $1 billion a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships, we say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to protect.\u201d What are we doing? They\u2019ve got nothing but money. If the right person asked them, they\u2019d pay a fortune. They wouldn\u2019t be there except for us. \nAnd believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, \u201cYemen was a great victory.\u201d \nTwo weeks later, the place was blown up and they kept our equipment. They always keep our equipment. We don\u2019t send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. \nWe ought to send some real junk because frankly it would be \u2013 we ought to send our surplus. We\u2019re always losing this gorgeous brand new stuff. \nBut look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? \nSaudi Arabia without us is gone. They\u2019re gone. \nAnd I\u2019m the one who made all the right predictions about Iraq. \nYou know, all of these politicians that I\u2019m running against now \u2013 it\u2019s so nice to say I\u2019m running as opposed to saying if I run, if I run. I\u2019m running. \nBut all of these politicians I\u2019m running against now they\u2019re trying to disassociate \u2013 \nI mean you look at Bush. It took him five days to answer the question on Iraq. He couldn\u2019t answer the question. He didn\u2019t know. I said, \u201cIs he intelligent? \nThen I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question. Is Iraq a good thing or a bad thing? He didn\u2019t know. He couldn\u2019t answer the question. \nHow are these people going to lead us? How are we going to go back and make it great again? We can\u2019t. They don\u2019t have a clue. They can\u2019t lead us. They can\u2019t even answer simple questions. \nIt was terrible. \nBut Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. \nNow, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. \nAnd I used to say it. There are ships at sea \u2013 and this was during the worst crisis \u2013 that were loaded up with oil and the cartel kept the price up because again they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders. \nThere is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again and therefore make it great again because we need money. We\u2019re dying. We\u2019re dying. We need money. We have to do it. And we need the right people. \nPosted by Jenny Jiang on Tuesday, June 16, 2015 \u00b7 Leave a Comment \u00a0 \nWe are rebuilding China. We are rebuilding many countries. \nChina you go there now \u2013 roads, bridges, schools. You never saw anything like it. \nThey have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes, and they\u2019re all over the place. \nWe have all the cards but we don\u2019t know how to use them. We don\u2019t even know that we have the cards because our leaders don\u2019t understand the game. \nWe can turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly. \nNow they\u2019re going militarily. They\u2019re building a military island in the middle of the South China Sea. A military island! \nNow, our country could never do that because we\u2019d have to get environmental clearance and the environmentalists wouldn\u2019t let our country \u2013 we would never build in an ocean. \nThey built it in about one year this massive military port. \nThey\u2019re building up their military to a point that is very scary. \nYou have a problem with ISIS, you have a bigger problem with China. \nAnd in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade is Mexico. \nSo this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible story. I hate to hear it.\u201d \nBut I have another one \u2013 Ford. \nSo Mexico takes a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out, everybody thought the deal was dead. \nReported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It\u2019s going in. That\u2019s going into Tennessee. Great state, great people. \nAll of a sudden at the last moment, this big car manufacturer \u2013 foreign \u2013 announces they\u2019re not going to Tennessee; they\u2019re going to spend their billion dollars in Mexico instead. Not good. \nNow, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. \n$2.5 billion. It\u2019s going to be one of the largest in the world. \nFord \u2013 good company. \nSo I announced that I\u2019m running for President. \n...One of the early things I would do probably even before I got in \u2013 and I wouldn\u2019t even use \u2013 you know I have \u2013 I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones. \nYou\u2019ve got a lot of them that are overrated. They\u2019re not good. They think they are. They get good stories because the newspapers get buffaloed. But they\u2019re not good. \nBut I know the best negotiators in the world and I\u2019d put them one for each country. Believe me, folks, we will do very, very well. Very, very well. \nBut I wouldn\u2019t even waste my time with this one. \nI would call up the head of Ford, who I know, if I was President, and say \u201cCongratulations. I understand that you\u2019re building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you\u2019re going to take your cars and sell them to the United States at zero tax, just flow them across the border.\u201d \nAnd you say to yourself, \u201cHow does that help us? Right? How does that help us? Where is that good?\u201d \nIt\u2019s not. \nSo I\u2019d say, \u201cCongratulations. That\u2019s the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we\u2019re going to charge you a 35% tax. Okay? And that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction and that\u2019s it.\u201d \nNow, here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. \nIf it\u2019s not me in this position, it\u2019s one of these politicians that we\u2019re running against...and here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, they\u2019re not so stupid. They know it\u2019s not a good thing. And they may even be upset by it. \nBut then they\u2019re going to get a call from their donors or probably from the lobbyists for Ford and say, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that to Ford because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can\u2019t do that to Ford.\u201d \nAnd guess what? No problem. They\u2019re going to build it in Mexico. They\u2019re going to take away thousands of jobs. It\u2019s very bad for us. \nPosted by Jenny Jiang on Tuesday, June 16, 2015 \u00b7 Leave a Comment \u00a0 \nIt can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people. \nWe have people that aren\u2019t working. We have people that have no incentive to work. \nBut they\u2019re going to have incentive to work because the greatest social program is a job. \nAnd they\u2019ll be proud and they\u2019ll love it and they\u2019ll make much more money than they would\u2019ve ever made. And they\u2019ll be doing so well and we\u2019re going to be thriving as a country \u2013 thriving. \nIt can happen. \nI will be the greatest jobs President that God ever created. I\u2019ll tell you that. \nI\u2019ll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. \nI\u2019ll bring back our jobs and I\u2019ll bring back our money. \nRight now, think of this. We owe China $1.3 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. \nSo they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money and then they loan us back the money and  we pay them an interest. And then the dollar goes up so their deal\u2019s even better. \nHow stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they? \n...I\u2019m going to tell you a couple of stories about trade because I\u2019m totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons. \nNumber one, the people negotiating it don\u2019t have a clue. Our President doesn\u2019t have a clue. He\u2019s a bad negotiator. \nHe\u2019s the one who did [Bowe] Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl. They get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there. We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. \nThat\u2019s the negotiator we have. \nTake a look at the deal he\u2019s making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won\u2019t exist very long. It\u2019s a disaster and we have to protect Israel. \nSo we need people \u2013 I\u2019m a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. \nIf you don\u2019t have talented people, if you don\u2019t have great leadership, if you don\u2019t have people that know business not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs just about are gotten, free trade is terrible. \nFree trade can be wonderful if you have smart people. \nBut we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren\u2019t smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests and it\u2019s just not going to work. \nSo here\u2019s a couple of stories happened recently. \nA friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And you know China comes over and they dump all their stuff and I buy it. I buy it because frankly I have an obligation to buy it. Because they devalued their currency so brilliantly. They just did it recently and nobody thought they could do it again. \nBut with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything \u2013 everything \u2013 they got away with it again. \nAnd it\u2019s impossible for our people here to compete. \nSo I want to tell you this story. \nA friend of mine is a great manufacturer. Calls me up a few weeks ago. He\u2019s very upset. \nI said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d \nHe said, \u201cYou know, I make great product.\u201d And I said, \u201cI know. I know that because I buy the product.\u201d He said, \u201cI can\u2019t get it into China. They won\u2019t accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental. They talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it.\u201d \nI said, \u201cWait a minute. That\u2019s terrible. Does anyone know this?\u201d \nHe said, \u201cYeah, they do it all the time with other people.\u201d \nI said, \u201cThey send it back?\u201d \nHe said, \u201cYeah. I finally go it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They\u2019re not supposed to be doing that.\u201d \nI told him, \u201cNo, they do charge a tariff on trucks when we send trucks and other things over there. Ask Boeing. They wanted Boeing secrets. They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agree to buy planes from Boeing.\u201d \nHey, I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for \u2013 I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? \nI own a big chunk of the Bank of America building in 1290 Avenue of the Americas that I got from China is a war. Very valuable. I love China. \nBiggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarter is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. \nPeople say, \u201cOh, you don\u2019t like China.\u201d No, I love them. \nBut their leaders are much smarter than our leaders and we can\u2019t sustain ourselves with that. \nThere\u2019s too much. \nIt\u2019s like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That\u2019s the difference between China\u2019s leaders and our leaders. They are ripping us. \nPosted by Jenny Jiang on Tuesday, June 16, 2015 \u00b7 Leave a Comment \u00a0 \nSo I\u2019ve watched the politicians. I\u2019ve dealt with them all my life. \nIf you can\u2019t make a good deal with a politician, then there\u2019s something wrong with you. You\u2019re certainly not very good. \nAnd that\u2019s what we have representing us. \nThey will never make America great again. They don\u2019t even have a chance. \nThey\u2019re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests. Fully. They control them. \nHey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They\u2019re great. \nBut you know what? It won\u2019t happen. It won\u2019t happen because we have to stop doing things for some people but for this country it\u2019s destroying our country. We have to stop and it has to stop now. \nNow, our country needs a truly great leader and we need a truly great leader now. \nWe need a leader that wrote The Art of the Deal. \nWe need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. \nOur vets have been abandoned. \nAnd we also need a cheerleader. \nYou know, when President Obama was elected, I said, \u201cWell, the one thing I think he\u2019ll do well, I think he\u2019ll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he\u2019d be a great spirit. He was vibrant. He was young.\u201d \nI really thought that he would be a great cheerleader. \nHe\u2019s not a leader. That\u2019s true. You\u2019re right about that. \nBut he wasn\u2019t a cheerleader. He\u2019s actually a negative force. He\u2019s been a negative force. He wasn\u2019t a cheerleader. He was the opposite. \nWe need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again. It\u2019s not great again. \nWe need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that. \nAnd I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. \nThey\u2019re saying, \u201cDad, you\u2019re going to do something that\u2019s going to be so tough.\u201d \nYou know, all of my life I\u2019ve heard that a truly successful person \u2013 a really, really, really successful person \u2013 and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. Just can\u2019t happen. \nAnd yet, that\u2019s the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again. \nSo ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for President of the United States and we are going to make our country great again! \nPosted by Jenny Jiang on Tuesday, June 16, 2015 \u00b7 Leave a Comment \u00a0 \nWell, you need somebody because politicians are all talk no action. Nothing\u2019s going to get done. They will not bring us \u2013 believe me \u2013 to the promise land. \nThey will not. \nAs an example, I\u2019ve been on the circuit making speeches. And I hear my fellow Republicans and they\u2019re wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. \nThey don\u2019t know how to bring it about. They\u2019d come up to my office. I\u2019m meeting with three of them in the next week. And they don\u2019t know, \u201cAre you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? How do we do it?\u201d \nI like them and I hear their speeches. And they don\u2019t talk jobs and they don\u2019t talk China. \nWhen was the last time you heard, \u201cChina\u2019s killing us. They\u2019re devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn\u2019t believe it. It makes it impossible for our companies to compete. Impossible. They\u2019re killing us.\u201d \nBut you don\u2019t hear that from anybody else. You don\u2019t hear it from anybody else. \nAnd I watch their speeches...of these people and they say, \u201cThe sun will rise. The moon will set. All sorts of wonderful things will happen.\u201d \nAnd people are saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don\u2019t need the rhetoric. I want a job.\u201d \nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. \nAnd it\u2019s going to get worse because remember Obamacare really kicks in in \u201916. 2016. \nObama is going to be out playing golf. He might even be in one of my courses. \nI would invite him. I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world so I\u2019d say, \u201cYou know what, if he wants, I have one right next to the White House. Right on the Potomac. If he\u2019d like to play, that\u2019s fine.\u201d \nIn fact, I\u2019d love him to leave early and play. That would be a very good thing. \nBut Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. \nDoctors are quitting. I have a friend who\u2019s a doctor and he said to me the other day, \u201cDonald, I\u2019d never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It\u2019s a disaster. Patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good; they have no plan now.\u201d \nWe have to repeal Obamacare and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody but much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it. \nPosted by Jenny Jiang on Tuesday, June 16, 2015 \u00b7 Leave a Comment \u00a0 \n...Last quarter it was just announced our gross domestic product \u2013 a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. \nWho have ever heard of this? It\u2019s never below zero. \nOur labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. \nBut think of it. GDP below zero. Horrible labor participation rate. \nAnd our real unemployment is anywhere from 18% to 20%. \nDon\u2019t believe the 5.6%. Don\u2019t believe it. \nThat\u2019s right. A lot of people up there can\u2019t get jobs. They can\u2019t get jobs because there are no jobs. Because China has our jobs. And Mexico has our jobs. They all have our jobs. \nBut the real number \u2013 the real number \u2013 is anywhere from 18% to 19% and maybe even 21% and nobody talks about it because it\u2019s a statistic full of nonsense. \nOur enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the day and we as a country are getting weaker. \nEven our nuclear arsenal doesn\u2019t work. \nIt came out recently \u2013 they have equipment that\u2019s 30 years old. They don\u2019t even know if they work. \nAnd I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television because boy does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say \u201cThat is a group of people and that is a nation that truly has no clue. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d \nWe have a disaster called the big lie \u2013 Obamacare. Obamacare. \nYesterday it came out that costs are going for people up 29%, 39%, 49% and even 55%. \nAnd deductibles are through the roof. You\u2019d have to get hit by a tractor \u2013 literally a tractor \u2013 to use it because the deductibles are so high it\u2019s virtually useless. \nIt is a disaster. \nAnd remember the $5 billion website? $5 billion we spent on a website and to this day it doesn\u2019t work. A $5 billion website. \nI have so many websites. I have them all over the place. I hire people. They do a website.

I\u2019m in competition with them. \nThey just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. \nWhen I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. \nThey don\u2019t have to pay interest because they took the oil that when we left Iraq that I said we should have taken. \nSo now ISIS has the oil. And what they don\u2019t have Iran has. \n...And I will tell you this and I said this very strongly years ago \u2013 I said and I love the military and I want to have the strongest military that we\u2019ve ever had and we need it more now than ever \u2013 but I said, \u201cDon\u2019t hit Iraq because you\u2019re going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East. Iran and somebody else will get the oil.\u201d \nAnd it turned out Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq and they\u2019re taking it over big league. \nWe spent $2 trillion in Iraq. $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives \u2013 thousands \u2013 in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers who I love \u2013 I love. They\u2019re great. All over the place. Thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers. \nAnd we have nothing. We can\u2019t even go there. We have nothing. \nAnd every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it. \nLast week I read 2,300 Humvees \u2013 these are big vehicles \u2013 were left behind for the enemy. 2,000!

There\u2019s been no crowd like this. \nAnd I can tell you some of the candidates, they went in, they didn\u2019t know the air condition didn\u2019t work. They sweated like dogs. They didn\u2019t know the room was too big because they didn\u2019t have anybody there. \nHow are they going to beat ISIS?

We don\u2019t have victories anymore. \nWe used to have victories but we don\u2019t have them. \nWhen was the last time anybody saw us beating, let\u2019s say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. \nI beat China all the time. All the time. \nWhen did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions. And what do we do? \nWhen was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn\u2019t exist folks. \nThey beat us all the time. \nWhen do we beat Mexico at the border? They\u2019re laughing at us at our stupidity, and now they\u2019re beating us economically. They are not our friend. Believe me. But they\u2019re killing us economically. \nThe U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else\u2019s problems. \nIt\u2019s true. And these are the best and the finest. \nWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. \nThey\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. \nAnd some I assume are good people. \nBut I speak to border guards, and they tell us what we\u2019re getting. \nAnd it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They\u2019re sending us not the right people. \nIt\u2019s coming from more than Mexico. It\u2019s coming from all over South and Latin America and it\u2019s coming probably \u2013 probably \u2013 from the Middle East. \nBut we don\u2019t know because we have no protection and we have no competence. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. And it\u2019s got to stop. And it\u2019s got to stop fast. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Phoenix, Arizona on July 11, 2015", "text": "When I look at Japan, I just go over from Los Angeles. We had a tremendous crowd there too. We had a tremendous crowd. And we had a big one in Las Vegas this morning. \nBut when I look at these massive boats, I\u2019ve never seen boats like this \u2013 the biggest boats with cars coming from Japan. And then we can\u2019t sell corn. We can\u2019t sell beef. It\u2019s peanuts. We can\u2019t sell beef. \nSo we do about 20% to their 100%. \nSo I said it in an idea on the way over. I said, \u201cTell Japan that\u2019s okay. Everything\u2019s fine. We\u2019re going to cut your orders down to 20%. Let it match.\u201d Let it match. Simple deal. Simple deal. \nAnd I had another idea that\u2019s also very simple. When Mexico \u2013 and you remember when Fidel Castro took over, the opened his prisons and he sent everybody over to the United States and we accepted them and it was hell. We didn\u2019t send them back. We accepted them. \nIn a much, much, much more sophisticated way, Mexico is doing that to us because why would they want to have a prisoner like these two horrible people that hurt so badly \u2013 destroyed \u2013 but hurt so badly the Shaw family and Kate\u2019s family. Why would they want to have them in jail for 40 years, paying for it? \nSo I had an idea...The one with Kate came over five times. In my opinion, he was pushed out by Mexico. They don\u2019t want him. They don\u2019t want to take care of him. Why would they want to take care of him? \nAnd believe me, Univision, which I\u2019m suing by the way for $500 million because they broke the contract, but Univision is doing the work of the Mexican government. \nAnd I don\u2019t blame them actually. I respect Mexico. I don\u2019t blame the Mexican government. I just wish our people were smart. \nLike they\u2019re really smart doing that. They\u2019re sending them to us and we\u2019re either putting them in jails or letting them go free, which is even worse. \nBut we have to do something. So, I have an idea. I said every time an illegal comes to this country through the border because Mexico was pushing them over, remember that. And by the way, unbelievable people are coming. A lot of people that are illegal are great people. \nJust let\u2019s get it straight \u2013 they don\u2019t want to give it straight because the press are liars. They\u2019re terrible people. They\u2019re terrible people. Terrible. Not all of them but many of them. \nSo here\u2019s an idea. So, Mexico is sending them. And by the way, they\u2019re coming from all over the world including the Middle East. Why not? Come on in. We\u2019re stupid. We\u2019ll take care of you. We\u2019ll pay. Get sick, we\u2019ll take care of your hospitalization. What kind of a plan do you want? \nSo I had an idea. I think it\u2019s good. Every time Mexico really intelligently sends people over, we charge Mexico $100,000 for every person they send over. \nNow, they make so much money that that\u2019s peanuts. It\u2019s not a lot. Could have made it much higher but I\u2019m nice. I\u2019m in a good mood today. \nWe charge Mexico $100,000 for every person. You\u2019ll see that it\u2019ll start to stop because that starts to add up. It starts to add up. \nWe have to secure our borders. We have to do something to take back our country. \nI mean, don\u2019t kid yourself folks, what took place today, even by the dishonest press, what took place today is being seen all over the world. Look at all those cameras back there. This is being seen all over the world. People know. \nYou know, it\u2019s a term I haven\u2019t heard for years but I was thinking about it...It\u2019s a term that I haven\u2019t heard for years but I really think it applies now more than maybe ever before and that\u2019s the term \u201cthe silent majority\u201d. Have you all heard that? \nYou don\u2019t hear it. When people start cutting up their credit cards at Macy\u2019s and won\u2019t go to Macy\u2019s anymore, when all of these things \u2013 and that\u2019s a big story but nobody wants to write it. That\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t care about me. \nBut when you see the kind of power that the silent majority has and the silent majority is a problem. They want to go out. They want to lead a good life. They want to work hard. They want to have their family. They don\u2019t want to be involved in coming here and waiting on a line for hours and hours and coming in and listening to Trump. \nBut the silent majority is back, and we\u2019re going to take the country back. And we are going to make America great again! \nThank you. Thank you. Thank you! \nOkay? And I said this in 2004. \nOkay, now Bush goes in and he makes a mistake. And then Obama \u2013 frankly, we might as well have stayed there \u2013 but he made a mistake too. \nAnd I said, \u201cKeep the oil.\u201d Do you remember that? And everyone said, \u201cYou can\u2019t keep the oil. This is a sovereign country. You can\u2019t keep the oil.\u201d \nI said, \u201cKeep the oil. We\u2019re in there now. You blew it. You shouldn\u2019t have gone in.\u201d \nAnd every other candidate is fleeing. They\u2019re all trying to say, \u201cWell, they didn\u2019t know. There was intelligence that said this.\u201d \nThey all said \u201cDo it.\u201d I\u2019m the only one that said no. \nI\u2019m the only one that said \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cKeep the oil,\u201d I said. I\u2019ve been saying this for two, three years. \u201cDon\u2019t leave. Keep the oil. Because if you don\u2019t get it, Iran will get it or somebody else is going to get it.\u201d \n...Iran is taking it and ISIS has it. And ISIS now is building a hotel in Iraq. They\u2019re competing with me. Can you believe it? They\u2019re renovating this building; they\u2019re building a hotel. They\u2019re wealthy. They have the oil. \nAnd I said, \u201cKeep it.\u201d And great criticism. \u201cTrump says keep the oil. Well, that\u2019s a sovereign country. Isn\u2019t it a horrible thing to say?\u201d \nThese are stupid people we have leading us. \nSo ISIS, believe me, I would take them out so fast, it would be \u2013 have to do it, have to do it. \nSee, I think they overplayed their hand. I actually think they made a big mistake. \nWhen they started, like you take James Foley. So great. Such a great guy. I got to know his parents...I met the parents; they\u2019re very interesting... \nThey did the beheading and then they\u2019ve done other \u2013 I said, \u201cYou know, they\u2019re making a big mistake, ISIS, because if they wouldn\u2019t have done and if they wouldn\u2019t keep doing, we wouldn\u2019t have cared. We could have been gone. But you can\u2019t, not when you see what they\u2019re doing, you can\u2019t.\u201d \nHad they not done those things, the level of violence \u2013 we\u2019re like living in Medieval times. You know, when you hear of Medieval time, you always think we were all civilized. It\u2019s a jungle. It\u2019s horrible out there. \nBut when they started doing the beheadings, they really \u2013 I think they made a mistake but not with Obama because he\u2019s weak and he\u2019s ineffective and he\u2019s not respected. Not respected. \nSo here\u2019s the problem. Here\u2019s the kind of deals we make: \nJames Foley is dead. Great guy. Amazing guy. Amazing parents. \nWe have Sergeant Bergdahl, a traitor. \nSo we negotiate for Sergeant Bergdahl, a no-good traitor. Six people were killed trying to find him. Six young in this case men went out to try to get him; six of them never came back. Six people died and we have Sergeant Bergdahl. \nAnd here\u2019s our deal. This is just like the stupid deal that we\u2019re making with Iran on nuclear. This is just like everything else we do \u2013 the deals we make with China, the deals we make with Mexico. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. \nSo we get Bergdahl, a no-good traitor. Frankly, I\u2019d re-negotiate deals every once in a while. Not too often but I\u2019d send him back, and if they don\u2019t want him, send him back anyways. I want to re-negotiate that. \nThey get five killers that are right now back on the battlefield, trying to kill everybody, including the people in this room. And these were the five people that they most wanted. \nSo I call Obama the five-for-one President. Who would make that deal? Now, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because he\u2019s a bad person...Who would make a deal like this? \nBut these are the same deals that we make with all of these countries. \nI\u2019ll tell you one other thing and we\u2019re going to wrap it up now, but I\u2019ll tell you something. And this will be surprising to a lot of people. \nThousands and thousands of people work for me. Tens of thousands. I\u2019ve give tens of thousands \u2013 I\u2019ve taken care of education, for families. I\u2019ve taken care of health care at the highest level. I didn\u2019t even have to worry about Obamacare because my people do better. My people got lucky but I got lucky too \u2013 they\u2019re great people. \nBut ISIS will be in such trouble. Oh. ISIS. ISIS, believe me, they will be in such trouble. \nYou know the problem \u2013 have to say this. So we\u2019re fighting wars and we\u2019re backing all these stupid people that \u2013 honestly, I don\u2019t say they\u2019re stupid. They don\u2019t care. Like the Iraqis. They don\u2019t \u2013 they have no love for the country. \nThe leadership \u2013 there is no leadership but let\u2019s assume there is \u2013 they\u2019re all thieves. They\u2019re all terrible people. 100% corrupt. \nSo we send to one of our so-called allies 2,300 Humvees. Now, think of it. Normally, you\u2019d send like three. How many are here? We send three. \nThey\u2019re armor-plated Humvees. You can imagine what they cost. They don\u2019t even report because it\u2019s probably so high that it\u2019s another scandal like the $500 billion website for Obamacare, which never worked and still doesn\u2019t work. \nSo we send 2,300 Humvees. One bullet is fired in the air, and the people we gave the Humvees to flee and the enemy takes them over. And they\u2019re better than the ones that our boys and women have. Because they were the best, they\u2019re gone in one day. \nRemember Yemen, how we had the victory? The big victory? It turned out to be a false victory because a few months later it was gone. \nIf you think that those people \u2013 if you think that they want Yemen, take a look at a map with that long beautiful border along Saudi Arabia. They want the oil. \nDo you remember what I said \u2013 and I get a lot of credit for this. They said, \u201cHe\u2019s the one guy\u201d \u2013 and I\u2019m a very militaristic guy \u2013 \u201cbut he\u2019s the one guy that said don\u2019t do Iraq because you\u2019ll destabilize it and then Iran will take over and then somebody else worse than than Saddam Hussein will take over the rest. \nISIS \u2013 hey, Saddam Hussein was never as bad as these people. These people are brutal. They\u2019re chopping off everybody\u2019s heads, especially if you happen to be Christian. They chop off your head. They dunk people with a cage. Did you see that? They dunk them and drown them. \nThese people make Saddam Hussein look like a choir boy. \nAnd by the way, I\u2019d hate to say this. I\u2019ve been given many, many environmental awards. I get a lot of environmental awards. But we have to take back the heart of our country. \nWe have to do something special. We have to bring back \u2013 and let me tell you, in bringing back our military, in bringing back our military, we have to do something else. We have to take care of our veterans because our veterans are treated like their third-class citizens and they are the greatest. \nNow, if you remember a few days ago, Bush was asked the simplest question \u201cWas Iraq a good thing or a bad thing?\u201d He couldn\u2019t give an answer. Took him five days before he said it was bad. \nNow, think of this. Think of this. Five days. How can you have a guy like that negotiating for you? Five days it took him and finally he said it was bad. Okay? He could have done it in the first three seconds. But it took him five days. \nAnd if you think about it, we spent $2 trillion, lost thousands of lives \u2013 thousands. We have wounded warriors who I love all over the place. All over. Amazing, I mean, amazing people. So we have wounded warriors all over. We got nothing. \nAnd today, Iraq is meeting with Iran to do some kind of merger. \nSo in 2004, in Reuters \u2013 anyone from Reuters back there? I\u2019m sure they are. There\u2019s an article in July of 2004: \u201cTrump said don\u2019t invade Iraq\u201d. \nNow, I am more for the military and I am the most militaristic person in this room. I would have a military that\u2019s so strong that we would never have to use it because people would say \u201cNo way we\u2019re messing with them. No way we\u2019re messing with them.\u201d \nAnd I\u2019d get along with Putin and I\u2019d get along with China. \nYou know, China \u2013 largest bank in the world is in China. They\u2019re my tenant. I just renewed their lease. Who speaks worse about China than me? No, I do it out of respect. But China, they just renewed their lease. \u201cWe would never move to a build other than your building.\u201d They love it. But it\u2019s called respect. It\u2019s called respect. They respect smart things, smart people, smart deals. They have no respect for our country. \nSo with Bush, if you people go with Bush, you\u2019re going to lose. \nSo let me say Trump is President. Let me say Trump. So I don\u2019t need anybody\u2019s money. Actually, people are setting up PACs all over the place. I don\u2019t care. If they want to give it to me, I\u2019ll take it. Okay? \nBut I don\u2019t need money. I don\u2019t want money. So I\u2019m doing my own. You\u2019ll see that on Thursday or whatever the hell day I file. You\u2019ll see I did really well. Much better than anyone ever thought. Just the opposite. \nSo here\u2019s the story. So Trump is President. So I get a call from the head of Ford and I\u2019ll say, \u201cYou got to build in the United States. Sorry.\u201d He\u2019ll say, \u201cBut Mr. President, really \u2013 we don\u2019t want \u2013 \u201c I\u2019ll say, \u201cHere\u2019s the story. Number one, congratulations on your new plant in Mexico. And number two, we\u2019re going to charge you 35% for every car, truck, and part you send over.\u201d \nAnd here\u2019s what would happen \u2013 here\u2019s what would happen. Now, this isn\u2019t like 99% sure. This is 100%. In fact, you know the negotiators \u2013 the killers that I told you about \u2013 these bad people? I wouldn\u2019t even bother calling them because this is too easy. I can just do this like, you know, with a couple of phones. \nSo here\u2019s what would happen with Trump. I will get some calls. He will say \u201cMr. President, this is terrible. Please! Please!\u201d \n\u201cSorry, can\u2019t do anything. Sorry, I don\u2019t care. I want you to build here. I want jobs in the United States.\u201d \nSo, they would go and they\u2019d call up the lobbyists...Hey, I hire lobbyists. I have lobbyists all over the place. They\u2019re great. I want something \u2013 go do this. I know the system better than anybody. \nI\u2019m a donor. Somebody said, \u201cOh, you gave to the Democrats.\u201d Of course, I give to them. I give to everybody. I want to get everything done. Everybody loves me. Everybody loves \u2013 I give to everybody. \nNow, in a lot of ways, that\u2019s very bad because you know what? That\u2019s bad for the country. You know it\u2019s bad. But that\u2019s the way it works. \nBut I give to everybody; they all love me. They don\u2019t love me so much anymore by the way, I have to tell you. \nBut here\u2019s what happens. He\u2019ll call. I\u2019d say he folds sometimes prior to 5 p.m. in the evening. But he could be tough and he may last \u2019till 12 p.m. the following day. \nAnd he\u2019ll say \u201cPlease\u201d and five guys will call me that are friends of mine and, you know, who I couldn\u2019t care less. I\u2019d say, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. I want that plant built in the United States. I want jobs in the United States.\u201d \nNow, this is just one of many deals. And here\u2019s what happens. I wold probably get a call the first day but maybe the second day because they\u2019re tough negotiators. And he\u2019ll say, \u201cMr. President, would you reconsider?\u201d I\u2019d say \u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019ll say, \u201cMr. President, we\u2019ve decided to build the plant in Phoenix.\u201d Okay? \nIt\u2019s so simple. It\u2019s so simple. We have totally incompetent people. Now, some people say they\u2019re bad people. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re that smart to be bad people. \nHonestly, I mean, a lot of people get angry when I say I don\u2019t think they\u2019re bad; I think they\u2019re stupid; I think they\u2019re incompetent. \nSo we\u2019ve got to take our country back. \nWe\u2019ve got to get rid of Obamacare. We\u2019ve got to repeal it and replace it with something good. \nAnd we have to take care \u2013 and I know this doesn\u2019t sound very conservative \u2013 we\u2019ve got to take care of everybody, not just the people up here. We\u2019ve got to take care of everybody. Okay? Get used to it, conservatives. I love you, conservatives. Get used to it. Let\u2019s take care of everybody, please? \nAnd by the way, Obamacare doesn\u2019t. And if you look at the premiums, the premiums are going through the roof. The deductibles \u2013 frankly, you have to get hit with a Komatsu tractor in order to use them, they\u2019re so high. \nWe can do it. You get rid of state lines. You put it out. You\u2019ll have great care for much less money. The country will spend much less, and we will take care of those people that can\u2019t do it. We have to, we have to, we have to! \nWe have to build up our military. I\u2019m in the real estate business, as many of you have heard. You\u2019ll see that in a couple of days, by the way. I\u2019m in the real estate business and all the time I get listings of bases for sale \u2013 a naval, an army base, a marine. There are all these bases. I said \u201cHow many bases are there?\u201d All the time I\u2019m getting these listings for bases. \nI said, \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d We are hated throughout the world. China is building in the South China Sea islands. We can\u2019t do that because we would not be able to get an environmental impact statement. Can you believe? We\u2019d go through 25 years of being sued by the environmentalist. \nToday, in the Wall Street Journal, big story \u2013 Ford going to build tremendous plants all over the place overseas. \nFord, by the way, speaking of Mexico. Again, I respect them. I wish we had smart people. Ford is building a $2.5 billion plant. Whoever heard of this? $2.5 billion in Mexico! \n...So, I\u2019m saying to myself, \u201cThat\u2019s not good\u201d. \nAnd in addition to that in Tennessee, a big plant \u2013 $1.2 billion \u2013 was going to be built in Tennessee. Wall Street Journal. And all of a sudden at the last moment they decide to go to Mexico. It\u2019s going to be build down in Mexico by a big German car company. \nAnd Tennessee is great and the people were good. They all thought they had it, and at the last moment, it goes to Mexico. \nSo I said to myself, \u201cWow, $2.5 billion. And they\u2019re going to make cars and trucks and parts, and they\u2019re going to send them into the United States, no tax, no nothing.\u201d \nNow, I told you, I went to the Wharton School of Finance. I was like \u2013 I\u2019m like a really smart person. My uncle, Dr. John Trump, was at MIT \u2013 one of the smartest people. Great engineer. Great, like you know, smart. Right? For many years he was at MIT. \nAnd I\u2019m saying to myself, \u201cWhere does this help us for Ford to build a plant in Mexico and then sell \u2013 without tax, no tax?\u201d \nAll that means is one thing \u2013 that we don\u2019t build a plant in the United States, whether it\u2019s in Phoenix or anywhere, because it\u2019s being built in Mexico. \n...So I said to myself, \u201cOkay, Jeb Bush is President and he knows this is the wrong thing.\u201d \nRight now, we have Obama. He won\u2019t call. He doesn\u2019t even call to get our hostages back from Iran. Here we are in the middle of a deal and he doesn\u2019t call about that. One sentence \u2013 I\u2019d say, \u201cBefore we start, we\u2019ve got to get those people back. Used to be three, now it\u2019s four. Get those people back.\u201d They\u2019d be back the next hour. \nWe need the right messenger. The Iran deal is a disaster. The Iran deal is a disaster. They are begging. Our chief negotiator at 73 is in a bicycle race. He falls and breaks his leg. This is the mentality we have. \nSo I said, \u201cWhat would Jeb Bush do?\u201d \nYou\u2019re right. Benghazi. Another Benghazi. To hear our politicians \u2013 John McCain \u2013 two days \u2013 \u201cOh, Benghazi!\u201d You don\u2019t hear about it anymore. Hillary Clinton with the emails \u2013 \u201cOh the emails!\u201d \u2013 two days. \nI\u2019m more disappointed in the Republicans in many ways. They talk and talk and talk. \nSo, Jeb Bush, let\u2019s say he\u2019s President \u2013 ay, ay, ay \u2013 so let\u2019s say Jeb Bush is President. He knows it\u2019s no good to have a $2.5 billion plant built right near our country. How does it help us, right? \nSo here\u2019s what happens. He knows it\u2019s no good. He\u2019ll have a little pressure. Don\u2019t let the plant be built. And he might even say, \u201cDon\u2019t let the plant be built.\u201d Might even call the head of Ford. \u201cThe plant\u2019s not going to be built.\u201d \nAnd then the next day, he\u2019ll be called by special interests that supported him, his lobbyists who push him around like a piece of candy, or his donors who have stock in Ford. And they\u2019ll say, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. I helped you. You can\u2019t hurt them. You just can\u2019t do it.\u201d \nHe folds in about two seconds. \nYou know what we\u2019ve done? For 20 years, I\u2019ve heard the worst thing that could happen would be if Russia or China start uniting. We united them because we did things that were very onerous, because Obama doesn\u2019t like Putin and Putin doesn\u2019t respect or like Obama. \nAnd all of a sudden, Russia and China now are doing all sorts of things together. So we\u2019ve driven them together and I\u2019ve always heard that\u2019s a disaster, and it is a disaster. We have driven them. \nSo, Hillary Clinton was the worst. Now, tell me something \u2013 why? Just tell me why would she be a good President? She\u2019d be terrible. \nWho would you rather have negotiating a deal \u2013 a trade deal \u2013 with anybody? Trump or Hillary? \nWell, we have to get there first. \nSo, who would you rather have negotiating a really good deal with Mexico, China, Japan? Trump or Jeb Bush? \nSo, when I started, I really thought it would be, you know, a long slog, and I was okay with it. I didn\u2019t think that the immigration thing would take on a life like it has. \nI made some very tough statements about people flowing through because that\u2019s one of the things to make our country great again we have to create borders, otherwise we don\u2019t have a country. \nSo it\u2019s one of many things. \nAnd I\u2019ve been very strong. It\u2019s one of many things. We have to make great trade deals and all. \nSo I said strong borders \u2013 one of the things. I said trade deals. Who would do better? \nI\u2019ll tell you what. I know the greatest negotiators in the world. Some are horrible people; horrible human beings. Who cares? Some Wall Street guys, they\u2019re brutal, they\u2019re miserable. You wouldn\u2019t want to go out to dinner \u2013 they\u2019re terrible people. I love them. \nI know the best. I know people that are totally overrated. They\u2019re not good like they think and like the press thinks. \nI know people that you never heard of that are better than all of them. \nI would take one, put him in charge of Japan. Good luck. \nYou know who\u2019s our primary representative right now? Caroline Kennedy. You know how she got the job? 60 Minutes \u2013 she went to the White House. She said \u201cI\u2019d love to have a job. I have nothing to do.\u201d They said, \u201cHow would you like to be the Ambassador to Japan?\u201d She goes, \u201cReally?\u201d \nAnd Abe from Japan, who\u2019s a killer, he\u2019s great. He\u2019s already knocking the hell out of the yen, by the way, which makes it even more impossible for us to compete. And he\u2019s wining and dining her, and I watch it all the time \u2013 wining and dining and just doing a number on our country. \nA friend of mine is a great excavator. That\u2019s what he does. He digs foundations. He digs lots of dirt \u2013 Earth. But he\u2019s a great excavator. Big. And he always bought Caterpillar. \nAnd he calls me up recently and he goes, \u201cI\u2019m a little depressed.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI just put in a big order for machinery, for excavating equipment.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s good. Did you buy Caterpillar?\u201d \u201cNo, I bought Komatsu.\u201d I said, \u201cYou bought Komatsu?\u201d It\u2019s fine. I mean, it\u2019s a well-known brand. I said, \u201cYou bought Komatsu. Why?\u201d He said, \u201cBecause Japan has so devalued the yen\u201d \u2013 brilliant, smart, these are smart people \u2013 \u201cthat it made it impossible.\u201d \n...So he ordered Komatsu instead of Caterpillar. This is happening all over the place. \nThank you Jamiel. So, amazing story. \nBy the way, Jamiel\u2019s sister is here too and she told me the story that when Jamiel saw the boy, saw the boy laying on the sidewalk dead, this incredible young man with such a future, Jamiel laid down on the sidewalk and started pounding the sidewalk with his hand and badly damaged his hand. Badly, badly. He couldn\u2019t understand it. He couldn\u2019t believe it. \nJust an amazing guy. I mean, just an amazing guy. And he wasn\u2019t being heard. He wasn\u2019t being heard. \nAnd the only reason I heard him was because he was talking on a show and he was mentioning how badly they\u2019ve all been treated. \nAnd then you have in San Francisco, a beautiful young woman, Kate, and killed by somebody that just pleaded innocent. First pleaded guilty. Now he has a good lawyer and went into court and pleaded innocent. \nAnd they\u2019ll be playing around with him for about 15 years in court and probably he\u2019ll get off too. \nIt\u2019s a horrible thing that\u2019s going on with our country. \nAnd these are two people that should be alive. And these are people that shouldn\u2019t have been in this country. They flow in like water. \nAnd I love legal immigration. I love it. I love it. I think it\u2019s great. My wife is a legal immigrant. I mean, she went through a whole long process. It\u2019s not easy, and we should maybe make it easier and faster, which I think is fine. \nAnd we\u2019ll have great people come in, and we\u2019ll have them come in from all countries \u2013 Mexico \u2013 everybody, every place. These are great people. \nAnd you know, one of the things that I\u2019ve seen \u2013 because this has been an amazing week \u2013 and you know, it\u2019s been like an incredible week because I thought I was going to be the jobs person because every poll \u2013 CNN did a poll the other day \u2013 I\u2019m killing everybody on jobs. I\u2019m killing everybody on leadership. You know, it\u2019s like funny. You know, I went through these different categories \u2013 the only thing I\u2019m not killing, a lot of people don\u2019t like me. I said what difference does it make. This is about competence. \nSomebody said, \u201cYou win on leadership by far. You win on absolute economic, financial \u2013 anything having to do with the economy. You\u2019re like lapping the field. Much, much higher than anybody else. But they said, but a lot of people don\u2019t know whether or not they like you.\u201d \nI\u2019m actually a nice person. But I actually said if I\u2019m winning in all these categories, why are we even going through primaries? \nHillary Clinton is going to be a horrible President. It\u2019s horrible. If she even wins her own primary, which I don\u2019t know. \nAnd by the way, just so you understand, even then press will say \u201cThis crowd today blows away anything that Bernie Sanders is having.\u201d That I could tell you. \nBut if you think about it, Hillary Clinton was the worst Secretary of State in the history of our country. The worst. The world blew up around her. Our enemies are a disaster and they hate us more. Our friends are all gone. They\u2019re all gone. \nThey\u2019re all sort of like \u2013 we don\u2019t get along with anybody. Everybody is ripping us off, whether it\u2019s Russia or China. \nJamiel Shaw:\nHe went to the mall. I called him up about 7 p.m. He wasn\u2019t home. \u201cHey, where are you?\u201d \n\u201cHey, we\u2019re coming home from the mall. We missed the bus. You know, we\u2019re safe, dad. We\u2019re safe.\u201d \nBecause he knew that\u2019s all I was \u2013 I said, \u201cMake sure to call me. I would have came and got you.\u201d \nSo I started calling him an hour, calling him an hour. I said, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d \nHe said, \u201cRight around the corner, old man.\u201d You know, that\u2019s what he called me. \nAnd I was like, whew. I felt really good inside. I thought, \u201cWhew, he made it home.\u201d \nYou know, I live in LA. You know, so, he had a little brother \u2013 eight-years-old. He got his clothes on. We were getting ready to go get some track spikes. He had a track meet that Friday. This was Sunday night. \nSo you know, a couple of minutes later, gunshots. I mean, really loud, really crispy. So I knew. Oh my God, it was outside my house. \nCalled his cell phone. Didn\u2019t answer. Man, I knew. I went outside and looked down the street. There he was laying on the street dead. \nYou know, I couldn\u2019t believe it. \nEven right now when I say it, you know, I don\u2019t believe it. \nYou know, he was laying there with his eyes closed towards the house. Looked like he was sleeping. Looked like he was sleeping. But his body \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen a dead body before \u2013 and his body was obvious. He was dead. \nAnd I remember, you know, it\u2019s hard situation to go through. \nAfter all that, I found that the guy who killed him was illegally in the country. Come on. You know, that\u2019s \u2013 I thought somebody black did it...Found out that the guy was on his third gun charge. \nNow, you have somebody illegally in the country on their third gun charge. He\u2019d been arrested three times already. He\u2019s in jail again. \nAssault with deadly weapon. Battery on a peace officer. They gave him eight months in the county jail. Eight months. Let him out four months early. \nNow, this was 18th Street gang member in the gang database. He\u2019s been arrested twice for gun charges, stabbed people, put schools on lockdown. Just really violent, you know. And these were the ones that Obama said they wanted \u2013 the violent ones, the gang bangers, the ones with guns. \nHe was released on a Saturday night without any supervision. Sunday night he was in my neighborhood. My son coming home from the mall. You know, he went to my neighbor\u2019s house. That\u2019s why he was in my neighborhood. \nTo make a long story short, he went to my neighbor\u2019s house, knocked on the door; he wasn\u2019t home. On the way back to his car saw my son coming. Ran right over there. He was on the phone with his girlfriend when he heard the guy ask \u2013 well, my son was telling his girl, \u201cOh, something is going wrong. This ain\u2019t right. What should I -\u201d You know that kind of stuff. And she was like \u201cRun, run!\u201d \nIt was too late. \nShe heard the guy say, \u201cWhat sect you from?\u201d \nAnd then he killed him. Shot him in the stomach. You know, one of the neighbors saw it. Shot him in the stomach with a .45. So you can imagine. A .45, a 17-year-old kid, shot him in the stomach. While he was one the ground, pointed to the corner, he had his hands up like this and he shot him through his hands. \nThey thought he had three \u2013 they thought he had three gun shots because his hand was really badly damaged, a bullet wound in his stomach, and one in his head. \nThe coroner said he was on his back, went like this, and he shot him through his hands into his head. \nNow, we hear all the time \u201cMichael Brown. Hands up, don\u2019t shoot.\u201d Now, that was really hands up, don\u2019t shoot. I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t saying anything because he just had a bullet wound in his stomach. \nBut if you could imagine your child \u2013 I tell people all the time when they protest or they protest Mr. Trump, what you have to do is so soul-search. Put yourself in my shoes. Think about your child laying on the street dead. Your mother, your wife, your father, anybody. We\u2019re not designed for that, you know?  Then to find out someone illegally in the country did it. \nSo when I found out \u2013 you know, I\u2019m going to move on to Donald Trump. When I found out Donald Trump was running for office, I watched him because everybody likes Donald Trump. If it had nothing to do with the presidency, you want to see what he\u2019s got to say. \nSo I looked. I saw what he was saying and he was talking about saving the country. \nPeople, my friends were calling me. Liberal friends calling me, \u201cTurn the TV on. Donald Trump is talking about helping America.\u201d \nYou know, I turned it on and I saw it. When I saw it, I was so happy. For the first time in seven years, I feel hope, real hope. You know, I felt real change. You know? \nAnd one thing Donald Trump showed me when he came out aggressive like he did at that, he can weather a storm. You know? We need somebody who can weather a storm. No one else, no one else can lose that kind of money and still be able to do what they\u2019ve got to do. You know what I mean? \nYou know, I tell people all the time: The only difference between me and Donald Trump is that he doesn\u2019t care what\u2019s going on because he had the resources. \nI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t have nothing. I have nothing to lose. You know what I mean? \nSo it\u2019s like a team. You know, they can\u2019t stop us. \nAnd you know, we really got to get him in here. He loves America. You know, I would tell you, I\u2019m serious, if Donald Trump wasn\u2019t a real deal, I wouldn\u2019t have come around him because, you know, my son was murdered, so I don\u2019t trust nobody. \nYou know, I mean, I think everybody, you know, if you\u2019re not against illegal immigration, you\u2019re my enemy. I can\u2019t help that. That\u2019s how I feel. My son was murdered. You have to understand that. \nYou have to understand \u2013 what would you expect from your government? What would you expect from a politician that\u2019s running for office? What would you expect if your son was dead, your daughter, your mother? What would you expect from him? You would expect for him to go out there and fight for us. \nWho do we have? You know, he\u2019s the only one \u2013 he\u2019s the only that\u2019s talking about saving our country. \nAll the Republicans \u2013 we were going to be bamboozled. Donald Trump exposed them all. Because they were all going to say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to save the border\u201d and they did nothing. Now, they\u2019re after him. So what are they going to do for us? Nothing. \nWe have to trust Donald Trump the way you trust your mom, your dad, as you were growing up. You don\u2019t have to believe everything they believe. You don\u2019t have to do whatever they say. But you have to trust them. That\u2019s your mom, that\u2019s your dad. It\u2019s somebody you have to believe in. \nLike I always say when people don\u2019t want to hear what I have to say, ask yourself what would you do if somebody killed your kids? \nAnd the poll just came out and I\u2019m tied with Jeb Bush. And I said, \u201cOh that\u2019s too bad. How can I be tied with this guy? He\u2019s terrible!\u201d \nHe\u2019s weak on immigration. You know, the sanctuary cities. Did you know that he had five of them in Florida while he was governor? Can believe this? I didn\u2019t know that \u2013 I just \u2013 five of them. \nHe\u2019s totally in favor of Common Core, meaning your children in Phoenix and other places are going to be educated by bureaucrats from Washington, who for the most part just want to pick up a check. Give me break. And he\u2019s in favor. \nI don\u2019t see him as a factor and I know it\u2019s the Bush name, which you know has gotten us into lots of wars. I mean, in all fairness, not the greatest. But Jeb Bush \u2013 I don\u2019t get it. \nSo when they said, \u201cMr. Trump, you\u2019re in first place.\u201d \u201cOh that\u2019s good.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re tied with Jeb Bush.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s not good. How can I be tied with this guy?\u201d \nBut I\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019m going to bring up a man to just a few words. His son was viciously and violently shot by an illegal immigrant. His son was a star athlete, a star student. He applied to Stanford and many great colleges. He would have been \u2013 he could have gone anywhere. \nAnd I met Jamiel on television about a week ago. I see this guy. He\u2019s mentioning my name. I said, \u201cOh no, not again\u201d because I figured he\u2019s killing me like everybody else. Right? \nMy wife said, \u201cNo, I think he\u2019s saying some really good things.\u201d I said, \u201cI doubt it.\u201d You know, they\u2019re hitting me left, right. \nI said, \u201cI doubt it.\u201d But I turned it up and he said, \u201cThe only man that\u2019s sticking up for us is Donald Trump.\u201d \nThis guy is great, and we were at the news conference with his mother and his sister yesterday and it was one of the most incredible things. \nSo I\u2019d like to introduce to speak a little bit about his son and how incredible his son was and how his son should be here with us. I mean, his son should be alive and he should be in one of the great colleges and he should be maybe someday in the NFL. But he won\u2019t be because an illegal immigrant shot him violently. \nAnd this guy is the best guy. He\u2019s become my friend. He\u2019s been with me for a few days. And just say a few words about your boy. \nJamiel Shaw\nThank you. Just \u2013 my name is Jamiel Shaw. My son was named Jamiel Shaw, II. He was shot dead in the street by an illegal alien or should I say someone in the country illegal. \nAnd he was a good kid. I\u2019m sorry. He was a good kid. He was a good kid. \nHe was \u2013 we thought we did a good job. You know, when he was five-years-old, I started training him to get him ready. My goal was to get him ready for the ninth grade, which was high school. And we know high school football is big time. You know you have to really start early. We were doing the pop warner. We were doing everything. \nAnd I was on his case 24/7. I was one of those hands-on dads like my dad was. He was hands-on. You know, he was hands-on and the belt on. \nYou know, I respected my father. I was scared of him more than I was scared of the police. So I made sure I could do nothing wrong. \nAnd I wanted my son to be the same way. I didn\u2019t want to have to spank him. I want him to do what I say because it\u2019s the right thing to do and he want to make it in life. \nSo we trained, we trained. We got to high school and he just really. It was unbelievable. I was starting to getting scared. It\u2019s too good to be true. You know, he was three time MVP. He was in the eleventh grade. All three years MVP. Player of the Year. All City. \nI\u2019m sure people here know what I\u2019m talking about with their kids went through that kind of stuff. You know the hard work and the sacrifices that the kids have to do. And the parents \u2013 you know, my weekends was his. You know, I had to go and take care of everything. \nSo one Sunday we went to Pasadena at a training clinic for Division I prospects. So he was like wow. He was like, \u201cMan, dad, we did it.\u201d \nSo to make a long story short, on our way home, he asked me if he could go to the mall and of course I didn\u2019t want to. But you know, \u201cAll right, man. What time are you going to be home?\u201d He said \u2013 I said, \u201cWell, be home by 7 p.m.\u201d It was like 3 p.m., you know, still early. \nSo the Mexican government does not care about the border nearly as much as they care about the bad trade deals that the United States is making with Mexico. That\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about. That\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about. \nSo, I just sued Univision for $500 million. \nWith all of that being said, we have to be strong. We have to take our country back. We have to run the country properly. \nSo, I\u2019m going to bring up a man who\u2019s a great man. He\u2019s a great, great guy. I saw him the other day on television. \nDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s okay. You can shout. I wonder if the Mexican government sent them over here; I think so. Because I\u2019m telling you, I tell about the bad deals that this country is making. Mexico \u2013 I respect the country. They\u2019re taking our jobs. They\u2019re taking our manufacturing. They\u2019re taking our money. They\u2019re taking everything, and they\u2019re killing us on the border. And Mexico does not like it. \nSo remember this. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll take our country back very soon. Very soon. \nSo the other day, you know it\u2019s funny, I got a great review for a speech, including my opening speech when I announced I\u2019m running for President. \nIt wasn\u2019t until five days later that people started saying, \u201cOh he said something -\u201c \nWhat they don\u2019t say is they cut it in the middle of the sentence. They cut it. Because those people \u2013 many of them \u2013 not all, some are great \u2013 but many of them are very dishonest people, meaning the press. Very dishonest. Very dishonest. \nI\u2019ll give you one quick example because I want to bring somebody up for a second who\u2019s fantastic. But I\u2019ll give you one quick example. \nI say \u2013 and it\u2019s fairly standards because I believe it strongly \u2013 \u201cThe American dream is dead but I\u2019m going to make it bigger and stronger and better than ever before.\u201d Right? Right? \nSo and I say it usually once during a speech, every once in a while. You know, I don\u2019t use teleprompters like the President and I speak from the heart. \nSo I say \u201cThe American dream is dead but I\u2019m going to make it\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s standard \u2013 \u201cbigger, better, and stronger.\u201d \nOkay, so now I go home and my wife says to me, \u201cDarling, that was such a tough statement.\u201d \nWhat? I turned on the television. \u201cThe American dream is dead.\u201d Period. Cut. I said, \u201cOh, what a horrible statement.\u201d \nThey are so dishonest. They are so dishonest. \nYou know, what I usually do because if you really love this country, you have a very, very hard convincing people what you\u2019re doing is right and that you\u2019re really smart. \nAnd like a lot of us are really smart. I\u2019m like really smart. Went to the Wharton School of Finance. Even then a long time ago, like the hardest or one of the hardest schools to get into. Did well at the school. Came out, made a fortune. Wrote a book called \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d. \nDid everybody read \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d? They say the number one selling business book of all time, which I agree, but I\u2019ll say one of them because if I\u2019m slightly off by two copies, they\u2019ll say \u201cOh, Trump exaggerated.\u201d \n...Wrote many bestsellers. Many. I think 12. \nSo I did a lot of things. But \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d was like the number one selling business book of all time. Great. \nThen I do The Apprentice, became this tremendous hit. NBC was desperate to have it. Forget it. Now, they can put somebody else that lasts. \nOkay. So ready? And then I hear like \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t deserve to be on the same stage with some failed Senators, failed governor\u201d or something. It\u2019s sort of amazing, isn\u2019t it? Isn\u2019t it amazing? \nSo they came to my office and they said, \u201cWe\u2019d like you to do it. So important.\u201d \nAnd by the way, they renewed The Apprentice. It was really very interesting because a lot of people said, \u201cWell, how could \u2013 \u201c at the upfront, they announced The Apprentice, which is good because I always want to be loved, you know? \nLike when I went on dates, if a woman dropped me \u2013 which happened often \u2013 I would always like to say or at least in my own mind that I dropped her. Does that make sense? So what happened \u2013 makes me feel better. \nSo they renewed The Apprentice and I said I\u2019m not going to do it because I\u2019m going to run for President. They didn\u2019t believe me. \nI said, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you believe me?\u201d \n\u201cWhy would you give up a primetime show?\u201d \nMark Burnett calls from \u2013 a great guy. Survivor, Apprentice. Great guy. He really is a wonderful guy and a friend of mine. He calls me, he goes, \u201cDonald, they\u2019re giving you an extension. Nobody turns down an extension.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of it before.\u201d \nI said, \u201cMark, I\u2019m going to run for President.\u201d Nobody believed me. \nThen I run. And the guys, they\u2019re in my office and they said \u201cRun and then by September, we\u2019ll do something.\u201d Do you believe that? Do you believe that? \nAnd I said, well if I don\u2019t do well, I would have done that. You know, why not? You know, if I\u2019m not doing well, if it\u2019s obvious I\u2019m \u2013 there\u2019s a problem. We just went to number one in the polls. \nSo, NBC went nuts. They renewed their show and they don\u2019t have their star and everybody else failed with similar shows. And they\u2019re angry at me. \nSo again, don\u2019t believe the inclusion. They\u2019ve got Rev. Al Sharpton working for them. Okay? He\u2019s actually not a bad guy. He\u2019s a con man. You\u2019d have to understand it. Rev. Al is a con man. You know, tells people \u201cI\u2019m going to picket you if you don\u2019t give.\u201d I mean, this guy is a con man. \nBut I\u2019ve known him for 20 years. He\u2019s fine. You\u2019ve got to understand who you\u2019re dealing with. \nThey\u2019ve got lying Brian Williams. He\u2019s okay. \nThey sent me the most beautiful present a couple of months ago. Hundreds of \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t say the name because I deal with all of them \u2013 but in this case, Titleist. They sent me hundreds and hundreds of Titleist golf balls. Top of the line. They sent them to me...Card \u2013 \u201cFrom your friends at NBC\u201d. A short time later, they say \u201cHe\u2019s not inclusive\u201d \u2013 me. \nI\u2019m more inclusive than anybody. More inclusive than anybody. \nI then get a call. Univision. Now, Univision controls and by the way, believe me. Univision has a certain power. Now, I didn\u2019t know much about Univision. I thought they were very wealthy. They\u2019re actually not wealthy at all. They\u2019re highly over-levered. They\u2019ve got like, I think, $10 billion in debt. They have to do an IPO. \nNow, how stupid is this? They could have waited a couple of weeks, done their IPO, and be done. Instead, they do it early. They couldn\u2019t do it fast enough because you know why? \nIn my opinion, it\u2019s only my opinion, the Mexican government totally tells Univision \u2013 it\u2019s about 80% of their market \u2013 totally tells Univision what to do. Totally. \nSo the Mexican government is not happy with me, to put it mildly. \nBut again, I respect Mexico but their leaders are too smart for our leaders because we have stupid leaders. Okay? \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you, just between you \u2013 just between this little bit of a group \u2013 thank you very much... \nSo I\u2019m walking up the stairs to make a speech and I have Lundgren saying \u201cI\u2019d like to cut you\u201d because he\u2019s going to get some bad publicity, he thinks. \nAnd I walked upstairs and he said, \u201cAnd now the American dream \u2013 \u201c. And I\u2019m still talking to Lundgren, and it\u2019s like a minute and a half before I walk on stage. People said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d And I made a good speech. No notes. No nothing. And everybody was happy. And I just got cut from Macy\u2019s. \nAnd here\u2019s the bottom line on Macy\u2019s. Thousands and thousands of people are cutting up their Macy\u2019s credit card. Thousands. \nThen I get a call from NBC. Now, let me tell you about NBC. No, no, I got to tell you. Hey, look, I love the people at NBC. We had a tremendous success with The Apprentice. And they renewed The Apprentice. \nSee? I give up a lot. You\u2019re going to see how much money I made with The Apprentice come Wednesday or Thursday when I do my filing. Seriously. It\u2019s a very lucrative \u2013 you know, it\u2019s great when you have a big television show. It\u2019s like, you know, you\u2019re a movie star; you get a lot of money. Right? Not that much but a lot. But you\u2019re going to see very impressive numbers. \nSo NBC calls me \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019d like to see you.\u201d \nNow, they don\u2019t care about inclusion. They were talking about inclusion. You know, they write their press release. So, I read this and I say, \u201cThis is incredible\u201d. \nBut they called me and a couple of months ago the head of NBC comes to see me. And the head of NBC\u2019s boss \u2013 I don\u2019t want to mention names because they\u2019re really good people. They\u2019re friends of mine although I\u2019ll probably never speak to them again either. \nAnd you know, the head of NBC\u2019s boss \u2013 that\u2019s Comcast because they own NBC. \nSo I get a call \u2013 the head of reality for NBC, the head president of NBC, and the head of everything \u2013 the head of Comcast. And they come to see me a number of months ago, \u201cPlease do The Apprentice. Please.\u201d They won\u2019t deny it. They won\u2019t deny it. \nI said, \u201cI can\u2019t. I want to make America great again.\u201d \nI\u2019ve done The Apprentice now for 12 years and it\u2019s a great show. For 12 years. There have 14 or 15 copies of The Apprentice. Every one have failed. Every single one. I mean, I could give you names but I don\u2019t want to embarrass people. \nNah, give you a couple of names. \nNo, nice people. Mark Cuban did one called The Benefactor. It was a disaster. Richard Branson did one. Great guy but it didn\u2019t work out. Tommy Hilfiger, who I love. A tenant in my building. Great guy. Didn\u2019t work out. Hiltons did one. \nMartha Stewart did one for us. Did one for Mark Burnett and Donald Trump. Martha Stewart. She\u2019d just got out of the can. No, it\u2019s true. She\u2019s hot as a pistol. You know, they showed her coming out. You know, she\u2019s got the whole thing with the whole outfit that she\u2019s wearing. The whole thing. I said, \u201cWhat a great idea.\u201d \nSo we actually did The Apprentice done by us. It wasn\u2019t even a copy. It was called The Apprentice. Within a couple of shows it was over. It was over. \nSo I must have something, right? I must have. \nSo here\u2019s the story. NBC sees this. I mean, they\u2019re smart people. So NBC comes to my office and they want me to do The Apprentice so badly. And what do I do? I said, \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m going to run for President.\u201d \nAnd I said, \u201cBecause of equal time \u2013 \u201c Now, you know what equal time. Such a stupid law. Obama can go on television all day long and be President and run for office. But if I have a television show, what happens is everybody running for office would have to be able to do The Apprentice. Equal time. \nSo you\u2019ll have a good guy named Rick Santorum. You\u2019ll have all these guys. \nYou\u2019ll have somebody who used to head up Lehman Brothers \u2013 the governor from Ohio. Headed up Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers almost took down the world. He was a managing partner. I think he\u2019s a nice man. I don\u2019t know. But I know if you\u2019re the managing partner of Lehman Brothers, Lehman Brothers almost \u2013 you\u2019re not looking too good. You know. \nBut all of these guys, they would have to be given two hours in primetime television on Monday or Sunday night. I don\u2019t think so. \nMexico \u2013 and by the way. Officially \u2013 and I\u2019ve only said this about 200 times but it never gets reported. I love the Mexican people. I love the spirit of the Mexican people. I love them. \nMany, many people from Mexico \u2013 legal. They went in the old fashioned way. They\u2019re legal. \nMany, many people from Mexico work for me. And over the years, thousands of people \u2013 Hispanics \u2013 have worked for me. And many, many work for me now by thousands. They\u2019re incredible people. \nBy the way, nobody ever says that. Nobody ever says that. They always cut that out. \nAnd I\u2019ll go a step further. I respect Mexico greatly as a country. But the problem we have is that their leaders are much smarter, sharper, and more cunning than our leaders, and they\u2019re killing us at the border and they\u2019re killing us in trade. They\u2019re killing us. \nAnd every once in a while I\u2019ll see a rally and it\u2019s put up by the Mexican government in my opinion. People come in. They\u2019re so perfect. They\u2019re like central casting. And you know how long the rallies last? Like about 12 minutes. They go home. \nBut when you do \u2013 I\u2019ve said this often. It\u2019s very, very hard for a very successful person \u2013 and I\u2019ve heard it from the time I was a little boy \u2013 to run for President or even political office. And I find it and I have headlines everyday. \u201cESPN drops Trump\u201d. \nA friend of mine in Paris called. \u201cOh Don, it\u2019s too bad about ESPN.\u201d You know what they were doing? They rented my golf club for a day. They put up a big deposit. I took their deposit. And then I rented it to somebody else. I made two for the price of one. No, it\u2019s true. \nThen the next day all over the world, \u201cNASCAR drops Trump.\u201d NASCAR. NASCAR. And then friends of mine call up from Europe. Headlines \u2013 NASCAR. \u201cDon, it\u2019s too bad about NASCAR. I feel so \u2013 \u201c You know what that one was? They rented a banquet hall at Trump National Doral in Miami for one evening. I took their deposit \u2013 I took their deposit. And you know what? I just rented it for much more money than they were paying. So it\u2019s two for the price of one. \nYou know, I may make money running for President. It\u2019s very interesting. \nThen all over the place, I hear Macy\u2019s. Now, Macy\u2019s hurts because the head of Macy\u2019s I thought was a great friend of mine \u2013 Terry Lundgren. Nice guy. He called me up, and I\u2019m in New Hampshire and I\u2019m getting ready to go on to make a speech. \nSort of interesting. It\u2019s like 6:30 in the evening, and I get a call from Terry Lundgren of Macy\u2019s. \nAnd the speech is packed. It was a house. It was supposed to be in the house. They didn\u2019t have enough room. They had 300, 400 people and they never thought this was going to happen. They thought there were going to be 30 like this. This is a little larger but the same thing proportionally. \nSo my phone rings \u2013 my cell phone, and it\u2019s Terry Lundgren of Macy\u2019s. And the man on stage is getting ready to introduce me. And he said, \u201cAnd you know, we have Donald Trump \u2013 the American dream\u201d and blah, blah, blah, blah \u2013 everything. And my phone rings during the introduction. I\u2019m going to be going up there like in a minute. \nAnd he goes \u2013 \u201cDonald, hi.\u201d He\u2019s like my best friend. I said, \u201cTerry, what\u2019s your problem?\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re very controversial.\u201d He said \u2013 and I\u2019m supposed to be going up. I\u2019m supposed to make a speech. I got all these people. \nAnd by the way, cameras \u2013 just like all these cameras \u2013 you have all these cameras \u2013 we\u2019re on live television all over the place like we are now. \nAnd he said, \u201cDonald, I had calls from Hispanic people saying they\u2019re going to boycott Macy\u2019s. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d \nI said, \u201cTerry, be tough. They\u2019ll be gone. One day, one day.\u201d \nNow, this is a man I played golf with. I\u2019m with him all the time. I mean, really was, was, was \u2013 you understand \u2013 because I don\u2019t forget things... \nHe said to me, \u201cPlease, please, Donald. Can I cut you?\u201d \nIt\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019m selling ties. And honestly, you know what? They were made in China so I didn\u2019t care that much. I was like screw it. \nThis is absolutely unbelievable. Thank you everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you. \nSo this began as 500 people in a ballroom in Phoenix. And the hotel called us up and they said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do it here. We\u2019re going to be swamped. It\u2019s going to destroy the building. It\u2019s been amazing.\u201d \nAnd outside, sadly, we have thousands of people that can\u2019t get in. So you know real estate. You know real estate. \nI want to thank everybody. You know, last night \u2013 and a lot of you saw it on television \u2013 it was actually carried live \u2013 we had an amazing event and a very sad event. And yet, very beautiful. Because the word is getting out that we have to stop illegal immigration. We have to. We have to. \nWe have a situation that\u2019s absolutely out of control. \nWe have incompetent politicians, not only the President. \nI mean, right here in your own state, you have John McCain. I just hate to see when people don\u2019t have common sense, don\u2019t have an understanding of what\u2019s going on, or perhaps don\u2019t want to know. Maybe it\u2019s campaign contributions. Maybe it\u2019s special interest. Maybe it\u2019s lobbyists. But for some reason, some people don\u2019t get it and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be in office much longer. I really mean that. \nWe are going to make this country so great again. We are going to work so hard. \nAnd I will say this: When we had our event last night, I saw hardened veteran reporters who were crying. You had to see this. People that I\u2019ve known for a long time that I don\u2019t even like \u2013 they\u2019re not good people. \nHow are you doing back there? \nAnd one in particular, tears are streaming down his face and I\u2019m saying \u2013 I don\u2019t believe what I\u2019m seeing. I didn\u2019t think he had a tear in him. \nAnd some of the people that spoke were absolutely amazing. \nOne, their child was killed by an illegal immigrant, shouldn\u2019t have been here. \nAnd this began for me \u2013 it\u2019s very interesting because when I started and when I announced \u2013 don\u2019t forget, everybody said, \u201cHe\u2019s never going to run.\u201d Right? \nThen they said very strongly \u2013 you know, these are very knowledgeable people; they don\u2019t know anything. Then they said, \u201cHe\u2019ll never file his FEC paper.\u201d I filed that two weeks ago. They said, \u201cOh, wow.\u201d \nThen they said, \u201cHe\u2019ll never file his financials because he\u2019s not as rich as people think.\u201d And they get filed during this week. And by the way, some of the other candidates will not be filing from what I hear. Okay? \nAnd when they filed, the number is actually much higher than anybody ever knew. And I\u2019m not saying that to brag. I\u2019m only saying that because that is the kind of thinking our country needs. \nWe need thinking where trade deals with China, with Japan, with India, with everybody. We\u2019re getting ripped. We\u2019re being taken apart piece by piece, slowly. Slowly. \nChina laughs at us. They laugh at our stupidity. They laugh at our incompetent politicians. They have geniuses negotiating for them. We have people who don\u2019t have a clue; they don\u2019t have a clue. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s introductory remarks at the CNN Republican presidential debate", "text": "I\u2019m Donald Trump. I wrote the Art of the Deal. \nI say not in a braggadocious way I\u2019ve made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all of the world. \nAnd I want to put whatever that talent is to work for this country so we have great trade deals, we make our country rich again, we make it great again, we build up our military, we take care of our vets, we get rid of Obamacare, and we have a great life all together. \nThank you. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Jacksonville, Florida", "text": "It is time to cut our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past. \nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing. Just words and just made things worse. \nShe is the candidate of yesterday. It\u2019s going to be really interesting to see what happens to her. \nI wonder. So let me ask you. Let me ask you. \nShe shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run based on the email scandals and all the. \nOkay, so let me ask you this question. I\u2019ve never done this before. \nWill justice be done or not? Will justice be done, yes or no? \nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure anybody knows the answer. They\u2019re protecting her and it\u2019s very unfair. \nSo do you think justice will be done? We\u2019re going to have to see. \nI see the audience like you\u2019re so confused \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Who knows? We\u2019re going to see. \nI\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s very, very unfair to a lot of people. \nAnd you know what? It\u2019s very, very unfair to the FBI, if you want to know the truth. Very unfair to the FBI. They\u2019re out there doing their job and they\u2019re being road blocked. They\u2019re out there doing their job. They\u2019re amazing people and they\u2019re being roadblocked. \nWe are the movement of the future. Our movement represents all American from all backgrounds and all walks of life. \nWe\u2019re asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters of which there are many. \nWe are fighting for every American who believes in truth and justice, not money and power. \nI\u2019ll tell you, we are going to rule the day. This group. We\u2019re going to rule the day. This group and many, many like you. \nEvery place we go, every place we go, the love of this country is incredible. \nThank you, honey. \nWe are fighting for every citizen who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. \nWe\u2019re fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a better future. \nWith your vote, we are just \u2013 can you believe this? \u2013 five days away from the change you\u2019ve been waiting for your entire life. Five days away. \nTogether, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. \nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless you. \nAnd I watched her during the debate meekly talk about ISIS, and I said to her, \u201cYou\u2019ve been here for 30 years, Hillary. You started ISIS. You were Secretary of State when it started. Why are you going to get rid of it? You can\u2019t get rid of anything. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d \nNow she wants to start a shooting war in Syria, in conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia that could very well lead to World War III. \nAnd remember Putin has no respect for her either. Has no respect for her. Doesn\u2019t like her, doesn\u2019t respect her, doesn\u2019t respect Obama and doesn\u2019t like him. \nHillary and her failed Washington establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East. Wars we never win, and now it\u2019s in worse shape than ever before. Wars we never win, folks. \nThey\u2019ve dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe, and they took us, they opened up our borders. You know it\u2019s interesting. We fight for their borders but at home, we have open borders. Try and figure that one out. \nWe fight like hell for their borders. We spent trillions of dollars to do it. But at home, we have open borders. \nAnd they\u2019ve shipped our jobs on top of everything and our wealth to other countries. \nThat\u2019s gonna end very quickly. \nOur jobs are coming back and our companies aren\u2019t leaving. \nAnd if our companies want to leave, there are consequences. If they want to go to Mexico or some other country and build a plant and make air conditioners like Carrier\u2019s doing or build cars like Ford is doing. Ford is moving an entire massive division there, all small car production. \nIf they want to do that, you tell them very nicely, \u201cI\u2019m sorry..\u201d \nYou know, I always joke that I want to make those calls so badly. I don\u2019t want to put anybody in charge of those calls. They\u2019re so easy and they\u2019re short. And our politicians should have done this for years. \nBut you tell them that when you make your air conditioners, your car, whatever it might be, you build in Mexico, enjoy the weather. When that car or that product comes through our very strong border, now it\u2019ll be a very strong border, there will be a 35% tax. \nAnd you know what\u2019s going to happen? Nobody\u2019s going to leave, folks. \nNow the politicians know this but they\u2019re all taken care of by these special interests groups that want that to happen. \nBut there\u2019ll be a 35% tax and nobody\u2019s leaving. \nAnd the ones that do leave, that\u2019s okay too. We\u2019ll make a lot of money. \nBut nobody says it. Does anybody say it like Trump? Right? So simple. \nTo all Americans, I say it\u2019s time for new leadership. \nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. \nWe\u2019re going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan. \nAnd Hillary is raising taxes very substantially. She\u2019s raising your taxes. \nWe\u2019re going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. \nWe will cancel every illegal Obama executive order. \nWe\u2019re going to rebuild our military and take care of our great, great, great veterans. They\u2019ve never been taken care of properly. 22 suicides a day. Not gonna happen. \nWe\u2019re going to take care of our veterans, and I appreciate all the support I get from the military. \nThere\u2019s a big article today on the front page of the New York Times, and they say, \u201cBoy, does Trump have support from the military\u201d. \nAnd by the way and law enforcement, and by \u201cmilitary\u201d, I mean, including big leagues...our veterans, right, you know? \nHow many veterans are here right now? A lot. Big, big story. The veterans, the military, and law enforcement. \nWe\u2019re going to provide school choice, and we\u2019re going to put an end to Common Core. We\u2019re going to bring our education local. \nWe are going to support the great men and women of law enforcement. We\u2019re going to support them. \nWe\u2019re going to save our Second Amendment, which is under siege. \nGreat people. You know, we have the endorsement of the NRA. It\u2019s great. These are great people. The earliest they\u2019ve ever given. \nAnd we will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. So important. So important. \nAnd we\u2019re putting very, very strong language in. It\u2019s going to be submitted the first day I\u2019m in office. \nWhen they come in once, we deport them. When they come in twice, they go to jail for five years. When they come in another one, it\u2019ll be 10 years. \nAnd you know what\u2019s going to happen? Sort of pretty simple. They hear they get caught again, they go to jail for five years. Guess what\u2019s going to happen? They\u2019re not coming back, folks. \nNow our people don\u2019t want to do it. Our weak, weak politicians don\u2019t want to do that. \nA Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. \nWe will end illegal immigration. We are going to stop drugs from pouring into your communities and poisoning our youths and everybody else. And we will deport all criminal aliens quickly from our country. \nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. We\u2019re going to rebuild them. \nOur navy is as small as it...Have you heard this? To me, this is sad. \nAnd then you wonder why China, who\u2019s making a fortune on us. They make our product, they take our money, and they\u2019re fine. I have a great relationship with. I\u2019ve made a fortune with China. The biggest bank in the world is a tenant of mine in New York. China. Biggest bank in the world, from China. \nBut you know what? You know what? They\u2019re building right now a tremendous fortress in the South China Sea. They\u2019re not supposed to be doing it, but they\u2019re doing it because they have no respect for Obama. They laugh at Hillary. They think \u2013 they think that Hillary is a joke. She\u2019s a joke. She\u2019s a joke. \nYou know what? They dream, they dream, they go to sleep at night, these tough leaders, you know they\u2019re tough and smart. They\u2019re smart and really tough. They go to dream at night, they go to sleep, and they dream that Hillary Clinton becomes president. That\u2019s what their dream is. \nI\u2019ve made a lot of money with China. I\u2019m not sure they like the idea of me either. But that\u2019s okay. \nAnd we\u2019ll get along great with China. We\u2019ll get along with China better than now. \nI guarantee they won\u2019t be building forts in the middle of the sea, totally against everything. \nWhat they\u2019re doing is such a big violation but they have no respect for Obama and they no longer respect our country. \nOur navy is the smallest it has been since World War I. \nWe will build the 350 ship navy that our country needs and desires and must have. \nThat means brand new state-of-the-art ships in places like Mayport, right here in Jacksonville. \nI\u2019m honored, and this is a great honor for me, to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. \nI\u2019m also honored to have the greatest temperament that anybody has because we know how to win. \nShe spends a billion dollars. She spends so much money. \nI see these ads. People that know me say, \u201cHow can they say that?\u201d \nNo, we have. You know what? We have a temperament because \u2013 we have a certain temperament. It\u2019s a temperament of knowing how to win. Knowing how to win. \nThe leaders of our country, boy, you talk about temperament. \nAnd interestingly, whether it\u2019s Podesta or Bernie Sanders, Podesta said Hillary has bad instincts. \nAnd I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ve read the things that that he has said about Hillary on the WikiLeaks, and if I were Hillary, I would fire Podesta so fast. He says such demeaning things about her \u2013 she\u2019s got bad instincts. I mean, you\u2019ve read some of the things. It\u2019s incredible. \nYou know, how do you have people working for you and then you have to deal with them? And it was all behind her back. He must be a bad guy. I don\u2019t know him. \nBut to say the things he said about her, she should look at him say, \u201cPodesta, you\u2019re fired.\u201d \nBut she can\u2019t do that. She probably needs him as a witness in the criminal case so she can\u2019t do that. \nOur new foreign policy will put America first. \nHillary brought death and disaster to Iraq, Syria, Libya. She empowered Iran, and she unleashed ISIS. \nYou know, she wants to get rid of ISIS. She\u2019s the one that started it. It came through the vacuum. Now it\u2019s in 32 countries. \nYou see it. You see what\u2019s going on. \nYou know, these characters in the back, they\u2019re very discouraged because all these lines, people with hats on saying, \u201cMake America great\u201d. Buttons, shirts. \nBut big reports about tremendous support from groups that I was not supposed to have as much support from, it\u2019s throwing them a little bit off balance. They\u2019re not happy. They\u2019re not happy. The protected one is not being very well-protected. \nWhen I\u2019m elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program, and we will keep \u2013 we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. Okay? Believe me. Keep them out. \nAnd we\u2019ll build safe havens and we\u2019ll do things over in Syria. We\u2019ll get other countries to pay for it. \nWe have $20 trillion in debt. \nBut we will get the Gulf States. They have a lot of money. They have tremendous money. They\u2019ll pay for it, I promise. Because we have to take care of people. \nBut honestly, we have enough \u2013 have enough problems in this country. \nLook at what\u2019s happening to France. Look at Paris. \nI have a friend every year he goes to Paris every year. I haven\u2019t seen him in a long time. Paris, oh the City of Lights, he used to tell me. For years. Paris. Paris.  \nI see him like a month ago. \u201cHow is Paris this summer?\u201d \n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t go to Paris. Are you kidding me? It\u2019s no longer Paris.\u201d \nHe hasn\u2019t been there in a long time. \nWe\u2019re going to have our country be great again, folks, okay? We\u2019re going to have smartness. We\u2019re going to do it properly. We\u2019re going to do it properly. We\u2019re going to do it through love. We\u2019re going to do it a lot of different ways. But we\u2019re going to have our country be great. \nA Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. \nAnd yes, we will build a great wall! \nAnd Mexico, which is making a fortune with us, just a fortune at the border and through trade deficit. Our trade deficit with Mexico is enormous. Just in case ya \u2013 well, it\u2019s enormous with everybody. Why should they be any different in all fairness? \nMexico will pay for the wall. Okay? Believe me. They will pay for the wall. 100%. They might not know it yet but they\u2019re paying for the wall. \nWe received the first ever endorsement from our I.C.E. and border patrol officers. \nThey tell us the border crisis is the worst it\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s a national emergency. \nThe immigration officers warned in a letter that Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan is the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history, and that it will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives. That\u2019s what they wrote us. \nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed many, many people \u2013 the most dangerous and violent criminals in the world \u2013 to go free because their home countries very intelligently wouldn\u2019t accept them back. \nSo we take a killer, a drug lord, a vicious gang member bring them back to their countries, and then they\u2019d say \u201cTurn that plane around and get them out of here.\u201d \nAnd Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department would say, \u201cOh well, that\u2019s too bad. Well, we\u2019ll accept them.\u201d And they go on our streets and they kill people. \nHillary Clinton supports. And I guarantee you one thing, in four years or eight years, I guarantee you one thing, there won\u2019t be one instance, not one where one of these murderers or drug people or gang members \u2013 not one instance, folks \u2013 where that plane will come back with that person on that plane. I guarantee you that. There won\u2019t be one instance. \nHillary Clinton supports totally open borders. There goes your country. And strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant who was deported at least five times. \nWe will also immediately stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. A disaster. Another disastrous potential deal. \nAs part of our plan to bring back jobs we\u2019re going to lower taxes on American business from 35 % to 15%. \nWe will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations. Billions and billions of dollars. And use that money to support America\u2019s environmental and national infrastructure. \nBy the way, folks, we\u2019re sending billions and billions of dollars. We\u2019re making our companies non-competitive. Other companies throughout the world are killing us and other countries don\u2019t adhere to whatever they\u2019re supposed to do. But we are sending them all this money. \nHere is what we want. We want crystal clean water. We want immaculately clean air... \nAbove that folks, let\u2019s go to town and let\u2019s employ a lot of people. \nWe are going to spend a lot of money in our infrastructure, including the deepening which you need of the harbor at JackPort. Do we all know JackPort? \nWe will become a rich nation once again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. \nIn Chicago 3,715 people have been shot since Jan. 1st. Think of that. Think of that. Almost 4,000 people. 4,000 people have been shot since Jan. 1st. \nNationwide, murders have experienced their largest single year increase in 45 years. \nNow, the press doesn\u2019t tell you that, because the press is guarding Hilary Clinton, and the press doesn\u2019t want you to know the real facts about your jobs, about all of the things \u2013 about our military which is now bogged down in Mosul. \nRemember I said why can\u2019t we ever go in there like quietly and secretly and do the job? Right? Remember I said the element of surprise. \nAnd they came, Oh, what does Trump know about? I know plenty. Believe me. \nThey\u2019re bogged down. It\u2019s a tough situation. \nFour months ago, we\u2019re going into Mosul. \nI kept saying every time I turned the television on, \u201cOh why do they have to say it\u201d. \nWe\u2019re going to get the leaders of ISIS. This is four months. We are going in! Because we believe the leaders of Isis are in Mosul. Four months, three months ago. We are going into Mosul. We\u2019re going to get those leaders. \nThe problem is after we said it the first time within about 12 minutes they were gone. \nWe are led by stupid people. Remember that. Stupid people. Stupid people. \nWouldn\u2019t it be nice if we didn\u2019t talk? We did the job, and you had the news conference a week later \u2013 wouldn\u2019t that be nice? \u2013 to announce good results. These are not god results. \nA Trump administration will work with local and federal law enforcement to end this growing crime wave. It\u2019s very substantial. Every child in America has the right to grow up in safety and in peace. \nWe will also keep you safe from terrorism. \nHillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the country. They will be pouring into the country. That\u2019s above Obama\u2019s unbelievable thousands and thousands coming in. \nHer plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading across your schools and your communities. \nAnd that\u2019s one of the reasons we have all those \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d signs. Okay? Believe me. The women don\u2019t want this. \nAnd by the way, I have to tell you. I think I have tremendous support from women. Tremendous. I think we have tremendous support. \nWe\u2019re going to keep our country safe. \nYou know they say \u201cWell, what will you do for women?\u201d I say start off with keep our country safe. Is that good? Is that a good starter? \nI think we are going to do tremendously with women. \nWe\u2019re doing tremendously with African-Americans. You see that. You see what\u2019s going on. \nWhere did you get those questions? Where did you got them. \n\u201cWell \u2014 I got them, I don\u2019t know where I got them.\u201d \nI\u2019ll tell you what. She should be fired. She should be fired. \nBut much more importantly, Hillary Clinton should be fired. Hillary Clinton. \nBecause Donna Brazile couldn\u2019t answer the questions. She looked like a fool on television. But she couldn\u2019t answer the questions. \nBut you know what was worse? She took the questions and gave them to crooked Hillary. \nAnd that\u2019s cheating, and crooked Hillary instead of saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t accept them we have to report this incident\u201d, she took the questions went in and had good answers for Bernie. \nAt some point doesn\u2019t Bernie Sanders get tired of it? They\u2019re calling him all these names, they\u2019re cheating on him. Doesn\u2019t he tell his supporters to go vote for Trump at some point? Right? \nAnd I haven\u2019t seen one story where Hillary Clinton \u2013 they blame Donna Brazile. A little bit. Very little. \nBut seriously can you imagine if it was me that got those questions? You know what I\u2019ve been saying. They would reinstitute the electric chair, right? Front page news. Front page news. \nShe\u2019s a very dishonest person, probably the most dishonest person ever to run for the office of president. I really believe. I believe that. \nThe Clintons are the sordid past, and someday they\u2019ll start writing about these dishonest people back there. \nSomeday they will ask the question and they will do a front-page headline \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Hillary Clinton report that she got the confidential guarded questions to a debate?\u201d \nAnd someday these dishonest people are going to write a story about it in mainstream media. \nBut we\u2019re the bright future. \nMy contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption. We understand it. \nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words we all have to say. We. All of us. A lot of us. There\u2019s a lot of us. This is a movement they\u2019ve never seen this before in this country. \nThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t want to blow it now, because you\u2019re allowed to vote early. But we don\u2019t want to blow it in Nov. 8th because this is movement like they\u2019ve never seen before. All of them \u2013 even the ones that dislike me, which there are quite a few of those people. But all of them. \nThis is a movement like they\u2019ve never seen in the country. But it will end quickly. It will end quickly if we don\u2019t go out to vote on Nov. 8th. \nSo let\u2019s not let it end. Let\u2019s keep it because we\u2019re going to make America great again, folks. We\u2019re going to make America great again. \nWhen we win on Nov. 8th, we are going to Washington D.C., and we are going to drain the swamp. Right. \nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. They\u2019ve been stolen. \nFlorida has lost one and four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by his lovely wife Hillary. \nAmerica has lost 70,000. Listen to that number. I thought it was a typo. For weeks I have been saying it. 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary backed deal. \nWe\u2019re going to get it back, folks. Don\u2019t worry. \nWe\u2019re living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. It\u2019s what it is. Greatest thing of it. Greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. \nA Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving the state of Florida. I can tell you. Quickly, very quickly. \nThe theft of American prosperity will end. \nAnd we don\u2019t mind that it\u2019s 115 degrees in this room, right? Do we mind? It is hot in this room. But you know what? That\u2019s okay. We lose a couple pounds not the worst thing in the world, right? \nFrom now on, it\u2019s going to be America first. \nA Trump administration will negotiate NAFTA, and we will stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation, and all unfair subsidy behavior, which is a lot.  \nOne of the things that taught us, WikiLeaks, he knew she had a lot of wrong things going on. You know that. That also came out. Obama knew what was going on, by the way. Just in case you didn\u2019t know. He knew. \nThis guy ought to be back in office working. He\u2019s not going to be there very long. Thank goodness. But he ought to be back in the office working. \nWe don\u2019t win anymore as a country. We don\u2019t win with our military. We don\u2019t win on trade. \nThis guy ought to get back to the office and stop campaigning. \nIf we win on Nov. 8th, we will once again have a government of, by, and for the people. \nReal change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. \nIt\u2019s just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive, double digit premium hike. \nWhose got their number yet? Does anybody know? Should I tell you? Do you want me to depress everybody? You\u2019ll just put your head down, start crying, and leave. I won\u2019t tell you. I don\u2019t want to tell you. \nYou know why? Because if I do, you\u2019ll be so depressed. I don\u2019t like people leaving a speech early, crying. \nYou\u2019re not going to like it, folks. \nIn the great state of Arizona though, as an example, premiums are going up more than 116%. \nAnd it doesn\u2019t work. Obamacare doesn\u2019t work. \nI\u2019m repealing it. We\u2019re going to replace it with something so much better and so much cheaper. \nHillary\u2019s going to double up. \nOver 90% of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurers next year. Think of it. Good luck in that negotiation. \nIn Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60%, the Democratic governor has said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Oh, did he take heat. Him and Bill Clinton. \nDid Bill Clinton take heat? He said it\u2019s crazy, Obamacare. He said, it\u2019s crazy. \nThey lied to us. The president lied to us 28 times. He said you can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan. Remember? He kept lying and lying and lying. \nPremiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are leaving, and deductibles are through the roof. \nSometimes $15,000. In other words, you have to spend $15,000 before you start using it. \nObamacare is a total catastrophe. Yet, Hillary Clinton wants to double down Obamacare. She doesn\u2019t want to terminate it. She doesn\u2019t want to get rid of it. She wants to double down, making it much more expensive than it is right now. And it\u2019s right now ridiculous. \nIt\u2019s your number one cost right now. Bigger than your mortgage. It\u2019s bigger than your rent. First time that\u2019s ever happened. \nI\u2019m asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Florida and our country. So important. \nReal change also means restoring honesty to government. \nHillary was given the debate questions in advance by Donna Brazile. \nBy the way, can you imagine if those questions because the dishonest media, among the world\u2019s most dishonest people by the way, it\u2019s not even a big story. Mainstream media hardly covers it. They hardly talk. \nThink about it, she got the debate questions against Bernie Sanders. Probably got the ones against me too but we won that debate very easily. Those debates. We won those debates, and I don\u2019t care if she got them. Except that it shows how dishonest. \nBut think of this, supposing I got the debate questions, it would be front page of the Washington Post. It would be front page of the New York Times. He must immediately withdraw from the race. What he did is disgraceful. \nI\u2019ll tell you what. They don\u2019t even write about it. \nSo, Donna Brazile was fired from CNN. That\u2019s good. \nBut why wasn\u2019t she fired from the DNC? Because what she did was totally dishonest. \nDid you see her on television the other night? She couldn\u2019t answer. Uh well. Where did you get them? Where did you get them? Where did you get them? She\u2019s gone. That\u2019s the question I was asking though. \nCan you imagine 650,000? What do these people do? No wonder nothing gets done in government. 650...I guess you\u2019ll say those 650. Remember the 33? Well, the 650,000. Also the wedding and some yoga, right? \nFinally, it is believed that no less than five foreign intelligence agencies successfully hacked into Clinton\u2019s illegal insecure server, which contained classified information creating an ongoing security threat to the United States. \nThink of what happened to so many people for doing so little by comparison. Think of it. \nHillary Clinton has engaged in a massive, far-reaching, criminal conduct and equally far-reaching cover-up. \nShe created an illegal email server to shield and guard her activity. So simple. So simple. \nShould have happened a long time ago, folks. Now we\u2019re going through phase two which sounds like we\u2019re in phase one. Should have happened in phase one but she was protected by the Department of Justice. \nShe illegally transmitted confidential information and then lied about it to Congress. \nShe illegally destroyed federal records, including 33,000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena. \nAnd she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. Who in this room has gotten rid of a phone and then smashed the hell out of it with a hammer? Anybody? \nRaise your hand, please. Raise your hand...I see one hand over there. I see a hand there. What business are you in? I want to know. No, I don\u2019t want to know. I don\u2019t want to meet him. \nShe engaged in corrupt pay-for-play at the State Department for personal enrichment. \nShe lied to the FBI, and she lied to the American people many, many times. \nRemember she lied 39 times. \u201cI don\u2019t recall. I don\u2019t recall.\u201d Well, those are lies because she recalled every one of them. \nThese are sad events for our country. A high-ranking government official has been caught selling her public office, threatening national security, and engaging in a massive criminal cover-up. \nIf she were to win, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. \nHere we go again with Clinton. You remember the impeachment and the problems. \nShe\u2019s likely to be under investigation for many, many years, also likely to conclude in a criminal trial. \nThis is not what we need in this country, folks. We need somebody that\u2019s going to go to work, to bring our jobs back, to take care of our military, to strengthen up our borders. \nThis is not what we need. It\u2019s going to be a mess, and they say it, they say it. This is going to be a mess for many years to come before they figure it all out. \nWe don\u2019t need that. We need a president that\u2019s going to go in and do the job. \nAnd I just left, by the way, Miami and in leaving I see Air Force One. So I said to myself, \u201cI wonder who that could be?\u201d \nAnd it\u2019s our president and he\u2019s down here campaigning for crooked Hillary. Now, why isn\u2019t he back in the office, sometimes referred to as \u201cThe Oval Office\u201d. Why isn\u2019t he back in the White House bringing our jobs back and helping our veterans? Why? Why isn\u2019t he back working? He\u2019s campaigning every day. \nAnd I actually think, considering that she is under criminal investigation, I think he\u2019s actually got a conflict. \nThank you. \nIn 5 days, we are going to win the great state of Florida, and we are going to win back the White House. \nJust out, a few minutes ago, the new Rasmussen poll has up 3 up right now. 3 up nationwide. \nWe\u2019re leading in Florida. We\u2019re leading in Ohio. We\u2019re leading in Iowa. \nI think we\u2019re leading in North Carolina, which is big. Doing well in Pennsylvania right there. But we are leading all over. \nI\u2019ll tell you what, we are going to have something that\u2019s going to be very special. \nGet out there on Tuesday. Don\u2019t fail. \nWho has already voted, by the way? That\u2019s pretty good. It\u2019s about 82%. Gotta vote. \nWe\u2019re on the cusp of something that\u2019s so amazing. It\u2019s a historic change. \nA transfer of power from a failed political establishment. We\u2019re going to return that power to you, the American people. \nThere is more breaking news that I\u2019d like to share with you right now. \nIt was reported last night that the FBI is conducting a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s pay-for-play corruption during her tenure as Secretary of State. \nIn other words, the FBI is investigating how Hillary Clinton put the office of Secretary of State up for sale in violation of federal law. \nThe investigation is described as a high priority. It\u2019s far reaching and has been going on for more than one year. It was reported that an avalanche of information is coming in. The FBI agents say their investigation is likely to yield an indictment. \nBut just remember, the system is rigged. Just remember that. \nAnd reports also show the political leadership at the Department of Justice is trying to protect Hillary Clinton and is interfering with the FBI\u2019s criminal investigation. \nBy comparison, four-star general, just last week, James Cartwright, highly respected, is in very serious trouble for a doing a tiny fraction of what Clinton did. May go to jail for up to 5 years. Think of it. General Cartwright, last week four-star general respected by everybody, a tiny tiny fraction, may go to jail for now 5 years. \nAnd General Petraeus\u2019s life and reputation has been destroyed for doing nothing. Nothing by comparison to what Hillary Clinton did. \nShe shouldn\u2019t even be allowed to run for the office of president. She shouldn\u2019t be allowed, and that is where the system is rigged. She shouldn\u2019t be allowed. \nIt was also reported that the laptops of Clinton\u2019s top aides, which had been slated for destruction, were not, in fact, destroyed. Good job by the FBI. \nAnd that the FBI has been successfully using them to gather information for their criminal investigation. \nFurther, they have found new emails as part of the 650,000 emails just recently found. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Eau Claire, Wisconsin", "text": "There is no challenge too great and no dream outside of our reach. There is not. \nThere\u2019s no dream outside of our reach. \nDon\u2019t let anyone tell you it can\u2019t be done. The future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics and not the critics. \nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and she\u2019s accomplished nothing. She\u2019s just made things worse. \nShe is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. We are. We are. \nOur movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life. \nWe are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters of which there are many. There are many. \nWe are asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice, not money and power should rule the day for our country. \nAnd I\u2019ve been on the other side and I understand the other side. Perhaps I understand it better than anybody else. \nBut I love our country and I saw what was happening to our country. And I made the right decision because boy, did I become an outsider quickly. That I could tell you. \nWe are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. \nWe are fighting to unlock the tremendous potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a much better future, and it will happen. \nWith your vote, we are just \u2013 listen to this, after all of this time \u2013 one week \u2013 one week. Do you believe it? \nThis started on June 16th. June 16th. \nThank you. Thank you. Thank you everybody. \nI will not disappoint you. That I promise. That I promise. You won\u2019t be disappointed. \nThis great movement started on June 16th of last year and now we\u2019re one week away. Think of it, one week from the change you\u2019re waiting for your entire life. One week away. \nSo on Nov. 8th, go out. Don\u2019t disappoint yourselves, your families. Don\u2019t worry about me. We have to do it. We really have to do it. \nBecause together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. \nGod bless you everybody. Thank you. Thank you. \nWe could have rebuilt the United States with $6 trillion. We could have rebuilt it twice. \nThey dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They have left our borders wide open at home. And they\u2019ve shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. \nTo all Americans I say it is now time finally for new leadership for change. \nThank you. \nIn closing, just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days. \nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. And she is going to raise your taxes substantially. Remember that. \nWe are going to eliminate every unnecessary job killing regulation. \nWe will cancel every illegal Obama executive order. There are plenty of them. There are plenty of them. There are plenty of them. \nWe will rebuild our military and we will take care of our great, great veterans. We\u2019re going to take care of them. They\u2019ve been treated terribly, terribly. Our veterans have been treated terribly. \nThank you. \nWe are going to provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. We\u2019re bringing our education local. \nWe will support the great men and women of law enforcement. That will take place quickly. \n...The National Rifle Association \u2013 NRA \u2013 endorsed me, the earliest endorsement they\u2019ve ever given to anybody running for president. \nWe are going to save our Second Amendment, which is totally under siege. We\u2019re going to save our Second Amendment, folks. \nAnd appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \nHillary wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can\u2019t change, and wants our lives to revolve around Washington D.C. \nI am asking you to dream big, to push for bold change, and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love of this great country. \nI\u2019m tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day when they really mean another decade. America is tired of waiting. \nThe moment is now. \nThere has never been a movement like this in our country\u2019s history. There never will be perhaps. \nBut we have to take advantage of it on Nov. 8th. We\u2019re going to turn things around and rapidly. And rapidly. \nAll we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country. \nHillary has pledged totally open borders. There goes your country. Which truly would mean the destruction of the United States in a true sense. \nThe immigration officers warned in a letter when they endorsed me that Hillary\u2019s plan is \u201cthe most radical immigration proposal in the United States\u2019s history\u201d and that it would \u201clead to the loss of thousands of thousands of lives.\u201d \nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries very intelligently would not take them back. \nThey don\u2019t want to take back murderers, drug lords, gang members. They say no. \nAnd let me just tell you something. They would bring them to their country. Their country would say, \u201cNo, get them out. Bring them back to the United States where your leaders are stupid people. Bring them back to the United States.\u201d \nLet me tell you, that won\u2019t happen whether it\u2019s four years or eight years. That won\u2019t happen once if I\u2019m president. Not once. \nOne such criminal was set free on Hillary\u2019s watch went on to kill a young American girl, a fantastic young woman named Casey Chadwick, you probably read about her. \nThe killer who had already been convicted for shooting a girl in the head previously and who people were begging to incarcerate or send out of our country should have been sent home. Instead he was set free and stabbed in the face and neck 15 different times and stuffed her body in a closet. \nPeople were begging that he\u2019d be sent out. \nWell, we\u2019re going to make America safe again, believe me. \nThat\u2019s one of many. One of many. So many different stories. \nHillary also strongly supports sanctuary cities like in San Francisco, where the incredible Kate Steinle, the incredible woman, was killed in her father\u2019s arms by a five-time deported illegal immigrant. \nA Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. We will deport all criminal aliens, stop the drugs from pouring into our communities, and we will end this long nightmare of violence like we\u2019ve never seen before. \nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. We have no choice. We have no choice. \nThat includes great support for nearby Fort McCoy. \nI\u2019m honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. It\u2019s a great group nobody has like we have, whether it\u2019s law enforcement, the military, the veterans. \nAnd we are going to take care of our veterans, folks. \nOur new foreign policy will put America first. \nHillary brought disaster to Iraq. Just total disaster. To Iraq, Syria, Libya. \nShe empowered Iran and she unleashed ISIS with the great void that was created by the way her and President Obama \u2013 the campaigner. I call him the campaigning... \nInstead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton, where he\u2019s probably now got a conflict in campaigning for her, he ought to focus on bringing jobs back into our country, focus on getting rid of ISIS, focus on lots of other things. \nNow, Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria, a conflict with a nuclear armed Russia that could frankly, for all we know, it could trigger World War III. For what? \nHillary and her failed Washington establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that never end and that we never win. Remember that. They never end and we never win. \nAnd now, the Middle East is in worse shape than ever before. We could have built our country twice. \nA Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we will stand up to foreign product dumping all over, currency manipulation, and all of the unfair subsidy behavior that\u2019s going all over our country. \nMakes it impossible, impossible, for our businesses to compete. They\u2019ll be competing very soon. \nWe will also immediately stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. That will be a disaster. \nAs part of our plan to bring back jobs, we\u2019re going to lower taxes on American businesses from 35% down to 15%. \nWe\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world. \nWe will become a rich nation again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. \nIn Chicago, 3,664 people have been shot since Jan. 1st of this year. Can you believe that? \nThat\u2019s worse than the places you read about and see in the Middle East. These are war zones. \nWe have places that are more dangerous. \nIn Milwaukee, homicides have risen to their highest level in more than 20 years. \nNationwide, murders have experienced their largest single year increase in 45 years. \nYou don\u2019t hear that from the dishonest media. They don\u2019t tell you that. They don\u2019t tell you that. They don\u2019t tell you that. \nThey\u2019re there for one reason. They want to protect certain people like Hillary. It\u2019s getting hard to protect her, fellas. It\u2019s getting very hard. It\u2019s getting very, very hard to protect her. Getting very hard to protect her. She\u2019s out of control. \nA Trump administration will work with local and federal law enforcement to end this growing crime wave. We have a crime wave. \nEvery child in America has the right to grow up in safety and in peace. \nAnd we will also keep you safe from terrorism. \nHillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syria refugees flowing into our country. Who can even believe it? \nHer plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading in your schools and throughout your communities. \nWhen I\u2019m elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. We have no choice. \nAnd we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. \nA Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. \nAnd as I said and as you know, we\u2019re not playing games. Yes, we will build the wall. \nAnd the fact that it\u2019s 110 degrees in this room, I don\u2019t care. Think of it as a sauna. This room was not designed for this many people. Think of it as the sauna and to use the sauna you have to pay money. We get this for nothing. \nWe\u2019ve received the first ever endorsement from our I.C.E. and border patrol officers. First time they\u2019ve ever endorsed. \n16,500 great amazing people. \nThey tell us the border crisis is the worst it\u2019s ever been. You\u2019ve been reading about it. It\u2019s a national emergency. It\u2019s the worst it\u2019s ever been right now. \nYou know, you try and get some stats. They don\u2019t want to give you the stats. \nThe worst it\u2019s ever been right now. Just about as bad as it gets. \nRight now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty or near the brink of poverty. It\u2019s so true. Can you believe it in this country? \n43% of African-American school age children live in poverty. \n32% of Hispanic school age children live in poverty. \nThis is our country. This is unacceptable in America. \nI will fix it. I will fix it. I will fix it. \nI\u2019ve been saying a lot and I\u2019ve been saying and speaking very openly about the inner-cities and saying to the African-American community, the Hispanic community, I\u2019ve been saying \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d It\u2019s such a disaster. What do you have to lose? \nThank you. We\u2019re going to fix it. \nWe\u2019re going to bring back great schools. \nWe\u2019re going to stop the crime. The crime is unbelievable. \nWe\u2019re going to bring back your jobs. \nWhat do you have to lose? We\u2019re going to fix it. \nAs your president, I will go into the poorest communities and work on a national plan for revitalization. We will replace decades of failure with generations of success. We\u2019re going to have generations of success. \nAmerica has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary\u2019s NAFTA. You know about that. One-third of your jobs. \nYou know, we have a highway \u2013 one-way highway right into Mexico and these other countries. They get the jobs. They get the plants. They get the money. We get the unemployments and the drugs. Not a good deal. That\u2019s going to be changed around, folks. Going to be changed around. \nI mean, you listen to this where America has lost \u2013 oh, we\u2019re going to build the wall. Don\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019re going to build the wall. That\u2019s not even close. \nAnd Mexico\u2019s going to pay for the wall and they understand that. They understand that. \nAmerica has lost \u2013 listen to this because it\u2019s impossible. I\u2019ve been saying for two weeks. I just got this stat. For two weeks, I\u2019ve been saying, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a typo. That\u2019s some kind of an error. Can\u2019t be possible.\u201d \nAmerica has lost 70,000 factories. 70,000. I thought they meant 700. I said you have a mistake here. Maybe 7,000. America has lost 70,000 factories because of politicians that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing or they\u2019re controlled by special interests. \nSince China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary backed disaster, we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening to our country. We\u2019re being treated like we\u2019re stupid people. \nWe have leaders that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. We have leaders that don\u2019t have a clue. \nIt\u2019s the single greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened to us. \nHutchinson Technology laid off 411 workers right here and moved their jobs to Thailand. \nHoneywell laid off 974 workers making printed circuit boards in Chippewa Falls. Their jobs \u2013 oh, you won\u2019t be clapping for this. Their jobs went to China. \nThis is a federal problem because Scott and these people have kept so many of these places but they\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s very hard. It\u2019s very hard. Because we don\u2019t fight with our real tools. \nMeaning if you make your products, you want to come back, not going to be so easy. You\u2019re going to pay a nice big fat tax on that product coming in. \nTTM Technologies laid off 166 workers and most of them went into Mexico and other places. \nLots of jobs going to China. Lots of jobs going to Japan. Lots of jobs going to South Korea. And unbelievable numbers of jobs and plants and factories and everything else going into Mexico. \nA Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and we will stop the jobs from leaving Wisconsin. We\u2019ll work with your governor, who\u2019s a great, great governor, and we\u2019re going to stop it. We\u2019re going to stop it. \nThe theft \u2013 and that\u2019s what it is \u2013 of American prosperity will come to a very rapid end. \nFrom now on, it\u2019s going to be America first. \n...[inaudible]\n \n...One of the top Department of Justice officials, the Assistant Attorney General, is a close associate of Podesta. The two met for dinner after Clinton testified about Benghazi and Podesta described him as the man who kept him out of jail. Works for the Justice Department. \nHas our country ever had a situation like it\u2019s going on right now? Have we ever had anything like it? \nThis is a good time to make an important public service announcement because a lot of things have happened over the last few days. \nThis is a message for any Democratic voter who have already cast their ballot for Hillary Clinton and who are having a bad case of buyer\u2019s remorse. \nIn other words, you want to change your vote. \nWisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you\u2019ve made a mistake. \nA lot of stuff has come out since your vote. \nSo if you live here or in Michigan or in Pennsylvania or in Minnesota, those four places, you can change your vote to Donald Trump. We\u2019ll make America great again. Okay? \nShe is not going to make America great. She will never make America great. \nThe Clintons are the sort of past. We are the bright future. And I say we, we, we. \nI\u2019m a messenger. I\u2019m only a messenger. Remember. I\u2019m only a messenger. But you have to say I\u2019m doing a pretty good job as a messenger. But I\u2019m the messenger. \nMy contract with the American voter begins with a plan to restore honesty and accountability to our government. Finally. \nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words we are all here to say. \nWhen we win on Nov. 8th, we are going to Washington D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. \nYou know, I\u2019ve said this before but it was very interesting because when I first heard the statement, I said, \u201cGive me a break. I hate it.\u201d \n...I said it, people went crazy. Then I went to a rally with 18,000 people, I said it, they went totally crazy. And then I said it again and again. This has only been going on for a week and a half, and now I love it. I love this statement. And it is very accurate. It is very accurate. \nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech on foreign policy", "text": "These are my goals as president. I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome. \nThe world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies. That\u2019s what we want. We want them to be our allies. We want the world to be \u2014 we want to bring peace to the world. \nToo much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons \u2013 the power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world. \nTo achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership. \nAgain, many Americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own. \nAmericans must know that we\u2019re putting the American people first again on trade. \nSo true. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy. The jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority. \nNo country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. \nBoth our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours, and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. \nWe will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. \nThe nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. \nI am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down... \nAnd under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs. \nNAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states \u2014 literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. \nAnd I\u2019ve just gotten to see it. I\u2019ve toured Pennsylvania. I\u2019ve toured New York. I\u2019ve toured so many of the states. They have been cleaned out. Their manufacturing is gone. \nNever again, only the reverse \u2014 and I have to say this strongly \u2014 never again; only the reverse will happen. \nWe will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. \nThere will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later. They fire the people. They take advantage of the United States. There will be consequences for those companies. Never again. \nUnder a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country. \nI will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests. I will be America\u2019s greatest defender and most loyal champion. We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are. \nThe world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest. America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker. \nWe will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make America strong again. \nAnd always \u2014 always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make America respected again. We must make America truly wealthy again. And we must \u2014 we have to and we will make America great again. \nAnd if we do that \u2014 and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known. \nThank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. \nAfter I\u2019m elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies. \nIn these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. \nFor instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO\u2019s outdated mission and structure grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism. \nI will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must only fight to win. \nI will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary \u2013 and I mean absolutely necessary \u2013 and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V. \nOur goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. \nWith President Obama and Secretary Clinton we\u2019ve had the exact opposite \u2014 a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy \u2013 one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake. \nAfter losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever, ever before. \nI challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama/Clinton. It has been a complete and total disaster. \nI will also be prepared to deploy America\u2019s economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination. \nOur power will be used if others do not play by the rules. In other words, if they do not treat us fairly. Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me. \nHowever, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. \nA superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq \u2013 very proudly \u2013 saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. \nSadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very, very rich oil reserves \u2013 something it has wanted to do for decades. \nAnd now, to top it off, we have ISIS. \nMy goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. \nThat\u2019s why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. We have to look to new people. \nWe have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in the New York Times or being watched on television. \nFinally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. \nInstead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions. \nThis includes 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and cyber warfare. \nA great country also takes care of its warriors. Our commitment to them is absolute, and I mean absolute. \nA Trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve. And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life. \nOur veterans have not been treated fairly or justly. These are our great people and we must treat them fairly. We must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the Trump administration. \nFinally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests. Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. \nLook at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania \u2014 and this was a horrible time for us \u2014 were attacked, and 17 brave sailors were killed on the USS Cole. \nAnd what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade Organization, which has been a total disaster for the United States. Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaida. We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn\u2019t do it. \nAnd then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Again, the worst attack on our country in its history. \nOur foreign policy goals must be based on America\u2019s core national security interests. And the following will be my priorities. \nIn the Middle East our goals must be \u2013 and I mean must be \u2013 to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. \nWe need to be clear sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy. We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them. \nAnd we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends. \nWe desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests. \nRussia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. \nCommon sense says this cycle \u2013 this horrible cycle \u2013 of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries. \nSome say the Russians won\u2019t be reasonable. I intend to find out. \nIf we can\u2019t make a deal under my administration, a deal that\u2019s great \u2014 not good, great \u2014 for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. It\u2019s as simple as that. We\u2019re going to find out. \nFixing our relations with China is another important step \u2014 and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time. \nChina respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect. \nWe have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly \u2013 and I mean quickly \u2013 to balance. \nA strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China \u2013 better than we have right now. \nLook at what China is doing in the South China Sea. They\u2019re not supposed to be doing it. No respect for this country or this president. \nWe can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. If need be, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to have to happen. \nThe struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more. \nWe must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. We have no idea where these people are coming from. There\u2019s no documentation. There\u2019s no paperwork. There\u2019s nothing. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant. \nA pause for re-assessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse. \nAll you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and Sept. 11th \u2013 one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country \u2013 worse than Pearl Harbor. Because you take a look at what\u2019s happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked \u2014 one of the true great catastrophes. \nAnd then there\u2019s ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won\u2019t tell them where and I won\u2019t tell them how. \n... We must as a nation be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We\u2019re sending troops. We tell them. We\u2019re sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable. And we have to be unpredictable starting now. \nBut they\u2019re going to be gone. ISIS will be gone if I\u2019m elected president. And they\u2019ll be gone quickly. They will be gone very, very quickly. \nSecondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy. \nThe Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what\u2019s happened to us. \nOur nuclear weapons arsenal \u2013 our ultimate deterrent \u2013 has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. And it has to happen immediately. \nOur active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. \nThe Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. \nThe Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991. Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today. These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room. \nAnd what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars, cuts nearly 25% from what we were spending in 2011. Our military is depleted and we\u2019re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming. \nWe will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest, single investment we can make. \nWe will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned \u2013 and I mean unquestioned \u2013 by anybody and everybody. \nBut we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. \nIn this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem. But I do. No one dollar can be wasted. Not one single dollar can we waste. \nWe\u2019re also going to have to change our trade, immigration, and economic policies to make our economy strong again and to put Americans first again. \nThis will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again. So, so important. \nWe need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge. \nWe have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action. \nOur actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and we\u2019re in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won\u2019t even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem.\n\u2028Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country. \nAfter Secretary Clinton\u2019s failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep. Incredible. \nClinton blames it all on a video \u2013 an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie. \nOur ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation. \nAnd, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. \nAnd now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil. \nAnd you know what? We don\u2019t blockade, we don\u2019t bomb, we don\u2019t do anything about it. It\u2019s almost as if our country doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening, which could be a fact and could be true. \nThis will all change when I become president. \nTo our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again. America is going to be reliable again. It\u2019s going to be a great and reliable ally again. It\u2019s going to be a friend again. \nWe\u2019re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies. \nWe\u2019re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. \nOur moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water\u2019s edge. We need a new rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties \u2014 Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies. \nThis is how we won the Cold War and it\u2019s how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president. \nFirst, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam. \nContaining the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world. Events may require the use of military force, but it\u2019s also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War. \nIn this, we\u2019re going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else. \nIt is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been. \n...We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. \nBut this has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us. Remember that. They have to be good to us, no longer one way. It\u2019s now two-way. And remember, us and all we\u2019re doing, they have to appreciate what we\u2019ve done to them. We\u2019re going to help, but they have to appreciate what we\u2019ve done for them. \nPresident Obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic. \nHe supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place. \nIsrael, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity. Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region. \nPresident Obama has not been a friend to Israel. \n-He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we\u2019ve done \u2013 all of the expense and all at the expense of Israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the United States itself.\n\u2028We\u2019ve picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they\u2019re starting to look elsewhere for help. Remember that. Not good. \nFourth, our rivals no longer respect us. In fact, they\u2019re just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don\u2019t take us seriously anymore. The truth is they don\u2019t respect us. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him. \nPerhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One. \nThen amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia. \nIt\u2019s called no respect. Absolutely no respect. \nDo you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to get the Olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth \u2014 fourth place? The president of the United States making this trip \u2014 unprecedented \u2014 comes in fourth place. \nHe should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. \nWe were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times. \nThe list of humiliations go on and on and on. \nPresident Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. \nWe have the leverage. We have the power over China \u2013 economic power \u2013 and people don\u2019t understand it. And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control. \nHe has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies. \nWe\u2019ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do. They do at will. It always happens. \nIf President Obama\u2019s goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job. \nFinally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals. \nSince the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, we\u2019ve lacked a coherent foreign policy. \nOne day, we\u2019re bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians. The next day, we\u2019re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart. Lives lost, massive moneys lost. The world is a different place. \nWe\u2019re a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess. \nWe\u2019ve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before. \nWe left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide. \nWe tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed \u2013 civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted. Horribly wasted. \nMany trillions of dollars were lost as a result. \nThe vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment. \nThey have benefited so much \u2013 so sadly, for us. \nOur foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. No vision. No purpose. No direction. No strategy. \nToday I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy. \nFirst, our resources are totally over extended. \nPresident Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He\u2019s crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. \nOur manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year. \nWe\u2019re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. \nEnding the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength. \nI am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem. I\u2019m the only one \u2014 believe me, I know them all \u2013 I\u2019m the only one who knows how to fix it. \nSecondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and I\u2019ve been talking about this recently a lot. \nOur allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so. \nThey look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. \nIn NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2% of GDP on defense. \nWe have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia. \nThe countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. We have no choice. \nThe whole world would be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully. \nThirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can\u2019t depend on us. \nWe\u2019ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we\u2019ve never seen before in the history of our country. \nHe negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed. Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. And under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon. \nAll of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran\u2019s treatment of our ten captured sailors \u2014 so vividly I remember that day. \nIn negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table. \nWhen the other side knows you\u2019re not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win \u2014 you just can\u2019t win. \nAt the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. You\u2019ve made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place. \nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation. It truly is a great honor. \nI\u2019d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country \u2013 one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace. \nIt\u2019s time to shake the rust off America\u2019s foreign policy. \nIt\u2019s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold \u2013 something we have to do. \nThe direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. It has to be first. Has to be. That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make. \nAmerica first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. \nBut to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back. We have a lot to be proud of. \nIn the 1940s we saved the world. The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists. \nThen we saved the world again. This time, from totalitarianism and communism. The Cold War lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big. \nDemocrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, \u201ctear down this wall\u201d. \nHistory will not forget what he did. A very special, special man and president. \nUnfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. \nIn fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another. They just kept coming and coming. \nWe went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama\u2019s line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. Very bad. \nIt all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy.\n... "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Mobile, Alabama", "text": "But there\u2019s the all time great. \nFirst of all, why aren\u2019t they giving us back our prisoners? \nAnd second, can you believe this? And second of all, the other day it was determined that Iran in a very important section \u2013 maybe the most important, right? \u2013 is going to do their own policing. \nThey are going to police and they are going to tell us \u201cWe swear we\u2019re not building anything.\u201d \nIt\u2019s so sad. It\u2019s so sad. \nObamacare \u2013 we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. \nWe are going to come up with a plan and there are so many different ways. \nYou know, you don\u2019t know this because you don\u2019t think of Obama this way. Do you know who the biggest beneficiaries of Obamacare are? The insurance companies. The insurance companies. \nRemember I told you special interests and lobbyists \u2013 the insurance companies love it. \nWe can have such great plans if we\u2019d get rid of the artificial lines around every state. \nI have a huge company, and when I negotiate, I like get one group. They don\u2019t \u2013 you can\u2019t negotiate. \nSome of the people that own businesses know what I\u2019m talking about. \nThe insurance companies are so protected, they\u2019re making a fortune. We\u2019re going to end that. We\u2019re going to make it so competitive. \nWe\u2019re going to get rid of the artificial barriers. You\u2019re going to get such great plans. \nAnd Obamacare, I mean, you look at what\u2019s happening with your premiums. I mean, look at this. Look at what\u2019s happening. Just take a look at what\u2019s happening to the deductibles. They\u2019re so high, it\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s impossible. \nTrade \u2013 we\u2019re going to fix it. Health care \u2013 we\u2019re going to fix it. \nWomen\u2019s health issues \u2013 we\u2019re going to fix it. \nMy wife came up to me the other day and she said \u201cIt\u2019s really sad because people don\u2019t understand how you cherish women.\u201d \nI will protect women. It\u2019s so important to me. So important. \nAnd I heard some of the other candidates \u2013 Jeb and some of the others the other day \u2013 saying we\u2019re not going to fund various women\u2019s health issues. Can you believe this? \nI said, \u201cThat\u2019s the end of his election.\u201d \nWomen, I don\u2019t think, like that too much. Do we agree? \nAnd he said, we\u2019re not going to fund women\u2019s health issues. A few hours later, he came back and he said he misspoke. Oh, okay. He misspoke. \nBut women\u2019s health issues \u2013 so important. \nWe\u2019re going to end up taking our country. We are going to make it so strong, so powerful, so loved by people again, so loved. \nYou know, one of the problems that we have and you don\u2019t see it tonight but you see it is the tremendous lack of spirit. \nAnd I actually thought that President Obama \u2013 the one thing \u2013 he was inexperienced, he never produced a job. Lots of other things. But I actually thought that he would be a great \u2013 a really great cheerleader for the country when he was elected. I thought that he would. \nAnd he\u2019s really turned out to be a great divider as opposed to a great unifier. Really had. \nAnd you look at Baltimore, you look at Ferguson, you look at St. Louis last night over the last week, you look at all of the things that are happening. We\u2019re sitting on powder kegs. \nThere\u2019s no spirit. There\u2019s no jobs. There\u2019s no anything. \nWe are going to take this country. I am going to be the greatest jobs President that God ever created. I will tell you that. I will tell you. \nYou are going to be so proud. \nYou know, I oftentimes say the American dream is dead but I\u2019m going to make it bigger and stronger and more powerful than ever before. \nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. I am going to make this country bigger and stronger and better. And you\u2019re going to love it and you\u2019re going to love your President. And we\u2019re going to turn this place around and you\u2019re going to be so proud. \nAnd you know our whole theme is make America great again. We are going to make America better than it\u2019s ever been and we\u2019re going to love doing it and we\u2019re going to have fun doing it. \nAnd I just want to thank everybody because this has been really, really special. Thank you. Thank you very much! \nI\u2019m hired. You\u2019re hired! \nSo, I look at the landscape of our country. I look at where we\u2019re going. I look at where we\u2019ve been. \nWe\u2019ve had a horrible number of years. A horrible number of years. \nWe can\u2019t beat ISIS. I watched the general the other day on television, who\u2019s just retiring, which is fortunate. \u201cHow do you think we\u2019ll do against ISIS?\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s going to be very tough.\u201d \nCan you believe this? \nGeneral George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their graves as you listen to this. They\u2019re spinning in their graves. He talks about a hard time. \nAnd I look at what\u2019s going on with the landscape and I get to meet all of the people that I\u2019ve met over the last period of time and I want to tell you it\u2019s been amazing. It\u2019s been really amazing. \nAnd I want to finish up with a couple of little points. \nOne of them is the Ford deal. Right? \nIsrael \u2013 I love Israel. \n...The bottom line on Ford \u2013 I love this story because \u2013 so when I get the call, I say, \u201cNo, no, no. You\u2019re going to build in the United States.\u201d They\u2019re going to say \u201cNo, we don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d I say, \u201cLet me tell you, sir, you\u2019re going to build in the United States.\u201d \nAnd I will be called by people but I will not have any of their money so I don\u2019t care. \nAnd they\u2019re going say \u2013 and I\u2019ll call them in and I\u2019ll say, \u201cListen, here\u2019s the story. You\u2019re building $2.5 billion in Mexico. We\u2019re going to charge you a tremendous little 35% tax.\u201d \n35%. \nAnd that tax is going to be for every car and every part and every truck that comes into the United States. \nAnd here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen \u2013 as sure as you\u2019re standing or sitting \u2013 they\u2019re going to come back to me the following day. I would say the following afternoon. Let\u2019s say 12...And I don\u2019t need Carl Icahn. This one is too easy. And they\u2019re going to come back and they\u2019re going say, \u201cMr. President, what you\u2019re doing to us is terrible. We will build in the United States. We will build the plant in the United States.\u201d \n100%. \nAnd I\u2019ll say the same thing to Nabisco. It doesn\u2019t help us. It doesn\u2019t help us. \nWhen you look at what\u2019s going where Nabisco is closing and so many places are closing, when you look at the kind of money that these countries are making and I\u2019m naming a few \u2013 I mean, so many countries \u2013 we don\u2019t have anything left. We\u2019re running on fumes. We\u2019re running on fumes. \nThere\u2019s nothing here. \nWhen you look at what happens, they\u2019re so much sharper, they\u2019re so much smarter, and we\u2019re not going to have a country left. \nWe need to have our borders. We need to make great deals. \nYou know, the man in the back just shouted Israel. How would you like to be Israel right now? They relied on us. They\u2019re a voice of sanity. They\u2019re great people. And we have a deal that is so incompetent, so bad. \nThink of the deal. We make a deal. Our chief negotiator goes into a bicycle race at 73 years old. He falls, he breaks his leg. That was the good part of our deal. That was the only thing that happened. \nNo, think of it. And I told people last week as I told this last week, I swear to you I will never, ever ride a bicycle at least in a race but I won\u2019t ride one anyways. \nBut we have new thing that just came up in the deal. \nWe know all about the 24 day period, right? \nBut the 24 day period \u2013 that doesn\u2019t start, that clock doesn\u2019t start ticking for a long time. For a long time. \nSo that could be forever. So if they\u2019re doing something, believe me, by the time we get there \u2013 \nWell, you know, it\u2019s sort of interesting...CNN does this big report that came out last week that I was leading in the poll. So it\u2019s a poll. And everybody says why don\u2019t I have a pollster. What the hell do I need a pollster? Everyday I wake up there\u2019s another poll. Right? \nYou know, they pay these guys like $100,000 a month and they can\u2019t function because unless they go and have it vetted with their pollster, they can\u2019t talk. \nAnd I say, \u201cWhy do I need a pollster when everyday there\u2019s a new poll and they give like 30 pages? I don\u2019t have to get a pollster. What the hell do I need it?\u201d \nBut CNN did this very expensive, very well-done poll. It\u2019s only well done because I was leading by a lot...And they had leadership. I was way ahead of everybody. They had actually I was very good in \u2013 you know the thing I\u2019ll be great at...and I\u2019ll do very well at it \u2013 military. I am the toughest guy. \nI will rebuild our military. It will be so strong, so powerful and so great. It will be so powerful and so great that we\u2019ll never have to use it. Nobody\u2019s going to mess with us, folks. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody\u2019s going to mess with us. \nSo, I look at the various things to do with our country. \nAnd by the way, one of them, boy, we\u2019re going to take care of our vets. Right? Right? \nThey did a poll but they did a poll on like who\u2019s one of the most popular with the vets? I was the most popular person. They like me. And I love them. \nBecause you know why? Because for 35 years, these Senators and these \u2013 other than Jeff, of course. I take Jeff. But these Senators, these Congressmen, these people in Washington, including Presidents, they have done nothing for the vets. They have done nothing. And we\u2019re going to take care of our vets. \nBut so they do this poll, and in the poll, I scored really high marks on almost  everything other than \u2013 they thought I wasn\u2019t a nice person. They said who\u2019s the nicest and I was pretty low on that part. And I\u2019m a nice person. \nBut who cares? \nA woman came up to me and she said, \u201cI\u2019m not choosing \u2013 you\u2019re not nice enough to be President.\u201d \nI said, \u201cYou know what? This is not going to be an election based on a nice person. It\u2019s going to be based on a competent person. We\u2019re tired of the nice people.\u201d \nSo, I won on the economy. I won on jobs. I won on leadership by massive numbers. Like massive. You\u2019ve seen it. I won on all these categories. \nI said, \u201cWhy do we need an election? We don\u2019t need an election. These are such important categories.\u201d \nBut I have had an amazing experience because from the time I announced almost \u2013 other than the first week. That was a rough week. They were hitting me. \nBut the press, which is by the way largely very dishonest. I have to say this. The political media \u2013 I actually think that the political media is less popular than Congress. Can you believe it? And Congress has almost no rating. \nAnd in all fairness, \u2018cause look at all those cameras. They\u2019re all live and they\u2019re trying to shut off the camera right now. But you know what? They\u2019re all live. And so many live cameras. \n...But I will say this. The media is very dishonest but there is a certain group that are fantastic people and every once in a while I\u2019ll get an honest story and I love it. I cherish those stories. They\u2019re not often. But I cherish those stories. \n...They really started treating me much better. \nDon\u2019t forget, when I first ran, I said you know it\u2019s amazing. Went to a great school. Excellent student. Smart guy. \nMy uncle was a professor at MIT who was a smart guy. You know, good smart guy. Good family. \nDo we believe in the gene thing? I mean, I do. Right? You know, I do... \nBut then I went out and built a tremendous fortune and great company. I did the Art of the Deal and many books that were bestsellers. The Art of the Deal is one of the biggest selling \u2013 maybe the biggest selling \u2013 business book of all time. \nI did The Apprentice. We love The Apprentice. Tremendous. \nNBC hates me. You know, NBC hates me because they renewed The Apprentice and I said, \u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m not doing it. I\u2019m running for President. I\u2019m going to make the country great again.\u201d \nThey actually came up to my office and the top people \u2013 great people from NBC \u2013 and they said, \u201cPlease, please\u201d...They said \u201cWe had already renewed the show.\u201d They had sold most of the advertising. They renewed the show. \nI said I\u2019m going to run and I\u2019m going to make our country great... \nBoeing does business with China. And they want all of their intel. They want all of their copyrights. They want everything. Otherwise, we\u2019re not buying planes. \nAnd they\u2019re now building big factories \u2013 I don\u2019t blame China. I mean, I respect them. Not angry at them. I\u2019m angry at our leaders for being so stupid. I\u2019m not angry at China. \nAnd Mexico is the same thing. \nYou know, Mexico is the new China. The other day, Nabisco \u2013 Nabisco. Oreos. Right? Oreos. I love Oreos. I\u2019ll never eat them again. Okay? I\u2019ll never eat them again. \nNo, Nabisco closes a plant. They just announced a couple of days ago in Chicago. And they\u2019re moving the plant to Mexico. \nNow, why? Why? Why? \nHave you heard? My favorite story is with Ford... \nSo Ford \u2013 great company. They\u2019re building a $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico. \nNow, they\u2019re closing up places all over the United States. They\u2019re building this massive factory in Mexico. \nSo I went to this great school. I was actually \u2013 you know, I was totally still am really smart. I went to this great place \u2013 the Wharton School of Finance \u2013 hardest school to get into. Even then it was hard to get into. The hardest. But I went to this great business school and I get business. And I fully understand. Really good at this stuff. \nSo they\u2019re building a $2.5 billion plant. They\u2019re going to close up factories in the United States. They\u2019re going to go and build this plant, they\u2019re going to sell cars, they\u2019re going to sell them back to us, they\u2019re going to sell them. Where does that help us? Tell me. Explain. Explain. \nThere\u2019s no tax. There\u2019s no nothing. There\u2019s no nothing. So we\u2019re closing plants here. They\u2019re building this massive plant in Mexico. \nAnother plant. Also another big foreign car company. There was a plant being built. It was all set to get started. They were going to announce it in Tennessee. You read about it. \nAnd this was a couple of months ago. Wall Street Journal. All set to get started. All of a sudden, Mexico took it away. And now it\u2019s not going to be built in Tennessee. It\u2019s going to be built in Mexico. \nSo Ford is building a plant...I give myself this position. And I say \u201cLet\u2019s assume that somebody else becomes President\u201d. Wouldn\u2019t that be horrible? Wouldn\u2019t that be horrible? \nSo let\u2019s assume somebody else becomes President. Let\u2019s assume a very low energy person, very, very low energy. So low energy that every time you watch him, you fall asleep. \n...Yeah, Hillary too. \nSo let\u2019s say Jeb becomes President...Not good. Not good. \nFirst thing\u2019s that\u2019s going to happen \u2013 like I said, your school\u2019s going to hell. People flow over \u2013 but forget about that. So let\u2019s say that Jeb doesn\u2019t want this plant build. \nSo they\u2019re going to call him \u2013 the head of Ford \u2013 and they\u2019re going to say, \u201cMr. President, we want to build it.\u201d He\u2019ll say, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t want it built.\u201d \nThe next day or the next hour, he\u2019s going to get a call from the lobbyists and the special interests and his donors and they\u2019re going to say, \u201cHey Jeb, we gave you $8 million of your $120 million that you raised. We gave you $8 million. We want that thing done. You can\u2019t do that to our people.\u201d \n\u201cOh, well, okay, I\u2019ll approve it.\u201d It\u2019s going to get done. Okay? The plant will get built and that would be it. \nNow, let\u2019s take Trump as President. Okay, is that better? \nHere\u2019s the simple question: Who would you rather have negotiating with China, Japan, Mexico, any other? Trump or Bush? \nActually, ah, what a group. What a group. \nSo you look at China and what they\u2019ve done. And you know, last week and I said this and I\u2019ve been saying bubble for a long time. You\u2019ve been hearing it. \nLast week, they devalued their currency and we\u2019re having a lot of hard times because of what they did. \nAnd when I hear devaluation of the Chinese currency \u2013 you know the word, the sucking action. That\u2019s a sucking like the vacuum cleaner. I hear the sucking action. \nTwo things happen. Two things get sucked out of us. Our jobs and our money. Now, think of it. \nChina sells us our product, takes our jobs, takes our base, does our manufacturing for us, and we owe them $1.4 trillion. \nThat\u2019s like a magic act. I call it the magic act in reverse. We owe them money. \nJapan \u2013 and Japan is back. They have Abe, who\u2019s the new prime minister. And Abe is really smart. I mean, he\u2019s smart. I met him one time. He\u2019s sharp. \nHe\u2019s negotiating against Carolyn Kennedy. Carolyn. \nAnd I was watching 60 Minutes \u2013 I\u2019ll give you guys a plug \u2013 I was watching 60 Minutes and they\u2019re doing a feature on Carolyn Kennedy and she\u2019s very nice. You know why I like her? Because Ivanka Trump likes her. My daughter likes \u2013 anybody that my daughter likes, right? Anybody my daughter likes \u2013 we love Ivanka. \nSo, what happens is that they\u2019re doing a feature and they said \u201cHow did you become Ambassador to Japan?\u201d \nAnd with Japan, the Ambassador is a very important position because we negotiate. You know, you need somebody sharp. We need a killer. Right? A smart killer, not a dumb killer because there are plenty of dumb killers too. \nYou need somebody sharp. \nSo they said \u201cHow did you get the Ambassadorship?\u201d She said, \u201cWell\u201d \u2013 and this is pretty close. You can check it out. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. I wanted a job and I had nothing to do. So I went to the White House and I said, \u2018Could I have a job? Do you have anything for me to do?\u2019\u201d \nAnd they said, \u201cHow would you like to be Ambassador to Japan?\u201d And she said, \u201cReally?\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe she got it. \nAnd then they showed the rest of the show as her being wined and dined by Abe and all of these killers. Wined and dined. She\u2019s being feted at dinner, at this, and lunches and breakfast. She\u2019ll do anything they want. Anything. \nSo I have the smartest, toughest, meanest, in many cases, the most horrible human beings on Earth. I know them all. They\u2019re killers. They\u2019re negotiators. Some are nice people. Very few. Some are nice people. \nBut I will put the meanest, smartest \u2013 we have the best in the world. We don\u2019t use them. We use political hacks, diplomats. We use people that don\u2019t have any business ability. We use people that have never done a job. \n...You know, like as an example, Carl Icahn, did anyone ever hear of Carl? He\u2019s an unbelievably brilliant tough businessman. So I called him. I had dinner with him two nights ago. \nI said, \u201cYou know, Carl, I\u2019m doing pretty well. I\u2019m leading every poll.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing great.\u201d He can\u2019t believe it either. \nAnd I said, \u201cIf I ever get there, I want you to oversee the negotiations with China and Japan.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d He\u2019s like \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d \nRemember when I said somebody has blood come out of her eyes with hatred? Right? Well, he had blood coming out of it; he will do it. He is an unbelievable negotiator. An unbelievable negotiator. \nAnd I know others. I know the best. I know the worst. I know the ones that are overrated. I know the ones that you\u2019ve never heard about or read about that are better than all of them. \nBut Carl\u2019s one of the greats. I mean, he\u2019s very famous. He\u2019s very rich. And he would love to do it. He\u2019d love to give back. \nAnd he knows what\u2019s happening. They\u2019re ripping us. \nSo they send their stuff over here. And actually, somebody the other day said \u201cWhat China has done to the United States is the greatest single theft in the history of the world.\u201d \nIsn\u2019t is an interesting statement? \nWe\u2019ve rebuilt China. We\u2019ve rebuilt China. \nSo you know we have free trade. The problem with free trade is when you have free trade, very important, you need competent leaders. That\u2019s the one problem with free trade. \nI like free trade. I\u2019m a free trader. The problem is you need great negotiators, great leaders. We don\u2019t have that. \nSo we\u2019re getting killed by everybody. I use these three or four countries. We don\u2019t make good deals. Everybody\u2019s killing us. \nSo we will have unbelievable deals. \nA friend of mine is a manufacturer, and he\u2019s trying to do business with China. And what he\u2019s going \u2013 and he\u2019s a great manufacturer. Makes great products. Better than what they did. They don\u2019t want him sending his stuff. \nAnd he calls me and he goes, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s impossible to do business. I can\u2019t get my product \u2013 they\u2019re dumping stuff over here, comes in by the ship load.\u201d \nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. I can\u2019t get my product \u2013 \u201c \nFinally gets a product in there and they charge him a massive tax which they call a tariff because it sounds a little more sophisticated, right? And he calls me. And he goes, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to do business with China.\u201d \nAnd people realized \u2013 and it was a net worth \u2013 and this is not bragging. I\u2019m going to tell you why. Over $10 billion. That\u2019s good, right? Very little debt. Very little debt. \nIn fact, to show you how stupid these people \u2013 it has a line for income and the income was like I think it\u2019s over $400 million a year. Is that good? My son is here. Look at Eric. He could live on that. \nIt says a line \u2013 \u201cincome\u201d and it\u2019s like, you know, varies with different things. But basically over $400 million a year...Is there anybody that would not want to make that much money in one year here? \nWell, with it comes responsibility but I will tell you this. \nThe reason people like what I\u2019m saying is because I want to put that energy \u2013 whatever the hell kind of energy it is \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s screwed up, if it\u2019s good, if it\u2019s genius, if it\u2019s whatever it is \u2013 I know how to do things. \nAnd I\u2019m not going to do \u2013 I don\u2019t care about \u2013 you know, we\u2019re building a great building on Pennsylvania Avenue, right opposite, between, as you know, the White House and the Old Post Office. \nYou know in real estate business slogan \u2013 \u201cAlways get the post office because they were there first.\u201d I got the old post office in Washington, D.C. And I got it from the Obama administration. Can you believe that? Now, that\u2019s call dealmaking. \nOne of the most sought after buildings in the history of the General Services Administration and I got it. And you know what? They did the right thing because we\u2019re doing a great job and we had a great statement. They wanted to make sure it gets done. \nAnd it will be opening \u2013 and here\u2019s a little story. It\u2019s now under budget and ahead of schedule. Do you ever hear that from government? \nAnd we just finished Doral and lot of great jobs. \nAnd my son is here, Eric Trump. And Ivanka. Has anybody ever heard of Ivanka? And I\u2019ll let them run it. I\u2019m not going to let them do any big deals. Just relax, Eric. Just relax. Calm it. \nBut you know what? I won\u2019t care about that company. My whole energy \u2013 who cares? We do a building. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. My whole energy, my whole being is going to be to make our country rich and to make our country great again. \nAnd I mean, it\u2019s my primary \u2013 it\u2019s my aptitude. I\u2019ve always had an aptitude for making money. Some people would say \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d One person said, \u201cMr. Trump, that\u2019s very crass.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cYou said you were going to make the country rich. That\u2019s very crass.\u201d I said, \u201cYou have to understand in order to make our country great, I have to make it rich again.\u201d \nWe\u2019re a debtor nation. He agreed. \n...So I will devote 1,000%. I couldn\u2019t care less about the Old Post Office. I couldn\u2019t care less about any of our stuff. My kids are very good. They\u2019re going to run it very nicely. \nAnd I just want to make this country so great. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. \n...In Alabama, U.S. Steel \u2013 big closure. Or essentially a closure. And I said, \u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d \nAnd I went around. And I said, \u201cAnybody work there?\u201d No, I don\u2019t think so. I hope not. But big closure. \nAnd one of the reasons is China is dumping so much steel into the United States and other countries also. \nBut China \u2013 I love that sign. Look at that, huh? Wow. Wow. Oh, that\u2019s true... \nSo China is dumping tremendous amounts of steel into our country. \nThe government is subsidizing it. It\u2019s almost like they want us to just die. And they have no respect for us. \nAnd again, like Saudi Arabia, like Japan \u2013 I get along with them great. \nYou know, the largest bank in the world is one of my buildings. They pay me rent. They buy apartments. They spend so much money. Am I going to dislike them? I love them. \nThe problem is and I say it all the time. Their leaders are really smart. They\u2019re really cunning. They\u2019re really sharp. And we have dummies. Right? We have dummies. We have dummies. We have people that don\u2019t have a clue and I don\u2019t know. You know, some people say they\u2019re bad people. Well, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re bad people. I think they\u2019re incompetent people. A lot of people think they\u2019re bad. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re bad. I think they\u2019re incompetent. \n...I said it the other night \u2013 my second favorite book of all time \u2013 what\u2019s my first favorite book? The Bible. The Bible. \nAnd as much as I love the Art of the Deal, it\u2019s not even close. We\u2019d take the Bible all the way, right? \nSo, I was saying. So they said I wasn\u2019t going to run. And everybody said, \u201cOh, he\u2019s never going to run. Never going to run. He\u2019s just having fun. Just a good time. His brand \u2013 \u201c Like I care about my brand. At this point, my brand \u2013 \nI mean, I lose gutless Macy\u2019s because I said about illegal immigration. They dropped my brand. They\u2019re not supposed to be \u2013 they\u2019re gutless. They\u2019re all gutless. \nI have to sue Univision. Univision \u2013 my poor Miss Universe people \u2013 these beautiful women \u2013 some are girls \u2013 but beautiful women and I get dropped. \nThink of it. You have these magnificent women who worked all their life to be in the Miss USA contest and the Miss \u2013 and two weeks before the contest, NBC and Univision dropped because they thought my tone was a little bit strong. \nAnd it turned out I was right. \nSo here\u2019s the good news. I sued them both. \nAnd I mean, in the case of Univision, I sued them for $500 million. I want that money. I want that money. \nSo I actually put it on the other day \u2013 Miss USA \u2013 I put it on because it was only fair to the people. And we had it in a small network and it was fun. But who would do that? All because they want to be so politically correct. \nThey actually called and said, \u201cOh, we\u2019ll get it back on soon. We\u2019ll get it back on soon.\u201d \nYou know, in a case of a couple, they said \u201cTrump loses NASCAR\u201d. It was all over the world. A friend of mine called. You know, because I opened with a strong statement, meaning illegal immigration \u2013 we\u2019ve got to solve the problem. \nSo all over. One day it was NASCAR. \u201cTrump loses NASCAR.\u201d I said, I don\u2019t have a deal with NASCAR. It turned out that I lost NASCAR \u2013 you know what they did? They rented a ballroom at Trump Doral. Can you believe it? That was my loss. They had a ballroom. And by the way, I kept their deposit and rented it to somebody else. \nThe next day \u2013 I didn\u2019t even know I had a deal with them. It turned out they had in one of my places. They\u2019re out. \nThe next day \u201cESPN severs ties with Trump\u201d. It\u2019s all over the world. ESPN \u2013 I have friends that called me. He\u2019s a great business. \u201cOh, it\u2019s too bad about what happened to ESPN.\u201d You know what it was? A golf outing at one of my courses in Los Angeles. Can you believe it? This was my big deal. \nAnd this was all over the world. \nI mean, the press. I don\u2019t know. Maybe they didn\u2019t get it. Maybe they don\u2019t get it. \nI was very disappointed though with Macy\u2019s. You know, shirts and ties. It\u2019s not a big deal. \nBut they heard they were going to be three pickets in front of the store and they called \u201cOh, we\u2019re going to have pickets. We\u2019re going to have pickets.\u201d \nI said, \u201cLook, in two hours they\u2019ll be gone. Believe me, they\u2019ll go for lunch. They won\u2019t come back. Don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s true.\u201d \nBut they said, \u201cOh this is so bad. Can we sever ties?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t care \u2013 sever ties. I don\u2019t wear ties so much any more, you know.\u201d \nI didn\u2019t like the ties that much anyway. You know why? Because they were made in China. It always drove me nuts. True. But they were good. They were good. \nBut I just hate gutless people. \nAnd so the reason that we\u2019re getting this receptivity, which is like this all over the place, is because I filed papers and they said I\u2019m never going to run. Then they said I\u2019m not going to sign the big document, which is a one-page document which basically you\u2019re giving your life away and I signed. \nAnd then they said \u201cOh, I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d The pundits \u2013 you know, they get paid a half a million dollars a year to sit there and make jerks out of themselves, right? Call them pundits. Some are great. Some are really incompetent. I could the ones but they\u2019re starting to get nicer to me so I think I can\u2019t. \n...But what happens is they said \u201cHe\u2019ll never file his financials. He\u2019ll never file because he\u2019s probably not as rich as people think.\u201d \nI said, \u201cActually, one of the reasons I want to run is because I want to file my financials because they\u2019re so good.\u201d Because it\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. \nSo I have like about 102 pages or 98 pages of stuff and they have all these boxes \u201cover $50 million\u201d, \u201cover $50 million\u201d. And I filed my financials and they were phenomenal. They were phenomenal. Much better. \nYou know, right now we have a problem where North Korea\u2019s getting frisky. Right? \nNow, recently I ordered 4,000 television sets. I\u2019d like to order them from here. Like the hats made in America. Can you believe it? I was able to find a guy. I had to do that because you know these hats are hot as a pistol. You know that. And they\u2019re made in America. \nAnd I\u2019m going to give you your book. Believe me, I haven\u2019t forgotten about you. \nBut they\u2019re made in America. \nBut the other day and now I see today it\u2019s sort of pretty hot on the news that our very dear friend North Korea is acting a little bit rambunctious again. \nSo, I ordered 4,000 television sets from South Korea, whether it\u2019s Samsung or Sharp or LG or any of them. They\u2019re all made in South Korea. I paid a fortune and they\u2019re wonderful. And they\u2019re wonderful people. \nThey\u2019re making a fortune. \nWe don\u2019t \u2013 do we have anybody who makes television sets in this country? I almost like don\u2019t think so, right? \nSo they\u2019re mostly made \u2013 other than Sony, which has lost its way, prices are too high \u2013 but they\u2019re mostly made in South Korea. \nSo now I see North Korea is acting up. So I see that we are sending ships and we\u2019re getting our troops ready. We have 28,000 troops over there. \nAnd we\u2019re getting ready just in case...We\u2019re going to fight, we\u2019re going to protect. We get nothing. We get nothing. What do we get? We get nothing. \nSaudi Arabia \u2013 and I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much. \nBut you know, Saudi Arabia makes $1 billion a day. A day. That\u2019s \u2013 in all fairness, that\u2019s before the oil went down a little bit. But that\u2019s okay. These are minor details. \nBut, let\u2019s say they were, let\u2019s say they\u2019re making a half a billion [$500 million] a day. That\u2019s not so bad, right? \nWe get nothing. And they wouldn\u2019t be there without our protection. \nEven Germany \u2013 Germany\u2019s a power. Who has a Mercedes Benz? Anybody? A lot of people. They\u2019re a power. They pay us nothing. \nWe defend the whole world. \nAll you have to do \u2013 and we want to be nice. \nSomebody said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s like the mafia defense.\u201d I said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, okay? The mafia\u2019s not so stupid.\u201d All right? \nThey said, \u201cThat\u2019s terrible to ask for money.\u201d No, they said it. They said that\u2019s terrible. \u201cHow can you possibly ask for money to defend a country?\u201d \nI mean, tell me, tell me, how crazy are we? \nNow, we\u2019re sending our ships, we\u2019re sending our everything. We got \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you what. Those 28,000 troops that we have right now on the border between North and South Korea. That\u2019s dangerous territory. They\u2019re in harm\u2019s way. They\u2019re in harm\u2019s way. And we get nothing. We get nothing. \nOther than they\u2019re a good competitor. I mean, they compete with us. They take our trade. We lose a fortune with them. We lose a fortune with China. \nWe defend Japan. \nYou know, we have an agreement with Japan where if somebody attacks Japan, we have to come to their rescue. But if we get attacked, Japan doesn\u2019t have to help us. \nDo you think that\u2019s a good deal? \nThat\u2019s sort of like Sgt. Bergdahl. Has anybody heard of Sgt. Bergdahl? The traitor. No, no, the traitor. \nI call President Obama the five-for-one President. \nWe get Sgt. Bergdahl, a traitor, who by the way six people at least that we know of, six people were killed trying to get this guy back. Six people \u2013 they went after him. They wanted to get him back. \nSo we get Sgt. Bergdahl and they get five people that they desperately wanted for years that are right now back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody including us. \nHow stupid are we? How stupid are we? \nAnd you know, the reason we have crowds \u2013 and no matter where I go \u2013 the other night, we\u2019re in New Hampshire, we had some \u2013 New Hampshire was so incredible. The crowd. You saw it. \nYou know, every time I go on television it\u2019s got to be live. It\u2019s live. I said, \u201cOh, can I have a rest please?\u201d \nTonight it\u2019s live on Fox. Who likes Fox? I like Fox. It\u2019s live on CNN. Who likes CNN? \nAnd it\u2019s live on MSNBC. \nWell, they\u2019re still working. \nBut I said, \u201cHow come it always has to be live? Why can\u2019t they just cover me like anybody else where they go the next day and they show a little clip?\u201d \nEvery time I speak, it has to be live. It\u2019s ridiculous. But it\u2019s okay. Right? We have to suffer with it. \nBut look, the reason I have this really incredible enthusiasm \u2013 and I really appreciate you especially with this weather and this heat and everything else \u2013 but the reason I have it is because I do know what I\u2019m doing. \nAnd I don\u2019t say that in a braggadocious way. You people are looking for somebody that knows what he\u2019s doing. Whatever it is. \nSen. Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama): \nDonald, welcome to my hometown, Mobile, Alabama. \nThe American people \u2013 these people \u2013 want somebody in the presidency who stands up for them, defends their interests and the laws and traditions of this country. \nWe welcome you here. Thank you for the work you\u2019ve put into the immigration issue. I\u2019m really impressed with your plan. I know it will make a difference. \nAnd this crowd shows a lot of people agree with that. \nCongratulations! Welcome and God bless. \nSo, I go around and I see so many people and I\u2019ve been treated so well by the people. \nAnd you know, we\u2019re leading in every poll. We\u2019re leading in just about every state, including Alabama. Big. \nWe\u2019re leading in Florida. Could you believe it? We\u2019re leading big in Florida. \nAnd you know, it\u2019s really amazing. I said, \u201cWell Florida, I love Florida.\u201d It\u2019s a great place, right? Right. \nBut Florida \u2013 we have a governor and we have a sitting Senator and I\u2019m killing them. How do you explain that? Obviously they\u2019re not doing a very good job because that shouldn\u2019t be happening. \nBut we\u2019re winning in Florida, Pennsylvania, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas. \nAnd then, nationally, we\u2019re just absolutely way ahead of everybody else. \nIn fact, you know, if this were another country, we could maybe call for an expedited election. Right? I would love that. Can we do that? Can we do that? I\u2019d like to have the election tomorrow. I don\u2019t want to wait. \nSo, the reason that I think we see this receptivity is that I know the game better than anybody. I\u2019ve been on the other side. \nYou know, I was totally establishment...Was handing...millions of dollars to these characters all the time, right? I was like the fair haired boy. Do I look fair haired? \nBut I know the game. I mean, I understand it. \nAnd so many people have come up \u2013 lobbyists. I said I don\u2019t want money from lobbyists. \nBut recently, last week, a man comes up who\u2019s a good guy. I know him...I said I don\u2019t want your money. I don\u2019t want your money because I don\u2019t know maybe I\u2019ll rethink it. Should I rethink it? Take it. \nYou know what I should do? How about this? How about if I take his money but in the end, I screw him and don\u2019t do anything for him. Is that okay? Can I do that? \nYou know, because I built a great business and I felt sort of stupid. I say I don\u2019t want your money. \nCan I take it please? I promise I won\u2019t do anything for him. \nI told him, I said, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t want your money because in two years when you come to see me about something I\u2019m not doing it unless it\u2019s good and unless it\u2019s going to make America great again.\u201d Right? Right? \nBut I\u2019m going to have to rethink it. I think I\u2019m going to rethink that because I think I should take a lot of money \u2013 are we allowed to give it to charity or something? I don\u2019t know. Just take it. Just take it. \nSo what happens is these guys come up and I\u2019m lucky. You know, everybody said he\u2019s never going to run. Okay? You know that. Right? \nAnd my wife actually said, \u201cYou know, if you\u201d \u2013 she knows me pretty well and she also sees the reaction and for a long time whether it\u2019s Trump \u2013 The Art of the Deal, which Obama and Kerry obviously did not read when they did this crazy deal with Iran. \nOh, look, the Art of the Deal. Give me that book. I love that book. \nYou know, I said the other day and it sort of played pretty well that is my second \u2013 help her over here \u2013 give me that book. There\u2019s always the Art of the Deal and that\u2019s the real one; that\u2019s the original. That\u2019s when they use real paper right? \nYou know, I said the other day \u2018cause so many people they carry around the Art of the Deal because they\u2019re begging, they\u2019re begging their politicians \u201cPlease, please read the Art of the Deal when you negotiate with China and with Japan and with Mexico and with Vietnam and with Saudi Arabia and with everybody.\u201d \nWow. Wow, wow, wow! Unbelievable! Unbelievable! \nThank you. \nOh, that\u2019s so beautiful. You know, now I know how the great Billy Graham felt because this is the same feeling. We love Billy Graham. We love Billy Graham. \nYou know, this all started, we had a hotel and we were going to have 250 or 300 people. And the hotel was great. They called and said, \u201cSomething\u2019s happening here. We can\u2019t hold this. This is crazy, what\u2019s going on.\u201d \nAnd then we went to the convention center and they could have 10,000 people and we\u2019re all set and we\u2019re excited. And the next day they said, \u201cToo many people. We can\u2019t put them in.\u201d \nSo we came here. We came here. \nYou know, today if you noticed, we have a stock market not doing so well. We have a country not doing so well. We\u2019ve been saying it for a long time. \nWe have politicians other than the few politicians that are with us tonight \u2013 well, exclude them. But we have politicians that don\u2019t have a clue. They\u2019re all talk; they\u2019re no action. \nWhat\u2019s happening to this country is disgraceful. \nAnd you know, when I announced I was running for President, I brought up the subject of illegal immigration. \nAnd I took a lot of heat \u2013 that, I can tell you. \nRush Limbaugh actually said incoming \u2013 \u201cHe got more incoming than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d \nAnd two weeks later, everybody was apologizing to me. They saw that I was right. Between what happened in San Francisco to incredible Kate and her family is such an incredible family, Jamiel [Shaw], and so many people have been so badly hurt. \nThe other day in California last week, a woman 66-years-old, a veteran, was killed \u2013 raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed by an illegal immigrant. \nWe have to do it. We have to do something. We have to do something. \n...You know, if it rains, I\u2019ll take off my hat and I\u2019ll prove once and for all that it\u2019s mine, okay? \n...The people that built this country. That\u2019s what we have here. I mean, the people that built the country. Great people. \nSo we\u2019ll start with a little talk on the illegal immigration \u2013 what\u2019s going on. \nWe\u2019re going to stop it. We\u2019re going to build a wall and it\u2019s going to be. \nYou know, it\u2019s amazing. The politicians 10 years ago, 15 years ago, they all wanted a wall. But it never went. It never happened. Because somebody didn\u2019t want it. Probably a lobbyist. \nYou know, all these guys like Bush and like Hillary Clinton, they\u2019re all taken care of \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you know \u2013 it\u2019s true. \nNo, but when Hillary has $60 million and when Jeb Bush who\u2019s totally in favor of Common Core, weak on immigration \u2013 right? Very weak on immigration. Wants to let people come in. Although now, he is using anchor baby. \nYou know, he put out a memo \u2013 \u201cYou cannot use anchor baby.\u201d Now, because I used it, he\u2019s using it. Politicians. \nBut when they have \u2013 in his case, $114 million \u2013 in Hillary\u2019s case, she\u2019s got $60 million. \nNow, I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s going to make it to the game. What do you think? I\u2019m not sure that she\u2019s making it to the game. \nSome bad things came out today. You know, those classified \u2013 you know the word classified. \nYou know, they\u2019ve destroyed Gen. Petraeus over less and nothing seems to be happening here. \nSo it will be very interesting to see what happens ultimately. \nBut, we have right now and I just got these numbers today. I said \u201cWhat are they?\u201d 7.5% of all of the births in this country are illegal immigrants. Okay? \nCan\u2019t afford it. And they\u2019re supposed to stay. \nNow, I turned out to be right. The 14th Amendment. You know, I had these guys \u2013 \u201cYou can\u2019t change the 14th Amendment. It will take so long.\u201d On that I agree. \nBut you know what? An act of Congress \u2013 the 14th Amendment \u2013 I was right on it. You can do something with it and you can do something fast. You can do something fast. \nSo we have 300,000 babies a year. 300,000 that you have to take care of. We all have to take care of. \nAnd you know, in the case of other countries including Mexico, they don\u2019t do that. It doesn\u2019t work that way. \nYou don\u2019t walk over the border for one day and all of a sudden we have another American citizen. It doesn\u2019t work that way. \nMexico doesn\u2019t do it. Other places don\u2019t do it. Very few places do it. \nWe\u2019re the only place just about that\u2019s stupid enough to do it. \nSo, I decided to run \u2013 I\u2019ve gotten an amazing reception. I have to say, has this been crazy? \nI mean, it\u2019s been wild. I\u2019m a non-politician. The other day, I served jury duty. Right? I told you \u2013 they had \u201coccupation\u201d. I refused to put down \u201cpolitician\u201d. \nBut I will say this: We have a great politician here. We have a man here who really have been \u2013 he\u2019s the one person I sought his counsel because he\u2019s been so spot on, he\u2019s so highly respected. Has anybody ever heard of Sen. Jeff Sessions? \n...Unbelievable guy.

So I would have liked that. But the fact is it could have been the debate. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn\u2019t. But I would have done it exactly the same way because I raised, Scott, we raised in one hour, I raised $6 million for the vets. And I would never, ever give that up to go between first and second in Iowa. Wouldn\u2019t be worth it. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nIf you watch and study and read about various lawyers \u2013 you know, that\u2019s what they do \u2013 they really feel she\u2019s in grave danger and what she\u2019s done is against the law not just against rules. It\u2019s against the law. I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen because I don\u2019t know whether or not the Democrats are going to protect her. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nOkay? \nThank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nIf I had to do it again, I would have done the exact same thing. And the reason is \u2013 you know why? Because I raised $6 million for the vets in one hour. \nSo if I took a second place instead of a first place and could give the vets $6 million, I\u2019ll do that all day long. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nYou look at other people in all fairness \u2013 senators, governors \u2013 they\u2019re, you know, they\u2019re way down. \nWhen I have 25% or 26% and they have 1% but you people don\u2019t mention that. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nNow, you mention the person, Marco, good guy. But he came in third. And they make it sound like he had a victory and I didn\u2019t. But I came in second. \n...I started off on 17th. I was 17th. When I first started, I had nothing. And then I inched my way up \u2013 went pretty rapidly actually. And now I\u2019m leading everything and I did okay in Iowa. Pretty good in Iowa. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nSo, I don\u2019t know why is the third place person doing well and the second place person, who by the way has never run \u2013 Scott was mentioning before \u2013 \u201cOne of the amazing things about you, you\u2019ve never run for office before. It\u2019s incredible how you did.\u201d \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nSo we have \u2013 there\u2019s a good bonding going on. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nThe only \u2013 you know, I\u2019m a businessperson. I want to spend wisely. And I\u2019m probably $40 million under budget because of the fact that frankly I haven\u2019t had to spend very much although I guess we just did a recent filing and I would be probably having spent now maybe $14 million, $15 million. \nBut I\u2019m self-funding. And I must tell you, I don\u2019t know that enough people appreciate it. I\u2019m self-funding anyway whether they appreciate it or not. So I won\u2019t be influenced by the lobbies and you know et cetera, et cetera. \nBut I don\u2019t know \u2013 I was talking to Scott about this before \u2013 I don\u2019t know it\u2019s really appreciated by the voters. I\u2019m the only one on both sides that\u2019s self funding. I\u2019m putting up my own money. And I don\u2019t know that the voters appreciate it. When they go into vote, I don\u2019t think they say \u201cI\u2019m going to vote for Trump because he\u2019s self-funding and he\u2019s not going to be influenced by lobbies and special interests et cetera.\u201d \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI just don\u2019t know whether or not the voters appreciate it. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd I think we did very well \u2013 I think we did really well in just about everything we\u2019ve done running for office. I think we have a very good result yesterday. It could have been a little bit better. It could have been one notch better. \nBut it\u2019s interesting all of these governors and senators that you have way down the list, they\u2019re at 1%, 2%, you know, in terms of what happened \u2013 what just happened \u2013 they\u2019re at 1%, they\u2019re at 2%, they\u2019re 3%. Nobody ever talks about them. And I\u2019m at 24% or 25%, and they say, \u201cOh, couldn\u2019t you have done better?\u201d \nYou know, I think the result was quite good especially for the amount of time I spent and for the amount of money I spent. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nBut I\u2019ve had very good relationships with pretty much everybody. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \n...You know, it\u2019s very interesting. If you look at the numbers from yesterday, I got the highest number in history outside the one number \u2013 in the history of the primary. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nNo, I think we\u2019re going to do really well here. I look forward to it. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nIf you look at South Carolina, it\u2019s the same thing. I mean, we\u2019re doing really well there. But we\u2019ve devoted much more time here and South Carolina \u2013 \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nIn fact, I guess in terms of money per vote, I\u2019m about at the bottom, meaning the most efficient. \nI came in second. I came into strong second. Third, I think, was quite a bit away \u2013 I think 2,500 or something \u2013 close to 3,000 votes away. There\u2019s a big difference between second and third. \nI think we did really well. You know, as far as that\u2019s concerned. \nI think the press \u2013 some of the press said I did fantastically well. Some of the press doesn\u2019t want to give it credit. \nI think we did very well. I didn\u2019t expect to do so well. I guess what did happen is one poll came out and said I\u2019m 4 or 5 points ahead and that maybe build up a false expectation for some people. \nBut it had taken me back to June 16th. I was told \u201cDon\u2019t even go to Iowa. Start right here in New Hampshire. Just don\u2019t waste your \u2013 \u201c \n...I\u2019m going to Iowa. I went. I bonded with the people, bonded with evangelicals. We did really fantastically and came very close to winning. I mean, we came very close to winning. We came in second place. \nSo I am very happy with what happened in Iowa. You know, you had 17 people and I was second. Now, I guess you have 11 people and I was second. And I think we did a very good job.

We are the movement of the future. We are the movement of the future. \nThis is a great movement. This is a movement that\u2019s never happened before ever in the history of our country. Ever in the history, there\u2019s been never anything like it. \nAnd I will say and I understand how this system works. I understand the system, I guess, as well as anybody understands.

I became a serious outsider. \nBut we\u2019re all outsiders and that\u2019s the way we like it. We\u2019re all outsiders. \nBut it\u2019s a movement like it\u2019s never been seen before. And even the dishonest people back there and the pundits, they say \u2013 some of them \u2013 say it\u2019s the single greatest political phenomena that they\u2019ve ever seen in this country. And it is. \nAnd that\u2019s why we cannot do anything that\u2019s going to stop it. We have to get out. \nPennsylvania, you are so important. Everyone talks \u2013 Pennsylvania. If you win Pennsylvania, you\u2019re going to win. Pennsylvania! \nNow, we\u2019re doing great all over this state, and I really believe I\u2019m going to do well in Philadelphia because that\u2019s where I went to school specifically. I love Philadelphia. Don\u2019t disappoint us, Philadelphia! \nWe\u2019ll do great things for Philadelphia. \nBut there\u2019s so much for Pennsylvania that\u2019s so important, and get out Nov. 8th and vote. \nWe\u2019re fighting for every parent who lost their child to gangs and drugs and violence. \nWe are fighting for every community whose jobs have been ripped out and shipped to other countries. \nAnd we are fighting for every American who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. \nI\u2019m asking you to dream big because with your vote and can you believe this? We\u2019re just four days away. You will get the change you\u2019ve been waiting for for your entire lifetime. \nAnd folks, I\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s not going to happen again. It\u2019s not going to happen in four years. It\u2019s over. This is it. He\u2019s just saying it\u2019s it. \nThis is it, folks. In four years, it\u2019s going to be a whole different \u2013 it will never ever happen again. It\u2019s our last chance. Our last chance. \nTogether, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. We will make America great again. \nThank you! God bless you, everybody. Go out and vote. Thank you! \n### \nYou go get them and have the news conference later. Wouldn\u2019t that be nice? \nI always say whatever happened to the element of surprise. \nSo four months ago I heard it. Then three months. Then two months. \nIn the meantime, they\u2019re buried in there. They\u2019re using human shields. \nWe have no choice but to take ISIS out. We have to because they\u2019re chopping off heads. They\u2019re doing things \u2013 when you read the history books, not since the Medieval times has anything like this happen. \nAnd it formed during this period of time of Hillary Clinton. Now, Hillary is saying we will get ISIS. What the hell did she let it start for? \nNow, ISIS is in 32 countries all around the world and what a shame it is. \nWe have people in leadership that are grossly incompetent. We\u2019re going to change it and we\u2019re going to change it fast. Okay? \nI\u2019m honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. \nYou saw that last night. Right near Fort Bragg. Great place. Great people. \nWe had 21,000 people last night. We had more people last night than I have tonight. Although if you include the people outside, we may have them. We may have them. I\u2019m not sure. I think if you include outside, we may have more than that. \nHillary Clinton brought death and disaster to Iraq, Syria, Libya, and she empowered Iran and she unleashed ISIS all across the world. \nHillary and our failed establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that we don\u2019t win and now the Middle East is in far worse shape and far more danger that it ever was before. \nThey dragged us into foreign wars that make us less safe, shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries, and they\u2019ve our borders wide open at home. We\u2019re go into wars and we set strong borders. But at home, we have no borders. \nWe send our troops to foreign countries to defend their borders but our politicians refused to defend our borders. \nThat will change on Nov. 8th. Believe me. That will change. Nov. 8th. That will be a big day. \nA Trump administration will never ever put the interests of a foreign country before the interest of our country. Ever. \nTo the people of Pennsylvania. To all of the people in the United States, I say from now on it\u2019s going to be America first. Believe me. \nTo all Americans I say it is time for change and time for new leadership. We need it. \nWe just cannot have four more years of Obama because that\u2019s what we\u2019re getting if we do this. \nIt\u2019s four more years. It\u2019s ISIS running rampant. It\u2019s no borders. It\u2019s bad jobs. \nYou see the jobs report \u2013 how horrible. You saw what what happened just two days ago. The jobs report was a disaster. And they\u2019re all bad jobs because our good jobs are disappearing. \nIt\u2019s no good folks. Four more years. We can\u2019t have it. \nCan you imagine \u2013 can you imagine? I saw these great men, these great admirals last night. These great generals. These are great people \u2013 strong, smart. I saw these unbelievably brave recipients of the Medal of Honor. \nAnd I say to them, how would you feel to have Hillary Clinton as your leader? And they\u2019re wonderful Americans and I refuse to tell you what they said but it wasn\u2019t good. Believe me. \nCan you imagine? These people taking orders \u2013 these great people taking orders from her? \nWhen they know that \u2013 you what we do? We capture them over and over and over and we let them go. \nThere have to be consequences, folks. There have to be consequences. \nHillary supports totally open borders. There goes your country. And strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant and this immigrant, this illegal immigrant was deported at least five times. \nNot going to happen anymore, folks. \nThousands of Americans would alive today if not for the open border policies of Obama and Clinton. \nThis includes Americans like Josh Wilkerson, whose mother I\u2019ve gotten to know during the campaign. \nJosh was a student in a high school. Good student. Good kid. Everybody loved him. He was murdered at the age of 17. \nHe was tortured, strangled, beaten to death by an illegal immigrant, and then his body was set on fire. Everybody wanted this guy out. They wanted him incarcerated. \nIn July, right here in Pennsylvania, an illegal immigrant with a previous deportation record, horrible record, raped a young child. \nThe illegal immigrant had been arrested for aggravated assault on numerous occasions. But he was set free. He was set free. Everybody that knew him said, \u201cPlease, please don\u2019t set him free.\u201d \nHe was set free by weak, ineffective policy. By weak, ineffective leadership. \nA Trump administration will end this vast nightmare of violence. We\u2019re talking about thousands and thousands of incidents. \nWe will protect American lives. We will cancel all federal fundings to all sanctuary cities. We will stop illegal immigration, deport criminal aliens, and dismantle every last criminal cartel that\u2019s in this country. \nAnd by the way, our local police who are so incredible, they know every one of these people. They know everyone. They have to put up with them everyday. \nWhen we win, you will finally have a government on your side fighting for your community and protecting your family. \nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. We have no choice. \nThat means new resources for the nearby Army War College that will train the next generation of Army leaders. \nNow, Mosul, I talk about Mosul because I can\u2019t believe it. \nFirst of all, we had Mosul. It was the way we got out. Whether you wanted to be in Iraq \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t have been in Iraq. But we had Mosul. It was all done. \nBut then Clinton and Obama did that crazy get out. They got out the wrong way. So they took Mosul back. \nNow, four months ago, I started hearing, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take Mosul. We\u2019re going to take Mosul.\u201d And I say whatever happened to the element of surprise? Right? \nSo we had Mosul but we essentially gave it up. Now, we\u2019re taking it. \nBy the way, just so you understand, I\u2019ve never even said this before. Who benefits by us getting us out? You know who\u2019s going to benefit? Iran. We\u2019re not going to benefit because Iran is taking over Iraq. We handed that back to them along with one of the dumbest deals I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 the $150 billion back. \nThe $1.7 billion in cash that we gave these people. A terrorist \u2013 number one terrorist nation. $1.7 billion in cash and now they feel emboldened and they go and they harass our ships and they take our 10 sailors and humiliate the sailors and humiliate our country. \nNot going to happen with \u2013 he said never happen with you. I promise it will never happen with me. I promise you that. I promise you that. \nBut just to finish...Mosul. We want to go into Mosul. This was four months ago. Because we want to get ISIS leaders. We think they\u2019re in Mosul. \nWell, if you want to get them, you don\u2019t talk about it. Right? You don\u2019t talk about. \nBut they\u2019re not happy. They see the polls. We\u2019re leading in Ohio. We\u2019re leading in Iowa. We\u2019re leading in North Carolina. We\u2019re leading in New Hampshire. We\u2019re leading in Florida. \nAnd I actually think we\u2019re leading in the great state of Pennsylvania. \nI love you people. \nBut they don\u2019t show. Watch. You go home, you won\u2019t see the crowds. They won\u2019t talk about them. \nYou go see Hillary\u2019s, she\u2019ll have like 300, 400 people. What a joke. What dishonesty. \nA Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. \nAnd yes, we will build a great wall. Build a great wall. \nWho is going to pay for the wall? 100%. \nThey don\u2019t know it yet but they\u2019re paying for it. \nHonestly, they do know it. They do know it. And it\u2019s all right. \nI met two months ago with the president of Mexico \u2013 good guy. We\u2019ll work things out. We\u2019ll have better relationships with Mexico. We\u2019ll have better relationships with China. \nLook at China. We have a trade deficit with China of almost $500 billion a year. Think of it. China. Think of it. \nAnd yet they taunt us with building a massive fortress right smack in the middle of the South China Sea. They\u2019re not supposed to be doing that. \nWe have no relationship with China, and yet, they rip up. \nI\u2019ve had a great relationship with China. The largest bank in the world is a tenant of mine in Manhattan and so many other things. \nWe\u2019re going to have a great relationship with China. \nAnd I\u2019m not angry at China. I\u2019m angry at our leaders for allowing so many different countries to rip us off. That\u2019s who I\u2019m angry with. \nAll right. That will end. \nDoes anybody have doubt that that\u2019s \u2013 and we will have \u2013 honestly, we\u2019re going to have a better relationship with most of these countries. The reason is they don\u2019t respect us. \nThey don\u2019t respect Obama. He\u2019s like a cheerleader. He\u2019s jumping up and down all over the place for Hillary. He shouldn\u2019t be doing that. He shouldn\u2019t be with her. He\u2019s got to be working. \nYou know what? We\u2019ll be better off if he doesn\u2019t work. He\u2019ll only make bad deals we\u2019ll have to unscramble. We\u2019re better off. \nWe received our first ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol officer \u2013 16,500. First time they\u2019ve ever endorsed a candidate. \nIt\u2019s just been reported that as a result of our open borders, violent cartels have spread into all 50 of our states. \nMore than 90% of those arrested are here illegally. Thank you very much. \nThey\u2019re killing innocent Americans, threatening schools, and totally destroying communities. \nA government that will not protect its people is a government that is unworthy to lead. \nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands and thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminals to go free because their home countries wouldn\u2019t take them back. They\u2019d bring them to their countries and very intelligently, these countries would say, \u201cWe don\u2019t want them. They\u2019re murderers, drug kings. They\u2019re gang members.\u201d So they\u2019d bring them in and the country would say, \u201cWe\u2019re not taking them back. Bring them back to your country.\u201d \nAnd she was head of State Department, and she said \u201cBring them back.\u201d \nBelieve me, I promise you this. Never once, never once will we be bringing anybody back. Never once. Never once. \nAnd if they come back into our country, one year in jail. And if they come back a second time into our country, five years in jail. And then 10 years in jail. And they won\u2019t be coming back. They\u2019re not going to be coming back. Very few. Believe me. \nYou know, just in standing and watching and looking at this incredible spirit right up to the tiny corners of the room with thousands and thousands of people outside watching big screens, anybody want to switch places with them? \nI say isn\u2019t it sad that the most dishonest people there are \u2013 the media \u2013 don\u2019t spin the cameras and show this crowd? Isn\u2019t it sad? \nThey never show the crowds. They never show the crowds. \nToday, Obama had a protester and the protester \u2013 if I have one, they\u2019re immediately picked out. The protester, even though the protesters we just found out through WikiLeaks were paid $1,500 to go into our rallies and be violent. Right? \nAnd in Chicago, they badly hurt policemen. They badly hurt other people. Although our people can take care of themselves very nicely. I will say. \nBut whenever there\u2019s a protester, the only time those cameras move, the only time they pick out a protester because that\u2019s a negative thing. Right? \nAnd yet, Obama today spoke in front of a much smaller crowd than this. Right? And there was a protester. And the protester that likes us. And what happened is they wouldn\u2019t put the cameras on. They kept the cameras on Obama. \nAnd I said that\u2019s strange. You saw it today on television. Right? \nHe was talking. The protester\u2019s screaming at him. Really screaming at him. \nBy the way, if I spoke the way Obama spoke to that protester, they would say, \u201cHe became unhinged. He became \u2013 \u201c \nYou have to go back and look and study and see what happened. They never moved the camera and he spent so much time screaming at this protester and frankly it was a disgrace. \nAnd he shouldn\u2019t be there and he shouldn\u2019t be there to start off. \nBut I\u2019d love to see them spin the cameras. I\u2019d love to see them go outside and see \u2013 I mean, this arena\u2019s massive \u2013 but I\u2019d love to see them go outside and see the thousands and thousands of people that are outside. \nLook at the cameras. They don\u2019t move, folks. They don\u2019t move. They don\u2019t move. They\u2019re right here. They don\u2019t move. They don\u2019t want to show it, folks. They don\u2019t want to show it. \nOh boy, I didn\u2019t expect that. So we\u2019ll dedicate this evening to Riley. Okay? \nThat takes courage. \nHard to go back to the economy after that. Right? \nThank you very much. That was so beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. \nWe will unleash American energy, including shale, oil, natural gas, and clean coal. \nWe will put our miners back to work. We will put our steel workers back to work. We know what\u2019s happened to your state with respect to miners and steel workers. And Hillary wants to do the opposite. We\u2019re going to put them back to work. We\u2019re going to put them back to work. They\u2019re going to be happier than ever before. \nAnd my infrastructure plan will provide help for projects like \u2013 did you ever hear a place called the Pennsylvania Turnpike? Need some help. Need some work. We spent all these trillions all over the place, we can\u2019t fix our potholes in the Pennsylvania Turnpike or anywhere else. \nOur country\u2019s going to hell. Unbelievable. You look at our infrastructure of this country. \nWe will also rebuild our inner-cities. They are so bad. The African-American community, the Hispanic community, people living in the inner-cities have been treated so unfairly. \nThey\u2019ve been run for sometimes more than 100 unbroken by Democrats and people with the wrong ideas. \nThey\u2019re unsafe. You\u2019d get shot walking to the store for a loaf of bread. They\u2019re unsafe. \nThey have the worst education. \nThey have no jobs. No jobs. You look at unemployment of African-American youths. You look at it \u2013 it\u2019s 58%. 58%. \nAnd I say give me a chance. I will fix it. I actually go, what the hell do you have to lose? Believe me. I will fix it. We will all fix it together. It will be a great thing. We have to fix it. We have to fix it. \nWe\u2019re going to fix it. We\u2019re going to fix the inner-cities. \nWe will become a rich nation once again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. \nHillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and that\u2019s over and above the thousands and thousands and thousands that are right now pouring into our country under Obama. \nHer plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism, and radicalization into your schools and throughout your communities. You know what\u2019s happening. \nWhen I\u2019m president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. \nNow, what\u2019s going to happen. Right? They\u2019re not leaving. They won\u2019t leave. \nAnd if they do, we\u2019ll make a lot of money. They\u2019re going to pay a lot of tax. \nBut they won\u2019t leave. They won\u2019t leave. \nA Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA, and if we don\u2019t get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much, much, much better deal for our workers. \nWe will also immediately stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, another disaster in the making. \nAs part of our plan to bring back jobs, we are going to lower taxes on American business from 35% to 15%. \nWe will massively cut taxes for the middle class, most importantly. \nAnd by the way, Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes very substantially. You saw that during the debate. \nBy the way, who won the debates? Who won the debates? \nYou know, she kept saying she is working on debate prep for weeks. She\u2019s always working on debate preps. \nYou know, if you\u2019re doing this stuff for 35 years, why does she need so much debate prep? \nLike a week and a half before the debate, she was at her home. Why wasn\u2019t she leaving? She\u2019s working on debate prep. \nI felt guilty. I mean, how much did you have to learn? Right? \nThat was just an excuse to rest and go to sleep. Okay? Believe me. \nBy the way, two friends of mine and I have to tell you they are incredible \u2013 I don\u2019t even know where they are. This is a hard one to find. \nI\u2019ll tell you what. You know, a great, great couple Barbara and Hugh Rone [sp]. Do you know about their son, Riley, Riley Rone? Where are they? Are they around here some place? Where are they? \nCome up here if you can. Do you mind? Do you mind? \nTell the Secret Service \u2013 believe me, they\u2019re okay to come up. Right? That would be the surprise of all time. \nThese are incredible people. Their son recently passed away in a horrible accident. He was the biggest supporter I had. Young guy, beautiful guy, the most popular person there was. And he was just very special. \n...Riley. Riley was their son. As much as some of you like Trump, I like you more than you like me, if you want to know the truth. \nThis boy was our biggest fan. He loved our country. Believe me. He loved our country. \nSay a few words about our boy. Okay? \nWell, she said it was about the wedding and about yoga. Remember? \n33,000. \nBut I have a feeling the 650,000 will do very nicely. \nIf she were to win, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. This will go on for years, folks. \nIf she ever got into the Oval Office, Hillary and her special interests will rob our country blind. \nMy contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption. \nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we are all about to say. When we win on Nov. 8th, we are going to drain the swamp. \nI keep telling people, I hated that expression. It\u2019s so hokey. And then one group heard it and they went crazy. Another group heard it. Then we had a big, big rally in Florida, they went crazy about it. And now I love it. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s very accurate. \nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. \nThe great state of Pennsylvania has lost almost 40% of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by crooked Hillary Clinton. \nOne of the most amazing statistics that I\u2019ve ever heard \u2013 something I thought was a typographic error \u2013 America has lost, not 700, not 7,000, which I assumed that might be, has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill Clinton and Hillary backed deal. \nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. \nTyco laid [off]...[inaudible] workers in Harrisburg and Carlisle and moved their jobs to China, India, and Mexico. \nTE Connectivity laid off 102 workers in Middletown and moved their jobs to China, Vietnam, and Singapore. \nDura Bond Pipe laid off 145 workers and moved their jobs overseas. \nA Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving Pennsylvania. \nThe theft of American prosperity will end. It\u2019s ending. \nIf a company wants to fire their workers, leave Pennsylvania, move to another country like Mexico, which is taking so many of our companies, and then ship their products back into the United States where we will soon have, by the way, a very strong and powerful border, we will make them pay a 35% tax on those products coming in. \nI hear we set a new record for this building. \nAnd by the way, I didn\u2019t have to bring JLo or Jay Z. The only way she gets anybody. I\u2019m here all by myself. \nI am here all by myself. \nJust me, no guitar, no piano, no nothing. \nBut you know what we do have? And it\u2019s all of us and it\u2019s all the same. We all have great ideas and great vision for our country. That\u2019s what we have. \n...So I know we have two of our great congressmen here \u2013 Tom Marino, Lou Barletta. They\u2019re here. Where are they? No, we love them. Folks, they\u2019re great. \nReal change also means restoring honesty to our government. As you know, the FBI has re \u2013 and you know this. Has anybody heard? Has anybody heard? Just a little rumor. Just a little rumor. \nI think a couple of you \u2013 as you know, the FBI has re-opened its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton. \nThey\u2019re also conducting a second criminal investigation into Hillary\u2019s pay-for-play corruption at the State Department. \nLast night, it was just confirmed that the 650,000 \u2013 can you believe that number? \u2013 emails they discovered include brand new email not previous seen by authorities. Likely, there will be classified information loaded. \nHowever, the reports also show that the political leadership at the Department of Justice is trying very hard, actually as hard as they can, to protect Hillary Clinton from the FBI. From the FBI. \nAnd I salute the FBI for taking this step. \nRemember, John Podesta, her top person, said Hillary Clinton has bad instincts. WikiLeaks. Bernie Sanders says she has bad judgment. \nSo she\u2019s got bad instincts and she\u2019s got bad judgment. Why are we putting her to run for president, right? \nI mean, why is she running? Bad instincts. \nNow, you know, Sanders was running against her so he says bad judgment. \nHere\u2019s a guy who works with her all the time and he puts in email that Hillary has bad instincts. \nThat\u2019s not what we want for president, folks. \nAnd then you have President Obama, instead of getting jobs, instating of taking care of our military, instead of beating ISIS, he\u2019s out campaigning all the time. He ought to go back to the Oval Office and go to work. \nShe created an illegal email server to shield her criminal activity and then she illegally destroyed 33,000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena. The key word is after. \nSo gets the subpoena \u2013 congressional subpoena \u2013 you don\u2019t get any better than that. And she said, you better get rid of these. \n...This is amazing. This is amazing. Unbelievable. \nThank you very much. \nThank you very much, everybody. This is amazing. And you know? We have 7,000 people outside trying to get in. Can you believe it? \nIn four days, we are going to win the great state of Pennsylvania and we are going to win back the White House. We are going to win it back. Unbelievable. Look at this. \nMaybe because I went to school in Pennsylvania. Maybe that\u2019s the reason. Maybe. \nMy kids went to school in Pennsylvania, smart place, Pennsylvania. \nReal change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. \nIt\u2019s just been announced that the residents of Pennsylvania are going to experience a massive double-digit premium hike. No good. \nIn the great state of Arizona, where I just left, premiums are going up more than 116%. \nAll 67 counties in Pennsylvania are losing Obamacare insurers next year. Lots of luck negotiating, folks. \nBut it won\u2019t matter because it will be terminated. You won\u2019t have to bother. We\u2019ll have great health care \u2013 much less expense, much lower price. You\u2019ll be paying a fraction of what you\u2019re paying and you\u2019re going to get really good stuff. I can tell you. \nPremiums are surging on Obamacare. Companies are leaving. Insurers are fleeing. Doctors are quitting. And deductibles are through the roof. You have deductibles \u2013 $13,000, $14,000, $15,000. Nobody\u2019s ever seen anything so ridiculous. \nAnd yet, Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. \nAnd she also wants to, by the way, raise your taxes very substantially. \nI\u2019m asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Pennsylvania and our country. \nWe\u2019re going to do it, folks. We\u2019re going to do it. Boy, are we going to win. We are going to win Pennsylvania big. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks in Ames, Iowa", "text": "Part 6 of 6. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a campaign rally in Ames, Iowa on Jan. 19, 2016. Former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin endorsed Trump following his remarks. \nSo very, very big on the Second Amendment. But what happened is all of a sudden after Paris and to an extent, to a pretty big extent in California, what happened is these polls started coming in where everybody liked Trump even more. I went up 11 points. I don\u2019t want to do it for that reason. \nBut it went up because people want strength just like having the family of John Wayne, who was great. I love John Wayne. From Iowa. But out of nowhere I got the most beautiful letter from his daughter, who you just met, who\u2019s an incredible woman, and she said, \u201cWe\u2019d like to endorse you.\u201d \nJohn Wayne was a strong guy. We need strength. We need strength in this country because we\u2019re withering away with political correctness nonsense. Okay? Nonsense. \nI mean, if you think of it, you can\u2019t say \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d anymore. We\u2019re going to say \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d again. You go into these department stores. They don\u2019t have any Christmas displays. They don\u2019t have the sign \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d. Even people that aren\u2019t Christian are saying \u201cMerry Christmas. We love Christmas. Let us say \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019, Happy Holidays.\u201d But people like to see it. And stores don\u2019t put it up anymore. We\u2019re withering away. We\u2019re going in the wrong direction. \nSo I said we\u2019re going to do this and I had no idea it was going to work this way. I figured I\u2019d be in the pack and maybe like a race horse. You know, just at the end you can sort of inch it out. I had no idea to have 21 point leads nationally. We\u2019re up by so much. And you know, I want to keep it that way. I want to keep it that way. \nWhen you think \u2013 and just one thing before I introduce our incredible person, our incredible guest. But one thing \u2013 I\u2019ve spent to this point almost nothing and I\u2019m in first place by a lot. I tell this story. I\u2019m not bragging about spending. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m telling the story. I have spent \u2013 they\u2019ll tell you \u2013 almost nothing and I\u2019m in first place by some polls have me 21 points. That\u2019s a lot. Okay? You know some people have 2%. I have a lead of 20%. But I\u2019m in first place by a lot. \nJeb has spent now $77 million. Think of it. \nAnd you know the reason I bring him up \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t even bring him up \u2013 but he spends a fortune on ads against me. You people have all seen it before \nI got along with everybody. I contributed to everybody. I was a world class businessman. Now I\u2019m a politician, which I\u2019d hate to tell you. But you go with everybody. You want to love everybody. You want them all to love you unless you\u2019re stupid. But you want everybody to love you. \nEverybody knows this story. But so much money has been spent on me. But he spent $79 million. I spend nothing. I\u2019m in first by a lot. He\u2019s down towards the bottom of the pack. \nAnd I said to myself, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. Wouldn\u2019t that be great if this were the country doing this?\u201d \nAs an example, education. We\u2019re number 28 in the world. We have third world countries that are ahead of us. Education is very important to me. \nWorld, I mean, countries that you wouldn\u2019t believe are ahead of us. You wouldn\u2019t believe if you heard the names of some of these countries. So we\u2019re 28. But we\u2019re number one in spending per pupil by far. \nWouldn\u2019t it be nice if you had like this election process where we spent the least but we had the best education? You know? \nSo Sweden and Norway and China and others are the best. We\u2019re nowhere near them and yet we spend far more per pupil. So we\u2019re going to change that and I told you we\u2019re going to get it localized but we\u2019re going to change that. Watch, you just watch... \nI will tell you this: You can\u2019t educate your children through bureaucrats in Washington. And that\u2019s what happens with Common Core. \nWhen the parents take over and I really mean this because I\u2019ve seen it. When the parents surround those schools and they love those kids and they love those pupils and even when their kids graduate, they are committed to those schools, they\u2019re committed to education. You can do so much better in Iowa than they can possibly do telling you what to do in Washington. \nAnd not all of them but most of them are just interested in \u201cWhere\u2019s my check? How much do I get? Let\u2019s make the process complicated.\u201d \nAnd some of the things that your kids are made to study are an outrage. Okay? So we\u2019re going to bring that back locally and it\u2019s going to be great. \nSo what happened essentially is I started looking and all of a sudden things changed. And people are now looking. They know I\u2019ll do great with China. I\u2019m going to do great with Japan. I\u2019m going to do great with Mexico, who\u2019s killing us in trade and killing us also at the border. \nWe will build a wall and you know who\u2019s going to pay for the wall \u2013 Mexico. They\u2019re going to pay for it because they make a fortune and all of those things. \nBut now, we\u2019re really focused on security and I\u2019m honored because I will tell you that all of polls and the CNN polls where said in particular that Trump is just not by a little bit but by many, many percentage points winning on ISIS, winning on the military, winning with the vets. We\u2019re going to take care of our vets big league, by the way. Big league. Big league. And we\u2019re going to really take care of our military. It\u2019s going to be big and strong and powerful and nobody\u2019s going to mess with us and it\u2019s the cheapest thing we can do, I\u2019ll tell you that right now. \nSo it\u2019s been a real focus. \nI just want to now say just a couple of words about a very special person. This is a person who I\u2019ve known for a long time, who I\u2019ve respected for so long. An incredible husband. An incredible family. And somebody that when I heard that she was going to endorse me, I was so honored. You have no idea how honored. \nAnd I would like to bring up if I might Gov. Sarah Palin. Special, special person. Thank you. \nPart 5 of 6. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a campaign rally in Ames, Iowa on Jan. 19, 2016. Former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin endorsed Trump following his remarks. \nBut what do they also get out of that deal? First of all, they\u2019re going to get nuclear. They don\u2019t have to develop nuclear missiles. They can buy them. For the kind of money we gave them, they\u2019re going to buy them. Why are they going to develop?  \nRemember the deal? 24 days. They have 24 days for inspection period. They also have self-inspection. Right? But we paid $150 billion. And I always say, \u201cWow. What a great \u2013 the Persians are great negotiators.\u201d I say what a great deal that is. \n...Two weeks ago I started. I said, \u201cWait a minute. That\u2019s not a good deal compared to the other deal.\u201d They took over Iraq. We gave them Iraq. We knocked the hell out of Iraq. We decimated their armed forces. And you know, for years, they would fight. For many, many years, for decades they\u2019d fight, fight, fight. Nobody would win. Fight. They\u2019d rest. Then they\u2019d go back to fight. \nAnd now, we gave them the second largest oil reserves in the world, which is Iraq. We gave it to them. Now, they\u2019re going into Yemen. And if you look at Yemen, take a look. They\u2019re going to get Syria. They\u2019re going to get Yemen. \nUnless, you know, trust me a lot of good things are going to happen if I get in. But let\u2019s just sort of leave it the way it is. \nThey get Syria. They get Yemen. Now, they didn\u2019t want Yemen. But did you ever see the border between Yemen and Saudi Arabia? They want Saudi Arabia. \nSo, what are they going to have? They\u2019re going to have Iraq. They\u2019re going to have Iran. They\u2019re going to have Iraq.  They\u2019re going to have Yemen. They\u2019re going to have Syria. They\u2019re going to have everything. They\u2019re going to be a monster. We\u2019ve created this. We have stupid leadership. Really stupid leadership. \nSo when I started, I said we have to do something about it. It\u2019s not something I wanted to do. It\u2019s something we have to do. \nBecause I\u2019m representing you. I\u2019m not taking any money. I\u2019m not, you know, like some of these guys where they\u2019re getting millions and millions of dollars from people I know and they\u2019re nice people and some are very bad people but they have no interest in the country. They have interests in their company or they have interests in countries they\u2019re representing. \nAnd these people and these politicians are going to do exactly as they\u2019re told by their lobbyists, their special interests, and their donors. \nMe, I\u2019m going to do the right thing. \nAnd I always tell the story. When Ford moves to Mexico, I\u2019m going to talk them out of it. When Nabisco moves its plant from Chicago to Mexico, I\u2019m going to talk them out of it. Believe me. It\u2019s going to be easy. It\u2019s going to be easy. \nSo, I started and I talked about the border. Very strong on immigration and illegal immigration. Took a lot of heat. But you wouldn\u2019t even be talking about that subject if I didn\u2019t bring it up. \nAnd I talked about again I talked about ISIS and I talked about. But what really happened is after Paris we had 130 people killed. \nAnd by the way, I told you Common Core is dead and Second Amendment is right this way. We\u2019re going to protect the Second Amendment. We\u2019re going to protect the guns. We\u2019re going to protect your guns. \nYou know, if in Paris and if in Los Angeles, we had the two maniacs that were married. She came on a fiancee permit...You know, wonderful fiancee. She was totally radicalized. Maybe radicalized him. Maybe he was already that way. But we\u2019ve got to start thinking. We have to start using our head. Bad stuff is happening. We have to find out what\u2019s going on. \nWe have a president who won\u2019t even talk about the term. If you think, he won\u2019t even mention anything to do with what we all know is going on. And you can\u2019t solve the problem if you don\u2019t talk about it. You have to talk about it. \nSo, very, very strongly we started talking about that. And then after Paris \u2013 and by the way, if we had a couple of you and you and you and you, if we had three or four people in that room in Paris as an example where they have the toughest gun laws like in the world. You can\u2019t have a gun unless you\u2019re bad guy, you bought a gun. And they walked in just said \u201cBoom! Boom! Boom! You, move over. Boom!\u201d Killed 130, more to follow because there are people that are so badly wounded. \nBut if we had a couple of \u2013 few of the people that I pointed out \u2013 I could plenty in this audience, believe me. But if they had guns on their waist, if they had guns around their ankle where the bullets went the opposite direction, it would have been a whole different story, folks. It\u2019d be a whole different story. \nPart 4 of 6. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a campaign rally in Ames, Iowa on Jan. 19, 2016. Former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin endorsed Trump following his remarks. \nNow, yours is a little more complicated because the caucus system is a little bit different. It\u2019s a very interesting system. But it is different. \nHere\u2019s what I have to say about Iowa. It\u2019s very important. \nSo you know there\u2019s a movement to move Iowa to the back of the pack. Okay? You know that. You\u2019ll still see me but you won\u2019t see other people. Believe me. I\u2019m loyal. To a fault I\u2019m loyal. \nBut you\u2019re going to see. I give you my word. I win; they\u2019re not touching Iowa. This is an amazing tradition. No, seriously. This is an amazing tradition. They\u2019re not moving Iowa back. \nAnd they\u2019re not moving New Hampshire either because they\u2019re talking about Iowa, New Hampshire. They\u2019re not touching New Hampshire. \nSo, we\u2019re going to just keep it the way it is. It really is. It\u2019s an amazing. First of all, you\u2019re amazing people. But all over the country it\u2019s a movement all over the country. The people are incredible. They want to make America great again. They\u2019re going to do something that\u2019s special. \nAnd you know we used to talk silent majority? I say it\u2019s the noisy majority because it\u2019s actually a noisy majority. It\u2019s not a silent majority. \nBut people are fed up. \nSo I started on June 16th and we did well. Practically from the beginning we went up. And if you remember, we started at nothing. You know, we started at nothing because nobody believed I was going to [run]. Even when they \u2013 my wife said, \u201cYou know if you run, you\u2019re going to win.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She said, \u201cPeople don\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to run.\u201d At the polls. I was getting these little polls. I felt like some of these guys now that are senators and governors; they get these little polls. \n...Jeb again, right? Boy, he\u2019s taking a lot of abuse. You know? I told him \u201cYou know what? You should use the name Bush. What\u2019s wrong? Use the name Bush. I mean, maybe it\u2019s not working but it\u2019s better than Jeb right?\u201d You know, I really do. Get rid of the exclamation point and just put Jeb Bush. It\u2019s your name. Don\u2019t be ashamed of your name. \nSo anyways, I wish him the best. \nBut, you know, I started and I started at like 2% or 3% and then it went to 6% and then it went to 9%. And each time the pundits \u2013 these real geniuses back here \u2013 some of them are sitting back here \u2013 these real geniuses like George Will with the little glasses \u2013 take away the glasses. He looks like a dumb guy, I\u2019m telling you. \nBut each time these geniuses would say, \u201cWell, he\u2019s reached his plateau. He\u2019s plateaued\u201d at 6%, right? Then it goes to 11%. \u201cWell, you know, this is surprising but he\u2019s reached his plateau.\u201d And then it goes to 18%. And then it went to 22%, 24%, 28%, then it went to 32%. Then it went actually 42% in the Gravis poll and in Reuters we got to 42% and even a little above that. And then all of a sudden you didn\u2019t hear so much about the plateau. \nI want to plateau at 42%. You know, 42% with like 14 people that\u2019s pretty good. \nBut they kept saying, \u201cHe\u2019s plateaued. That\u2019s all he\u2019ll get. He\u2019s got these followers.\u201d \nWe have the smartest followers there are. Number one, we have the smartest. And the hardest working followers. We have people that love the country more than anybody and they want to take back what\u2019s happened because our country is going to hell. \nWe can be nice about it. We can say it nice and soft. Our country is going to hell. \nWhen you look at this crazy Iran deal where we\u2019re paying $150 billion and they give us the five back but they don\u2019t know where the fifth is and you understand what that means. That\u2019s not a good sign. But they give us five people but they get seven and they get 14 off the Interpol. These are bad dudes. They get 14 plus seven so they\u2019re getting 21 people. And they have the right to do whatever they want from an enterprise standpoint. Right to do oil. Right to do whatever they want. \nPart 3 of 6. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a campaign rally in Ames, Iowa on Jan. 19, 2016. Former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin endorsed Trump following his remarks. \n...So South Carolina just came out and that\u2019s 32% for Trump, 18% for second, 11% for third. Great. \nFlorida leading by a lot \u2013 31%, 19%, 13%, and then all down in the dumps. \nGeorgia just came out. I have 33%. \nYeah, don\u2019t forget that\u2019s 33%. Hard to believe. That\u2019s with 14 people, 15 people. I don\u2019t know when they took it but it was recent. 33%. \nConnecticut \u2013 now, Tom Brady loves me and that\u2019s sort of like, you know, and I love Tom Brady by the way. 35% to 18% to 9% to 2%. You know, to nothing. \nMaryland just came out. Maryland \u2013 great place \u2013 32% to 15% to 11% to 9% and then you know they sort of phase out. \nYou ever hear of a place called Iowa? Oh, I love this. We\u2019re doing actually great. First of all, I have to tell you. You know, they never report it. Even CNN doesn\u2019t report it. CNN does a poll, probably spent millions, they never report their poll. \nThe CNN poll was 33% for Trump, 20% for Chris. Nobody talks about it. Nobody talks about it. They don\u2019t talk about it. They talk about \u2013 CNN is reporting other people\u2019s polls. So, I call up. I say, \u201cWait a minute. You\u2019re CNN. You spent a fortune on polls and you don\u2019t report your own polls because I\u2019m winning by a lot.\u201d And they have no excuse but they keep reporting other polls. But we\u2019re doing well. I think we\u2019re doing a lot better than anyone knows. \nGravis just came out \u2013 34% for Trump, 28% for Cruz. PPP 28% for Trump, 26% for Cruz. In other words, it\u2019s a little close here. Quinnipiac poll \u2013 very respected 31% for Trump, 29% for Cruz. And then again CNN 33% to 20%. \nSo we\u2019re \u2013 I think we\u2019re doing good. I think we\u2019re actually doing better than the polls. \nNow, I could do this. I could say, \u201cWell, I just want to do well in Iowa.\u201d I want to win Iowa, folks. Because look, I love the people. The evangelicals have been phenomenal. I\u2019m doing great with the evangelicals but nationwide I\u2019m winning with evangelical \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you know that \u2013 by a lot nationwide. \nWith Iowa, I\u2019m doing really well with the evangelicals. We\u2019re doing really well with the Tea Party. We\u2019re doing well \u2013 I mean, you hear the numbers. I mean, these are the numbers. \nBut I actually think we\u2019re doing even better than the polls. And you know, there\u2019s the thing that a lot of people said, you know, they call up, \u201cAre you going to vote for Trump? He\u2019s got very, very tough immigration policies. He wants to destroy Obamacare and replace it with something a lot better.\u201d I\u2019m going to do that. Okay? \nBut you know, a lot of people, they\u2019ll pick up the phone and they\u2019ll hear different things and they\u2019ll say, \u201cUh, no I\u2019ll vote for \u2013 \u201c and then they\u2019d get in the booth and they say, \u201cTrump is my man.\u201d There are a lot of people saying that we\u2019re going to do a lot better. But we\u2019ll see because Feb. 1st you have to get to caucus, you have to go out. You\u2019ve got to do it. Otherwise, we\u2019ve all wasted our time. \nYou know, one of the groups in Maine and it was like incredible. We were in different places up in New England recently and New Hampshire was amazing. And the people are standing there. It was so cold. There was one little group of \u2013 despite global warming \u2013 you know, you hear about \u201cIt was so cold.\u201d It was windchill below zero. And people were standing outside for hours trying to get in. \nAnd then you hear the announcers. \u201cWell, will they show up to vote?\u201d And I don\u2019t know much but I say like if people are going to stand out for four hours in the cold or the heat because believe me they stood out in the heat during the summer and during the fall like you wouldn\u2019t believe in Tennessee, in Texas where we had 21,000 people, no matter where we go we have these big crowds but they\u2019ll stand for hours and hours to get in. Why aren\u2019t they going to go and vote? Or in your case caucus? Why aren\u2019t they going to go and vote? It\u2019s sort of an amazing thing. So we think they\u2019re going to really be \u2013 why would somebody wait for hours for four hours and not going to take two minutes to vote? \nPart 2 of 6. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a campaign rally in Ames, Iowa on Jan. 19, 2016. Former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin endorsed Trump following his remarks. \nAnd I filed the financials and they saw an unbelievable \u2013 you didn\u2019t hear a thing about it. Oh boy, were they looking. I mean, were they looking. And almost 100 pages. The biggest report ever filed with the FEC in terms of that. And it showed a company that\u2019s a phenomenal company with some of the great assets, very little debt, tremendous cash flow. You know, the way it\u2019s supposed to be. And it\u2019s great. \nAnd the reason I tell you that is because that is the kind of thinking we need now in the United States. We need that kind of thinking. We need that \u2013 whatever it is. We need a mentality that\u2019s going to \u2013 you know, we\u2019re at $19 trillion in debt. It\u2019s going to be up to $21 trillion. You saw that horrible budget. Horrible, horrible budget that was approved two weeks ago and that\u2019s going to lift it. \nAnd so we went along and a lot of things have happened and then the polls came out which I love and new ones came out today and I\u2019ll tell you right now. You know, now that we\u2019re at it. And they came out some brand new ones \u2013 some beauties. And one\u2019s coming out \u2013 I guess a big one\u2019s coming out. I don\u2019t know exactly what it is but it\u2019s got to be pretty good because I see the response. \nI mean, even this with all the people still trying to come into this building. Somebody said it\u2019s a barn. This is a very nice barn actually. But with all of the people still trying to come in, you see what it is. \nAnd we do have something special in a couple of minutes. To me, it\u2019s really special because it\u2019s a person that I think is a spectacular person. So it\u2019s very special to me. \nBut then the polls came out and some of them \u2013 as an example \u2013 national polls 38% for Trump, 20% for second. I wouldn\u2019t even names. Right? I won\u2019t even mention names. I\u2019m going to be non-confrontational today for a change. \n21% for the second. 11%. And then they\u2019re all down. Some of them are actually at 0% and 1%. I don\u2019t know. \nJeb \u2013 well, you know, Jeb\u2019s got one problem. He loves Common Core, meaning he wants your kids educated from Washington, which is immediately no good. \nAnd his second problem is he\u2019s very weak on illegal immigration. Remember, he said they come as an act of love. I said, \u201cWhat? They come as an act of love?\u201d \nSo I think those are two very bad points frankly. \nPart 1 of 6. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a campaign rally in Ames, Iowa on Jan. 19, 2016. Former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin endorsed Trump following his remarks. \nWow, what a crowd. Thank you very much everybody. Such an honor. With the snow coming down and it\u2019s a little cold outside and you have hundreds of people still outside trying to get in. But you know, we won\u2019t wait. We\u2019ll go ahead. Right? \nWe\u2019ll go ahead. \nFirst of all, congratulations to the Iowa State basketball team. You had a \u2013 what was that all about? I turned on the game. I said, \u201cWow, this shouldn\u2019t be that good of a game.\u201d And at the end of the game, I said, \u201cWho won?\u201d Yes? That was great and it\u2019s a great achievement. \nI also want to pay my respects to Ben Carson. They had a really bad accident. Some of his staffers were hurt really bad. So I just want to pay my respects to Ben. He\u2019s a good guy \u2013 a really good guy \u2013 and his staffers and hopefully they get better. Say a prayer for them. Okay? \nWe\u2019ve had an amazing time today. We\u2019ve been all over Iowa and we\u2019re going to be here tomorrow. We\u2019re going to be here so much you\u2019re going to get so sick of me. You\u2019re going to say, \u201cPlease, tell him to get out of here. Tell him to leave. Tell him to go.\u201d \nBut we\u2019ve had an incredible time. \nAnd you know it started really \u2013 we\u2019ve had really a pretty good week. The debate last week \u2013 everybody watched the debate. And who knew about these debates? I didn\u2019t know anything about the debates. And it\u2019s been fun and it\u2019s been interesting. And I\u2019ve been treated semi-fairly by the moderators. Not 100%. Some have been very fair actually, and some have been not so fair. \nAnd you know, a lot of the press hasn\u2019t been very fair. \nBoy, look at the press back there. They must think there\u2019s a big event going happen today. Wow, that\u2019s a lot of them \u2013 it\u2019s like the Academy Awards. \nBut we\u2019ve had an amazing \u2013 it\u2019s been an amazing experience and it started really on June 16th when we came down the escalator. We came down that escalator and it was \u2013 I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d to my wife, who\u2019s been so supportive and so wonderful. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019re going to make America great again. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d \nAnd you know, it\u2019s hard to do this because when you think of it I\u2019ve never done it before. I\u2019ve never been a politician. Thank goodness but I\u2019ve never been a politician. I\u2019ve always done jobs and put a lot of people to work. Tens of thousands of people over the years. \nAnd you know, I have thousands of Hispanics that love me. The Nevada poll just came out where I\u2019m leading with Hispanics, which I knew, I knew. \nAnd we came out at that particular opening when I opened and said I\u2019m going to run for president I gave up a lot. You know, gave up a lot of different things including telling our friends at NBC no more Apprentice. That\u2019s hard to do. You have a top show and you say, \u201cI\u2019m not doing it anymore. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d They wanted to do it so badly. \nAnd Steve Burke, who\u2019s a fantastic executive, came up to my office and said \u201cCome on, Donald. Come on. Do it. You\u2019re not going to run. Do it. Do it.\u201d I said, \u201cSteve, I\u2019m going to run.\u201d I was pretty sure. You know, that was about two months before. I was pretty sure. It really is a tough thing to do. \nYou know, all my life I\u2019ve heard \u201cIf you\u2019re a very successful person, you\u2019ll never run for president. You\u2019ll never really run for politics. But you\u2019ll never ever run for president.\u201d \nAnd I built a great company and it\u2019s a tremendous number. You saw the filings. The press was going to look so closely. It was like D-Day when we put those papers in. \nYou know, first thing I did I announced. They said, \u201cOh, he\u2019s actually going to do it\u201d because most of them said \u201cHe\u2019ll never do it.\u201d \nThen when I signed...that\u2019s when you sign your life away. And I signed that. They said, \u201cWhoa! He signed that. Well, he\u2019ll never file his financials because maybe he\u2019s not as rich as everybody thinks.\u201d "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks near the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas \u2013 July 23, 2015", "text": "That\u2019s right. We\u2019re going to make a tour. We\u2019ll go the border. And we\u2019ll see you later. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see you later. \nQuestion:\u00a0 \nHow do you feel about the union \u2013 the border union \u2013 backing out? \nWell, they\u2019re petrified and they\u2019re afraid of saying what\u2019s happening. You know, they\u2019re the ones that invited me. They wanted to give me an award. \nAnd the border patrol \u2013 they\u2019re petrified of saying what\u2019s happening because they have a real problem here. And I\u2019m talking about on the whole border. \nAnd they invited me and all of a sudden they were told \u2013 silencio \u2013 they want silence. \nSo it\u2019s a problem that we will get straighten out. \nIf I win, believe me, we\u2019ll get things straighten out. \nQuestion: \nWell, they say it\u2019s a great danger but I have to do it. I love the country. There\u2019s nothing more important than what I\u2019m doing. \nAnd I\u2019m the one that brought up the problem of illegal immigration. \nAnd it\u2019s a big problem. It\u2019s a huge problem. \nYou folks know it better than anybody. \nAnd you look at the crowds outside. We have big crowds that are all screaming in favor of Trump. Everybody wants me because they want the problem fixed. \nQuestion:\u00a0 \nWe have to have legal immigration. \nQuestion: \nYeah, we want to get the legal immigration in. We want legal immigration. \nQuestion:\u00a0 \nWell, I think Rick Perry did a terrible job as the governor of Texas where the border security was terrible. \nNow, your new governor of Texas I think is doing a great job \u2013 Abbott. Gov. Abbott\u2019s doing a great job. \nBut Rick Perry, honestly, I don\u2019t think he even understands... \nOh, he\u2019s following in my lead, absolutely. I mean, we\u2019re the ones that brought up \u2013 you know, I took a lot of heat the first week. And then the second week, everybody realized that I was right. \n...You know, one other thing. I employ thousands and thousands of Hispanics. I love the people. The Latinos. I love the people. They\u2019re great. They\u2019re workers. They\u2019re fantastic people. \nBut they want \u2013 and they want \u2013 these people that work for me \u2013 they want legal immigration. They want it to be legal. They don\u2019t want the illegal immigration with all the tremendous amount of crime that already even today I\u2019m hearing about. \nAnd people are saying \u201cOh, it\u2019s so dangerous. What you\u2019re doing, Mr. Trump, it\u2019s so dangerous. What you\u2019re doing.\u201d \nI have to do it. I have to do it.

It\u2019s such an honor. \nI was called by Sen. [Ted] Cruz a few days ago and he said, \u201cDo you think we can get a really good crowd out here to protest this incompetent deal?\u201d And I said, \u201cBoy, can we get a crowd.\u201d And that was three days ago and look what shows up and I want to thank you. I want to thank you. \nSo, I\u2019ve been doing deals for a long time. I\u2019ve been making lots of wonderful deals, great deals. That\u2019s what I do. \nNever, ever, ever in my life have I seen any transaction so incompetently negotiated as our deal with Iran. And I mean, never. \nNow, Ted and everybody else have gone through all of the details and we can talk about the 24 days, which is ridiculous. \nWe can talk about the $150 billion, which by the way they get even if the deal isn\u2019t approved. They get it just for going to the table. \nWe can talk about the fact that we have four wonderful people over there and frankly they\u2019re never going to come back with this group. \nAnd I\u2019ll say this: If I win the presidency, I guarantee you that those four prisoners are back in our country before I even take office. I guarantee that. \nThey will be back before I ever take office because they know that\u2019s what has to happen. Okay? They know it. And if they don\u2019t know it, I\u2019m telling them right now. \nSo, I have a story that just came out an hour ago and as President Obama calls him very routinely, he calls him the Supreme Leader. Our President is calling the person who is really the boss in Iran Supreme Leader and I look at people shaking their head; they can\u2019t believe it. But it just came out a little while ago, he said \u201cIsrael will not exist in 25 years.\u201d \nThink of that. He just said this. \nHe also said very strongly, very, very strongly that \u201cThis is the end of our dealings with the United States. We want nothing more to do with them. We\u2019re not going to do anything right here. We made this deal. It\u2019s a phenomenal deal. We\u2019re not going to deal with the United States anymore.\u201d And that\u2019s what he just said and this was a very short period of time ago. \nSo, they rip us off. They take our money. They make us look like fools. And now they\u2019re back to being who they really are. They don\u2019t want Israel to survive. They will not let Israel survive with incompetent leadership like we have right now. Israel will not survive. \nAnd then when it\u2019s all done or they think it\u2019s all done, they come out with these unbelievable nasty statements that Israel won\u2019t be around in 25 years and that we will have no dealings and we will have no further dealings with the United States. \nNow, the people that we were negotiating with and were working on the sanctions, with including and as an example Russia who is selling tremendous missiles to Iran. You know that. Ballistic missiles being sold. \nAll of these countries \u2013 all of these countries \u2013 are going to do business with Iran. They\u2019re going to make lots of money and lots of other things with Iran. \nAnd we\u2019re going to do \u2013 and we\u2019re going to get nothing. Nothing. \nWe are led by very, very stupid people. Very, very stupid people. We cannot let it continue. \nWe are a country that owes $19 trillion. We lose everywhere. \nWe lose militarily. We can\u2019t beat ISIS. Give me a break! We can\u2019t beat anybody. \nOur vets are being treated horribly. \nIt will change. We will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with winning. Believe me. \nI agree. You \u2018ll never get bored of winning. We\u2019d never get bored. \nWe are going to turn this country around. We are going to start winning big league on trade, militarily. \nWe\u2019re going to build up our military. We\u2019re going to have such a strong military that nobody \u2013 nobody \u2013 is going to mess with us. We\u2019re not going to have to use it. \nI really, really this tremendous crowd. We are going to make America great again! \nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Now or unless he was just saying that on CNN to be nice but he did say that. \n...And we had a legitimate misunderstanding in terms of his pronunciation of a word. \nBut I would say \u2013 well, I think it was. And he actually said that. Did you say that? \nOkay, so I will say this though you was giving me name after name \u2013 Arab name, Arab name, Arab name \u2013 and there are few people anywhere, anywhere that would have known those names. \nI think he was reading them off a sheet. \nAnd frankly I will have and I told him I will have the finest team that anybody\u2019s put together and we will solve a lot of problems. \nYou know, right now, they know a lot and look at what\u2019s happening.

You cannot let Iran have a nuclear weapon. You can\u2019t have it. When they march down the streets saying \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d, \u201cDeath to the United States\u201d. You can\u2019t let it happen. It will not happen. Believe me, it will not happen here. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]...on Trump\u2019s campaign budget \nWhat I want to do is I want to make the country great. That\u2019s all I want to do. That\u2019s much more important. \nMy businesses have been so successful. My children are my executives who will run that easily. I won\u2019t even think about \u2013 I won\u2019t even care about it. \nMy sole focus will be taking that brain that built a great business with some of the great assets of the world. I have some of the great assets \u2013 Turnberry in Scotland, Doral in Miami \u2013 I have some of the greatest assets in the world. Best locations in Manhattan. Trump Tower \u2013 57th and Fifth. That\u2019s what I do. \nThat whole \u2013 whatever it is, whatever kind of a brain that is will be used to making our country rich again. Trade deals \u2013 great trade deals. Making our country rich. \nAnd then making it great. We can\u2019t make it great unless we make it rich. \nWe have to bring back the money. We\u2019re a debtor nation. We owe $19 trillion. \nSo, my whole focus will be this country and making it great. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]...on spending $1 billion on the election \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nLook, when I said Mexico is sending, I was talking about illegal immigration. The people understood it even though the press didn\u2019t want them to. My numbers went up. \nWhen I talked about John McCain, I was saying how bad he\u2019s treated the veterans because the veterans are treated badly. Then they do a poll. Who do you like better \u2013 to the veterans \u2013 John McCain or Trump? And I swamped him in the poll. The veterans like me better because they know I\u2019ll take care of them. He hasn\u2019t taken \u2013 after 30 years, he hasn\u2019t taken care of them. \nAnd this last thing with Fox. I mean, I love Roger Ailes. But all you have to do is ask Roger Ailes \u201cWho won?\u201d \nSo I don\u2019t think I made any mistakes. I\u2019m sure I will at some point. But so far, you would have to say \u201cHas it worked out badly?\u201d Right? \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nEverything we do is wrong. The military \u2013 we\u2019re not taking care of the military. Not taking care of our vets. We\u2019re not taking care of our country. We\u2019re not taking care of our finances. We\u2019re not taking care of our trade deals. \nWhen was the last time you saw this country have a victory? We don\u2019t have victories. We don\u2019t have victories against China in trade. \nChina just devalued their currency. That\u2019s the sucking sound. You know what that is? That means jobs and money coming out of our country. \nWhat they did with that devaluation \u2013 the biggest devaluation they\u2019ve had in two decades. They\u2019re killing us. \nThey won\u2019t be doing it when I\u2019m watching. And I think our people have no idea what\u2019s happening... \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nSo we\u2019re going to start \u2013 tax policy, which I happen to be very good at. I mean, who knows the system better than me? I\u2019m putting out a tax policy paper over the next two weeks. \nSo we\u2019re putting them out one by one. \nAnd I think that you will see that it\u2019s going to be very important. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd you know, when you put out policy like a 14-point plan, a lot of times in the first hour of negotiation that 14-point plan goes astray but you may end up with a better deal. That\u2019s the way it works. I mean, that\u2019s the way really life works. \nWhen I do a deal, I don\u2019t say, \u201cOh, here\u2019s 14-points plan.\u201d I go out and do it. I don\u2019t sit down and talk about 14 points. \nBut I know the press wants it. I don\u2019t think the people care. I think they trust me. I think they know I\u2019m going to make good deals for them. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nNobody has more experience. You know, it\u2019s sort of interesting. Nobody has more experience dealing with politicians than I. I\u2019ve been dealing with them all my life, whether it\u2019s big New York City zoning deals, which by the way, are probably tougher than most of the things I\u2019ll be dealing with with foreign countries. \nI mean, I built a city on the Westside of Manhattan. You talk about getting zoning. Getting zoned for Trump Tower \u2013 68 stories on 57th and Fifth. Let me tell you, I\u2019ve been dealing with politicians all my life. They\u2019re fine. They\u2019re wonderful. They\u2019re all talk. They\u2019re no action. They\u2019re selling this country down the tubes, and they\u2019re easy to deal with. Believe me. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nYou know, the paper\u2019s not relevant. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWe\u2019re building a wall. It\u2019s going to be a wall that\u2019s not \u2013 nobody\u2019s going through my wall. Trump builds walls. I build walls. \nWe\u2019re building a wall. It\u2019s going to be strong. It\u2019s going to be solid. It\u2019s going to be policed. \nYou know, somebody said they can tunnel under. Well, that\u2019s true. But with x-ray equipment, they can\u2019t. All you have to do is fly a drone over it. They can see that immediately. \nSo, nobody can go under it. Nobody\u2019s going over it. \nAnd you know what? We\u2019re going to have a big door for people to come in legally. We\u2019re going to have a big, beautiful door for people to come in legally. I want people to come into the country, but they have to come in legally. \nSo you\u2019ll be very happy with me. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI\u2019m doing well. I\u2019m leading in every poll. The little ones. The big ones. I\u2019m leading. So importantly to me I\u2019m leading in Iowa. \nBecause when people look at Scott Walker, his state has a $2.2 billion deficit. He thought \u2013 you know, he was telling people \u2013 his growth is terrible in terms of the state, and there\u2019s tremendous dissention all over the state. But they said they were going to have a big surplus of $1 billion. Well, the $1 billion surplus is a $2.2 billion deficit. And nobody was willing to say it but me. And I didn\u2019t want to say it. I would not have said it until he attacked me. Then I said, \u201cThank you very much\u201d then I said it. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWhy, do you think they\u2019re getting along good right now? Putin can\u2019t stand Obama. Nobody \u2013 who likes Obama? I\u2019m talking worldwide. He\u2019s not getting along with anybody. \nAnd I\u2019ve said it. Hillary Clinton was the single worst Secretary of State in the history of this country. The world collapsed around us while she was Secretary of State. \nNow, in my opinion, Kerry might be worse because he\u2019s making a deal with Iran that is so bad and so dangerous and so incompetent and stupid that it will have grave consequences \u2013 grave consequences. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nMexico is sort of becoming the new China in terms of trade. \nSo many companies \u2013 just yesterday I read where Nabisco \u2013 Nabisco is moving to Mexico. I mean, give me a break. \nSo we have to reverse that. We need jobs in our country. We don\u2019t have to worry about other countries. We\u2019re going to take jobs back from China, Japan. We\u2019re going to make our country great again. And that to me is going to be the challenge. \nAnd we\u2019re going to do it and it\u2019s not going to be that difficult.  \nI spoke with Carl Icahn. He\u2019s a friend of mine. He\u2019s a great negotiator. He will help us. \nAll of the best negotiators \u2013 we have the best business people in the world in this country. They\u2019ll all help us. \nAnd believe me, when I get the right people negotiating with the right countries, we will come out on top every single time. \nAnd that\u2019s what we need. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nHe\u2019s got lobbyists and you know he made statements over the last couple of days that are incredible trying to justify the war in Iraq. Can\u2019t be justified. \nAnd then he said \u201cskin in the game\u201d. I don\u2019t know if you saw his recent statement. He said the United States has to prove to Iraq that we have skin in the game. \nWe\u2019ve spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives lost, wounded warriors who I love all over the place, and he said we have to prove that we have skin in the game. \nI think it maybe one of the dumbest statements I\u2019ve ever heard. Skin in the game. We don\u2019t have to prove anything. \nFirst of all, the Iraqi officials are a bunch of crooks, if there\u2019s even an Iraq which I don\u2019t think there is. Iran is taking over Iraq. It was one of the dumbest things ever. \nAnd I think what happened because I understand psychology, I think his brother probably said \u201cHey, you\u2019re killing me.\u201d That was his war and he looks very bad. So Jeb Bush tried to push back. \nBut when he said we have to prove to Iraq that we have skin in the game and we\u2019ve lost all of those lives and all of that money, I think he should apologize to the families of the people. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nThese are not people that are doing it because they like the color of his hair, believe me. These are highly sophisticated killers. And when they give $5 million or $2 million or $1 million to Jeb, they have him just like a puppet. He\u2019ll do whatever they want. He\u2019s their puppet. Believe me. \nAnd with me, I had yesterday a lobbyist called me up. It\u2019s a friend of mine. Good guy. Smart as hell. He\u2019s \u2013 for his client, I don\u2019t blame him. He said, \u201cDonald, I want to put $5 million into your campaign.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t need it. I don\u2019t want it.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no, I want to put $5 million in.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want it because when you come back to me in two years and you want help for a company you\u2019re representing or a country that you\u2019re representing, I\u2019m going to do the right thing for the people of the United States and I don\u2019t want to have to insult you. So honestly, I appreciate it. I don\u2019t want your $5 million.\u201d \nI\u2019m turning down so much money. But if he put it up, I\u2019d feel obligated because I\u2019m a loyal person just like Jeb Bush. \nJeb Bush and all of them. I\u2019m not just talking about Jeb Bush. Hillary too. \nBelieve me. Nobody played the game better than I did. I know the game from the other side and that\u2019s the way it works. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI will take care of people. \nAnd I will be better to women. It\u2019s another thing. I heard with Jeb \u2013 women\u2019s health issues he didn\u2019t want to fund. Then he goes back two, three hours later and he said oh he misspoke. He misspoke? \nI will be so great to women. I cherish women, and the women haven\u2019t been take care of properly. \nWhen I hear somebody like Jeb Bush talking about we\u2019re not going to fund, then he comes back because you know his pollsters said \u201cYou made a mistake. You have to go back and take it back.\u201d \nBut he doesn\u2019t mean it from the heart. \nThank you very much. Thank you. It\u2019s a great honor to be here. Thank you... \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI love children. I love Iowa. Great place. I\u2019ve really developed a relationship with it, and it\u2019s an amazing place. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd actually the venues have gotten larger and larger because we\u2019ve really gotten some tremendous crowds. We\u2019re doing record-breaking crowds. \nAnd I\u2019m so honored when I saw the recent polls with Iowa, leading by a lot. \nBut we have actually \u2013 and we started with the smaller venues and we\u2019ve gotten bigger and bigger. The crowds have gotten to be enormous actually. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]...on Hillary Clinton\u2019s email \nIf you look at Gen. Petraeus, he had just a tiny fraction of what she\u2019s got going and they destroyed his life virtually. \nSo I think she\u2019s got some very big problems. I wish her luck but I think she\u2019s got some big problems. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI hope that\u2019s not what happens to her but certainly the facts aren\u2019t looking for her right now. \nAnd if you look at Gen. Petraeus, what he went through on a much lesser level, is I think it\u2019s going to be very tough for her. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nBut we have to be prepared. Look, the world hates us, probably never like this before. And we have to build up our military. We have to take care of our vets. And we have to have the finest armament. We have to have the finest military and equipment anywhere in the world by a factor of 10. \nWe have to be protected. We have to be so tough and so strong and so smart that nobody will ever mess with us. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks on tax reform", "text": "Question: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nBut I will tell you. I\u2019ve been honest. I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s honest about this thing. \nI watched Romney. I watched all \u2013 \u201cOh, I pay so much tax. I pay so much tax.\u201d I watched all politicians and they say \u201cI pay \u2013 \u201d \nI fight like hell to pay as little as possible. Can I say that? I\u2019m not a politician. \nI fight like hell always because it\u2019s an expense. \nAnd you know, I feel \u2013 I fight. I have the best lawyers and the best accountants and I fight. And I pay. But it\u2019s an expense. \nAnd frankly, I would feel differently if this country was spending the money wisely instead of throwing it out the drain. \nOur country spends our money so stupidly and I will tell you that I could speak for myself I pay a lot of tax but I fight like hell to make it as low as possible. But I would feel a lot differently if our leadership was such that I respected the decisions. \nAll you have to do is look at a list of the things that our government is spending money on right now and you don\u2019t feel so good about our country. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nYou know, right now, we have a false \u2013 5.4%, 5.3%, 5.6% \u2013 every month it\u2019s different. \nIt\u2019s such a phony number. Because when people look and look and look and then they give up looking for a job, they\u2019re taken off the roll. So the number isn\u2019t reflective. \nI\u2019ve seen numbers of 24%. I actually saw a number of 42% unemployment. 42%. \nAnd it could be because when you\u2019re looking for a job and you go around and you look and you look and you find it, you want to work and you want to take care of your family and then you can\u2019t get the job \u2013 you know what I\u2019m talking about because you\u2019re shaking your head \u2013 and you can\u2019t get the job, essentially for statistically purposes you are considered employed. \nSo then I read every time it comes out I hear 5.3% unemployment. That is the biggest joke there is in this country. \nThat number is so false. \nAnd you know, people ask \u201cHow come Trump is doing so well? And Carson and others? How come they\u2019re doing -?\u201d You know why they\u2019re doing well? Because people are tired of political speak. They\u2019re tired of that. \nAnd the worst example of it \u2013 one of the worst example of it \u2013 is the phony unemployment rate. \nThe unemployment rate is probably 20%. But I will tell you you have some great economists that will tell you it\u2019s 30%, 32%. And the highest I\u2019ve heard so far is 42%. \nThere\u2019s anger out there at the job picture. \nNow, one of the things \u2013 with that being said, China, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, these countries are all taking our jobs like we\u2019re a bunch of babies. \nThat will stop. People will treat us fairly if I become President. \nWe\u2019re losing our jobs. We\u2019re losing our base. We\u2019re losing our manufacturing. \nAll of that will stop. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nIf a corporation gives out a bigger dividend, that\u2019s great. Mr. Jones gets a bigger dividend, he\u2019s going to have more money to spend in the economy. So that\u2019s good. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nI\u2019ve done a great job. I\u2019ve employed tens of thousands of people. I employ now thousands and thousands of people. I\u2019ve done a good job. \nBut I wouldn\u2019t say populist at all. I would say I\u2019m a man of common sense. \nI\u2019m cutting taxes. I\u2019m going to create a lot of jobs. I\u2019m going to get rid of a tremendous amount of waste. \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what. The waste that I get rid of \u2013 the waste that I get rid of \u2013 is going to have a huge impact and I\u2019m not even putting that in my numbers so I think it\u2019s going to be terrific. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nWhere are you from? England? I love them. Oh, what a beautiful accent. \nNo, I want to get the industry \u2013 we call it the automobile industry. \nBut I want to get the automobile industry to build factories here. \nAs you know, Ford is building $2.5 billion factory in Mexico. \nMexico also took a big plant out of Tennessee and Tennessee thought they were going to get it and they didn\u2019t. \nI want the motor companies, as you would say, or the automobile companies to build their plants in the United States. \nI don\u2019t want Nabisco leaving for Mexico or any place else. \nI want these companies not to leave Chicago, not to leave Michigan, not to leave New Hampshire and Iowa and South Carolina and all of these places where they\u2019re leaving and they\u2019re going to other countries. \nI want them to stay here and they will stay here and they\u2019ll be so happy. \nLadies and gentlemen, thank you very much. It\u2019s been a great honor. Thank you. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nShe says I have a habit when you get a bill, you\u2019d call up and you negotiate. To me, that\u2019s a compliment. \nNo, I want to take that thinking to the White House. I would bet you we could save 20% of our budget. I could even save more. But we could save a tremendous amount. \nThat has to be the attitude our country has. You can\u2019t spend millions and millions of dollars on doing something that you can do for $2,000. \nYou know, when you look at costs, we just spent $1 million building a soccer field. Okay? A soccer field for our prisoners that happen to be in Guantanamo. Okay? I don\u2019t like that. What do you need $1 million for? Level out the surface, let them play \u2013 if they had to play at all. Okay? What do you need to spend $1 million. \nWe just spent \u2013 it\u2019s a story today. $1 million on a soccer field. How do you spend $1 million doing a soccer field? You have a level piece of land. Throw them a ball if they have to play soccer \u2013 if they have to play at all. Why are they playing soccer is my question. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd I think one of the reasons I am doing so well in the polls and one of the reasons I\u2019m doing so well when it comes to the economy in all polls is that this is the thinking. \nNo, we\u2019re lowering taxes very substantially. We\u2019re simplifying. And we\u2019re getting rid of deductions that are actually obselete that certain people want to keep for certain reasons. \nSo, no, that\u2019s not true. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nScott Pelley interviewed me. I thought Scott was terrific. I mean, it was a tough interview but I thought he was very fair and I thought the piece was very good. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd again it\u2019s called corporate inversion and in a lot of time corporations are moving out and they\u2019re going to other countries, taking jobs. \nAnd now, we have a really big problem because we have serious companies \u2013 very large, very prestigious companies as you know \u2013 obviously you know something about business. But we have major companies looking to move out of the United States. \nYou know, it used to be they\u2019d move from New York to Florida. They\u2019d move from New Jersey to Texas. Or whatever. \nNow, they\u2019re talking about moving from the United States to Ireland and to England and to other places, to Spain where they get treated differently and frankly better. \nAnd they\u2019re doing that for a number of reasons but one of the reasons \u2013 one of the big reasons \u2013 as you know is taxes. One of the other reasons is to get all of this cash that they\u2019ve built up and they can\u2019t get back into our country. \nAnd when this money comes back into our country that everybody wants, it\u2019s going to be put to work in our country, largely. It can go other places. But largely. \nAnd I think it will be an amazing boon. \nNow, here\u2019s the other thing. They think it\u2019s $2.5 trillion. I think it\u2019s much more than that. \nI actually think it\u2019s going to be more money than that. And boy if it is, we have hit pay dirt.  \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd by the way, if we have more than 3%, these numbers are really spectacular. \nAnd one of the things that they don\u2019t take into account in any big league fashion is the cutting. There is so much waste in government and I believe when I get in there I\u2019ll be able to cut without losing anything to cut tremendous amounts off of the \u2013 and we\u2019re not even showing anything for that. \nSo, they\u2019re very conservative numbers. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nWhen I do my return, it will be much \u2013 my return go up to the ceiling and beyond, which is ridiculous. And you spend millions of dollars at a high level on lawyers, accountants, and everything else. \nWe want to simplify them to a tremendous level. \nThe bracket of 25% \u2013 the big difference is many of the loopholes and many of the deductions which are all \u2013 they\u2019ve been there for years \u2013 are antiquated in many cases. \nOr are put there because a lot of the people that get these deductions are contributed to Hillary, they\u2019re contributing to Bush. They\u2019re contributing to every candidate but Trump. Because I\u2019m not taking any money. I\u2019m self-funding. And these people want these deductions. \nThere will be people \u2013 we\u2019re reducing taxes. But believe me, there will be people in the very upper eschelons that won\u2019t be thrilled with this. \nWe\u2019re taking away deductions and that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re able to lower it. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nI believe that the economy will do so well that even though they won\u2019t be getting certain deductions which aren\u2019t fair for them to be getting that they\u2019ll end up doing better. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nI think this is a common sense, well thought out tax proposal that\u2019s going to trigger the economy, going to make everybody go back and really want to work. \nIt\u2019s going to create tremendous numbers of jobs. \nOne of the other things that I\u2019m coupling this with is if I become President, I\u2019m going to renegotiate our trade deals. Because our trade deals are not sustainable by this country. Not sustainable. \nWe cannot continue to let our jobs go to all of the different countries. There\u2019s not a country that we negotiate with that doesn\u2019t make a better deal. Everybody. \nWe lose money with everything. \nI\u2019m also going to renegotiate some of our military costs. Because we protect South Korea, we protect Germany, we protect some of the wealthiest countries in the world \u2013 Saudi Arabia \u2013 we protect everybody. We protect everybody. \nAnd we don\u2019t get reimbursement. We lose on everything. We lose on everything. \nSo, we\u2019re going to negotiate and renegotiate trade deals, military deals, many other deals that\u2019s going to get the costs down for running our country very significantly. I\u2019m not showing a big number in that. But I believe that if I become President, those numbers are going to be massive. \nAs an example, Saudi Arabia. They make $1 billion a day. We protect them. \nSo we need help. \nWe\u2019re losing a tremendous amount of money on a yearly basis and we owe $19 trillion. \nI used to say $18 trillion for the last 6, 7 months; now it\u2019s $19 trillion and it\u2019s only going up. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nIn the NBC poll, I think we went from 26% to 29%. We\u2019re going up very strongly in the polls. They don\u2019t know what to do about it. \nI\u2019ve built a great company. You\u2019ll see that in 60 Minutes last night. I built a great company. It\u2019s a phenomenal company with very little debt, tremendous cash flow. \nI\u2019m funding my own campaign. \nGuys like Rubio, I mean, he desperately needs money. Ask the car dealer in Florida. Ask the people that support him. \nAnd a guy like Rubio and others \u2013 I don\u2019t want to single him out; you\u2019re singling him out \u2013 but they\u2019re largely controlled by their donors, the special interests, and frankly more than anybody else, the lobbyists. \nI\u2019ve turned down millions of millions of dollars from lobbyists and special interests because it\u2019s not the right thing. It\u2019s just not right. And that seems to be resonating very strongly. \nThe number is probably $2.5 trillion. \nEverybody agrees it should come back \u2013 Republicans, Democrats, everybody. \nThey can\u2019t make a deal. They don\u2019t know how to go about making a deal. \nThe reason companies aren\u2019t bringing it back is the tax is onerous. It doesn\u2019t make sense to bring it back. \nAnd in fact, many companies are leaving the United States. They\u2019re leaving our shores to go and collect their money. \nThey\u2019re going actually moving out of the United States for two reasons \u2013 the taxes are too high and because they have tremendous amounts of money that they can\u2019t bring back into this country when everybody wants them to bring it back in. \nIt\u2019s called leadership. \nWe will have that money brought back in. \nAs an example, I have millions of dollars overseas. I can\u2019t bring it back into this country. We filed papers. We\u2019ve been doing this for a year and a half. We can\u2019t get it back in. \nSo the money stays in other countries and that\u2019s what happens. Not good for us. \nThe level of leadership that we need to get things like this done is so important. But this is something \u2013 and I\u2019ve been watching it for a long time \u2013 everybody agrees to. \nWe also reduce or eliminate some business loopholes \u2013 many of them actually \u2013 and deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on business income. \nThe tax rate now is so low that a lot of these deductions which are complicated, which don\u2019t make sense, and which are unfair are gone. \nAnd we phase in a reasonable cap on the deductability of the business interest expense. \nSo we are going to give you \u2013 we have a very complex set of papers that actually if you know business is not so complex. And we\u2019re going to hand them out right now to the press. \nAnd I think you\u2019ll see we have an amazing code. It will be simple. It will be easy. It will be fair. \nIt\u2019s graduated. As you get up in income, you pay a little more. \nSome of the very unfair deductions that certain people have been given who make a lot of money will not be available any longer. \nBut I actually believe they\u2019ll do better because I think the economy will grow. It will grow rapidly. And we\u2019ll have something very special. \nNow, with all of that being said and before we take some questions, we have to cut the costs of what\u2019s going on in this country. \nIf you look at what we\u2019re doing and the money we\u2019re spending. I read where a washer \u2013 you know what a washer is? Nuts, bolts, and washer \u2013 to send from one state to another, it was a 19 set washer and it cost $900,000 and some odd dollars to send it from here to there. \nAnd there are many examples. Hammers that cost $800 that you can buy in the store for a tiny amount of money. \nWe will run this country properly. There is so much money to be saved. \nWe\u2019re reducing taxes but at the same time if I win, if I become President, we will be able to cut so much money and have a better country. \nWe won\u2019t be losing anything other than we\u2019ll be balancing budgets and getting them where they should be. \nSo, this is a plan that\u2019s simple, that\u2019s a major reduction. I think people are going to be very happy. We\u2019ve already had some very good reviews. \nI did the plan with some of the leading scholars and economists and tax experts that there are in this country. They love it; they say \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t this been done before?\u201d \nAnd this is my wheelhouse. That\u2019s what I do well. \nThe economy is what I do well. Whenever they do polls, I always come out way above everybody else on the economy and on leadership, by the way, but I won\u2019t say that. \nSo, if anybody has \u2013 [applause] \u2013 thank you. That\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s some of the press was actually clapping. I\u2019ve never saw \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen that before. \nAll right. Why don\u2019t we take some questions from the press? \nSo, we\u2019re going to be discussing something so important for our country, for our economy, and for getting us all working again and working well again. \nIt\u2019s a tax reform that I think will make America strong and great again. \nToo few Americans are working. Too many jobs are being shipped overseas. And too many middle income families cannot make ends meet. \nThis plan directly meets these challenges and the challenges also of business. \nIt will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans. There will be a major tax reduction. \nIt will simplify the tax code. It will grow the American economy at a level it hasn\u2019t seen for decades. \nAnd all of this does not add to our debt or our deficit. \nBut I will also be discussing some of that at the end because we have to make much better deals, we have to negotiate much harder, and we\u2019ve got to make our economy strong. \nChanges for individuals will be at levels that you haven\u2019t seen in a long time. \nWe\u2019re going to cut the individual rates from 7 brackets to 4. Simplification. 25%, 20%, 10%, and 0%. \nIf you\u2019re single and earn less than $25,000 per year or married and jointly earn less than $50,000 \u2013 so, very important. If you\u2019re single and earn less than $25,000 or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you\u2019ll not pay any income tax \u2013 nothing. \nThis eliminates very strongly and quickly the marriage penalty. Very unfair penalty. \nIt eliminates the AMT, which is the alternative minimum tax. \nIt ends the death tax. It\u2019s a double taxation. A lot of families go through hell over the death tax. \nIt reduces or eliminates most of the deductions and loopholes available to special interests or to the very rich \u2013 in other words, it\u2019s going to cost me a fortune, which is actually true \u2013 while preserving charitable giving and mortagage interest deductions. Very importantly. \nIt ends the current tax treatment of carried interest. Those are the hedge fund folks that I\u2019ve been talking about for quite a while. They make a lot of money. Carried interest. \nSo it ends the current tax treatment of carried interest through speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital. \nChanges for business \u2013 now, so important, because it\u2019s all about business. It\u2019s all about jobs. \nWe have 93 million people in this country that are in serious trouble, that want to work; they can\u2019t work. \nSo for business, no business of any size from a Fortune 500 company to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living from gig to gig will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Big reduction. \nA one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at significantly discount which coming back at a significantly discount \u2013 10%. So it comes back discounted at a 10% tax rate and ends the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad. \nNow, it\u2019s called corporate inversion. It\u2019s a huge subject. \nI\u2019ve been watching politicians now for years \u2013 all talk, no action politicians. I\u2019ve been watching them for years talking about bringing this money back. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech at the 2016 AIPAC conference", "text": "And you see that happening all the time. That pattern practiced by the president and his administration including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is a total disaster by the way. She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly. \nBut it has repeated itself over and over again and has done nothing to embolden those who hate America. We saw that with releasing the $150 billion to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community. It didn\u2019t happen. \nPresident Obama thinks that apply pressure to Israel will force the issue but it\u2019s precisely the opposite that happens. Already, half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS and Hamas, and the other half refuses to confront the first half. So it\u2019s a very difficult situation that\u2019s never going to get solved unless you have great leadership right here in the United States. \nWe\u2019ll get it solved one way or the other. We will get it solved. \nBut when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially. That\u2019s what will happen when Donald Trump is president of the United States. \nWe will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. \nAnd we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the state of Israel. \nThe Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel. They must do that. \nAnd they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish state and it will forever exist as a Jewish state. \nI love the people in this room. I love Israel. I love Israel. I\u2019ve been with Israel so long in terms of I\u2019ve received some of my greatest honors from Israel. My father before me \u2013 incredible. \nMy daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby. In fact, it could be happening right now, which would be very nice as far as I\u2019m concerned. \nSo I want to thank you very much. This has been a truly great honor. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. \nTo make a great deal, you need two willing participants. We know Israel is willing to deal. Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years. \nYou had Camp David in 2000 where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer \u2013 maybe even too generous. Arafat rejected it. \nIn 2008, Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer. The Palestinian Authority rejected it also. \nThen John Kerry tried to come up with a framework and Abbas didn\u2019t even respond. Not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America. They didn\u2019t even respond. \nWhen I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second class citizen will end on day one. \nThank you. \nAnd when I say something I mean it. I mean it. \nI will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately. I have known him for many years and will be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region. \nMeanwhile, every single day you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate Israel and to hate the Jews. It has to stop. \nWhen you live in a society where the firefighters are the heroes, little kids want to be firefighters. When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars. \nIn Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews. We can\u2019t let this continue. We can\u2019t let this happen any longer. \nYou cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs. Glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace. It is a horrible, horrible way to think. It\u2019s a barrier that can\u2019t be broken. That will end and it will end soon. Believe me. \nIn Palestinian textbooks and mosques, you\u2019ve got a culture of hatred that has been fermenting there for years. And if we want to achieve peace, they\u2019ve got to go out and they\u2019ve got to start this educational process. They have to end education of hatred. They have to end it and now. \nThere is no moral equivalency. Israel does not name public squares after terrorists. Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians. \nYou see, what President Obama gets wrong about dealmaking is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies. \nLet me be clear. An agreement imposed by the United Nations would be a total and complete disaster. \nThe United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which I will use as president, 100%. \nWhen people ask why? It\u2019s because that\u2019s not how you make a deal. \nDeals are made when parties come together. They come to a table and they negotiate. Each side must give up something. It\u2019s values. I mean, we have to do something where there\u2019s value in exchange for something that it requires. That\u2019s what a deal is. \nA deal is really something that when we impose it on Israel and Palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something that\u2019s not going to happen with the United Nations. \nIt will only further \u2013 very importantly \u2013 it will only further de-legitimized Israel. It will be a catastrophe and a disaster for Israel. It\u2019s not going to happen, folks. \nAnd further, it would reward Palestinian terrorism because everyday they\u2019re stabbing Israelis and even Americans. \nJust last week, American Taylor Alan Force \u2013 a West Point grad, phenmomenal young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian. \nYou don\u2019t reward behavior like that. You cannot do it. \nThere\u2019s only way you treat that kind of behavior. You have to confront it. \nSo it\u2019s not up to the United Nations to really go with their solutions; it\u2019s really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves. They have no choice. They have to do it themselves or it will never hold up anyway. \nThe United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations but no one should be telling Israel that it must be \u2013 and really that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don\u2019t even really know what\u2019s happening to Israel, to anything in the area. It\u2019s so preposterous. We\u2019re not going to let that happen. \nWhen I\u2019m president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the U.N. to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100%. \nYou see, I know about dealmaking. That\u2019s what I do. I wrote the Art of the Deal \u2013 one of the best-selling all time \u2013 and I mean seriously I\u2019m saying one of because I\u2019ll be criticized if I say \u201cthe\u201d. So I\u2019m going to be very diplomatic. One of \u2013 I\u2019ll be criticized. I think it is number one but why take a chance? One of the all-time best-selling books about deals and dealmaking. \nThird, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal to hold Iran totally accountable and we will enforce it like you\u2019ve never seen a contract enforced before folks. Believe me. \nIran has already, since the deal has been in place, test fired ballistic missiles three times. \nThose ballistic missiles with a range of 1,250 miles were designed to intimidate not only Israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten Europe and someday maybe hit even the United States. And we\u2019re not going to let that happen. We\u2019re not letting it happen and we\u2019re not letting it happen to Israel. Believe me. \nThank you. Thank you. \nDo you want to hear something really shocking? As many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both Hebrew and Farsi were the words \u201cIsrael must be wiped off the face of the Earth. You can forget that. What kind of demented minds write that in Hebrew? \nAnd here\u2019s another. You talk about twisted? Here\u2019s another twisted part. \nTesting these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we\u2019ve made. The deal is silent on test missiles. But those tests do violate the United Nations Security Council Resolutions. \nThe problem is no one has done anything about it. We will. We will. I promise we will. \nThank you. \nWhich brings me to my next point \u2013 the utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations. \nThe United Nations is not a friend of democracy. It\u2019s not a friend of freedom. It\u2019s not a friend even to the United States of America, where as you know it has its home. And it surely is not a friend to Israel. \nWith President Obama in his final year \u2013 yay! \u2013 he may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel. Believe me. Believe me. And you know it. And you know it better than anybody. \nSo with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a Security Council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine. \nThe deal doesn\u2019t even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability. \nYes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years. But when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial size military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad Iran\u2019s behavior is. Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in and especially Israel. \nWhen I\u2019m president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. \nFirst, we will stand up to Iran\u2019s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region. \nIran is a very big problem and will continue to be. \nBut if I\u2019m not elected president, I know how to deal with trouble and, believe me, that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to be elected president, folks. And we are leading in every poll. Remember that please. \nIran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen, and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. \nLiterally everyday, Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states. \nHezbollah, Lebanon received and I\u2019ll tell you what \u2013 it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons, and GPS systems and rockets like very few people anywhere in the world and certainly very few countries have. Now they\u2019re in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. \nIn Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas and Islamic jihad. And in the West Bank, they\u2019re openly offering Palestinians $7,000 per terror attack and $30,000 for every Palestinian terrorist\u2019s home that\u2019s been destroyed. A deplorable, deplorable situation . \nIran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East and it\u2019s absolutely incredible that we handed them over $150 billion to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror. \nSecondly, we will totally dismantle Iran\u2019s global terror network, which is big and powerful but not powerful like us. \nIran has seeded terror groups all over the world. During the last five years, Iran has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents. They\u2019ve got terror cells everywhere, including in the western hemisphere very close to home. \nIran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach. Believe me, believe me.\n... \nThank you very much. I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel. \nI\u2019m a newcomer to politics but not to backing the Jewish state. \nIn 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City and on Washington and frankly the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated and they were prepetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims. I sent my plane because I backed the mission for Israel 100%. \nIn spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the grand marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel Parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state. \nIt was a very dangerous time for Israel and frankly for anyone supporting Israel. Many people turned down this honor. I did not. I took the risk, and I\u2019m glad I did. \nBut I didn\u2019t come here tonight to pander to you about Israel. That\u2019s what politicians do. All talk, no action \u2013 believe me. \nI came here to speak to you about where I stand on the future of American relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship and our cultural brother, the only democracy in the Middle East \u2013 the state of Israel. \nThank you. \nMy number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. \nThank you. Thank you. \nI have been in business a long time. I know dealmaking. And let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic for America, for Israel, and for the whole of the Middle East. \nThe problem here is fundamental. We\u2019ve rewarded the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terror with $150 billion and we received absolutely nothing in return. \nI\u2019ve studied this issue in great detail. I would say actually greater by far than anybody else. Believe me. Oh, believe me. \nAnd it\u2019s a bad deal. \nThe biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it because already, you know, as you know it has. \nThe bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. And of course, they\u2019ll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s press conference remarks", "text": "And what I\u2019d do if we did this debate, I\u2019d like to do something similar where they\u2019ll pay \u2013 in this case, it\u2019ll be just the payment by the networks. I mean, why should the networks have a debate like this, make a fortune, sell it to sponsors, and put the money in their coffers. I would much rather give and probably in this case to various groups involved with women\u2019s health issues. I think it\u2019s appropriate. Okay? \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWe\u2019ll have a lot of things to do. We\u2019re going to start rebuilding our military. We have no choice. We have no choice. It\u2019s not like \u201cOh gee, do you want to do it?\u201d We\u2019re going to make our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before. \nI saw the other day actually on CNN but where the jet fighters we\u2019re using parts from museums and graveyards \u2013 plane graveyards \u2013 where they\u2019re taking old parts for our fighters for F-16s. \nAnd they were interviewing some of the pilots. These were great people, and they were saying they were so embarrassed and so ashamed of what\u2019s going on. This shouldn\u2019t be the United States. \nSo we\u2019re going to rebuild our military. We\u2019re going to have the finest equipment in the world again. And nobody\u2019s going to mess with us. Very simple. \nAnd by the way, I\u2019m the last person in terms of the draw \u2013 I don\u2019t have to worry about the draw. I\u2019m the last person. \nI didn\u2019t want to go into Iraq, unlike Hillary and other people, and we shouldn\u2019t have gone into Iraq. Iraq was a mistake. And then the way Obama got us out was a tremendous mistake. \nSo we\u2019re going to have a lot of fun that first 100 days. We\u2019re going to start the process of making America great again. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd again, this was something that was going to happen according to some people in August and some people were saying because of the second convention, which would have been ridiculous. \nAnd many people said it was going to go into the July and we had that massive victory in Indiana. I won\u2019t forget the people of Indiana. Believe me, that was a massive, massive victory. And you know, here I am sitting. \nAnd I\u2019m watching \u2013 I love watching Hillary and Bernie go at it. In fact, Bernie\u2019s given me some great lines, which I\u2019m using, believe me. \nBut I will say that as far as building the infrastructure of a campaign, the RNC has been doing it for many years. Reince has really upped it and all over the country they have very good people. And part of the benefit is we get to use those people. \nAnd while I\u2019m raising a lot of money for them and they\u2019re going to use that not only for me, they\u2019re going to use that also for other people running for office, it\u2019s really been an honor because I\u2019ve met some of the people in different states. \nI met a big group of people last night from different states that work essentially for the RNC. And you can\u2019t do that over a period of, you know, just a short while because you know, we have \u2013 November\u2019s coming up very rapidly. It\u2019s going to be really soon. And they are set up with some really great infrastructure. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nBut again, if you people reveal something to me, I\u2019ll answer the appropriate way. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nHillary is going to abolish the Second Amendment. Okay? Just in case you have any questions. She\u2019s going to abolish your right to own guns. She\u2019s going to abolish the Second Amendment. \nAnd I\u2019m exactly the opposite. And I got the endorsement the other day from the NRA, which was a great endorsement and a great honor for me because they are great, amazing people. I\u2019m a member of the NRA. My sons are members of the NRA. \nBut they want to absolutely knock out fracking. And you do that and you\u2019re going to be back in the Middle East and we\u2019re going to be begging for oil again. It\u2019s not going to happen, not with me. \nWe\u2019re going to open it up. We\u2019re going to be energy independent. We\u2019re going to have all sorts of energy. We\u2019re going to have everything you can think of, including solar. \nAnd I know a lot about solar. The problem with solar is it\u2019s very expensive. It doesn\u2019t really \u2013 you know, when you have a 30 year payback that\u2019s not exactly the greatest thing in the world. \nBut I know a lot about solar and I\u2019ve gone solar on occasion. But it\u2019s a very, very expensive thing. \nWind is very expensive. I mean, wind is without subsidy, wind doesn\u2019t work. You need massive subsidies for wind. And there are places maybe for wind. \nBut if you go to various places in California, wind is killing all of the eagles. You know, if you shoot an eagle or you kill an eagle, they want to put you in jail for five years. And yet, the wind mills are killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles \u2013 one of the most beautiful, one of the most treasured birds and they\u2019re killing them by the hundreds. And nothing happens. \nSo wind is \u2013 it\u2019s a problem. Plus, it\u2019s very, very expensive and it doesn\u2019t work without subsidy. \nDespite that, I am into all types of energy. \nAnd by the way, while we\u2019re in North Dakota, I have to say this, I love the farmers and the farmers are incredible. We have to remember this was largely a farm state, and they produced tremendous crops of tremendous different goods of which I eat a lot of them. And I just want to pay my respects to the farmers of North Dakota because they have done a great job. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd people like Harold Hamm and people that I know that are really competent, super competent \u2013 believe me \u2013 we will make so much money from that, from energy because we\u2019re blessed with something and you\u2019ll hear some numbers in a little while. We\u2019ll make so much money that we will start to pay down our $19 trillion in debt and we\u2019ll start to lower taxes and we\u2019ll start to take care of our Social Security and our Medicare but we\u2019re going to open it up... \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd I will tell you, I made a speech last night in front of a group and I said regulation \u2013 and this surprised me, really surprised me \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it ever since I\u2019ve been doing this for like 10 months or so. Regulation is even more of a problem for people than the taxes, which surprised me. But they\u2019re both problems. \nSo we\u2019re going to lower \u2013 under my plan \u2013 we\u2019re lowering taxes very substantially as you know for businesses, for middle income, for everybody. So taxes are going way down. \nWe\u2019re going to allow trillions of dollars to pour into the country that are right now outside of this country where people and companies want to bring it in they can. \nAnd we\u2019re going to get rid of the tremendous numbers of rules, regulations, probably 75% of which are absolutely terrible for our country. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nShe tweets a lot about me. Every once in a while I\u2019ll tweet and when I tweet, not that many people are watching her tweets. When I tweet, they watch. \nI will say this. Look, she is a senator that\u2019s highly overrated. She\u2019s passed very little legislation. She has been a real disaster for a lot of people, including the Democrats who frankly can\u2019t stand her \u2013 many of the Democrats. Just ask Hillary Clinton how she likes her. \nAnd I would say this. I\u2019ll debate anybody. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d debate her. \nBut she\u2019s done very little for Massachusetts, and the beautiful thing is when I won Massachusetts with many people running against, I got up to almost 50% and she was fighting me. \nSo I really think if her record was exposed and the fact that she was a Native American \u2013 she said she was a Native American but she wasn\u2019t able to document it. She said, \u201cWell, I have high cheekbones. You see? I have high cheekbones so I\u2019m a Native American.\u201d \nAnd she then I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d call it a fraud or not. But she was able to get into various schools because of the fact she applied as a Native American and probably able to get other things. \nI think she\u2019s as Native American as I am. Okay? That I will tell you. \nBut she\u2019s a woman that\u2019s been very ineffective other than she\u2019s got a big mouth. Okay? \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nBut I felt I wasn\u2019t treated right. I did a speech and during the speech, I said let\u2019s see if we can raise some money for the vets and we raised a lot of money. \nOn Tuesday, I think we\u2019re going to have a press conference in Trump Tower \u2013 Tuesday at probably 10 a.m. or 11 a.m. and we\u2019re going to release a full list of all of the people \u2013 almost $6 million of money was raised. \nNow, when I started \u2013 well, when I started, we weren\u2019t going to raise anything. It was just an idea that came to me. And I said, \u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s raise some money for the vets.\u201d And one of my friends who was there \u2013 a very substantial person \u2013 Phil Ruffin offered $1 million. Carl Icahn gave $500,000. Somebody else \u2013 another good friend of mine \u2013 [incomprehensible audio] \u2013 I believe he gave $1 million. And all of a sudden, we started getting a lot of money and I loved seeing it. \nAnd on Tuesday, we\u2019re going to release a list of all of the different veterans\u2019 groups that got the money \u2013 pretty close to $6 million worth of money. And that was great. \nBut with the coal miners, they love doing what they\u2019re doing. And it\u2019s such an important product. \nHillary Clinton should not be putting them out of business. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd we also want to sell our energy to other places that don\u2019t have the great natural resources that we have. \nDon\u2019t forget. Through modern day technology, we found out that we\u2019re sitting on energy I\u2019m going to be talking about it in a minute. But that we\u2019re sitting on energy like nobody would believe. \nI want to be energy independent, and the answer is yes to your question. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nObama could never come up with a solution. Number one, he\u2019s incompetent. And number two, the solution just is never going to be out there for him. He won\u2019t even mention the words, radical Islamic terrorism. \nI have many Muslim friends. They said to me \u201cThank you. Thank you. This is a problem. It\u2019s a problem that have to get solved.\u201d \nAnd we have to have turn-ins. When you see people looking to do tremendous destruction like in California with the 14 people killed, they lived in a house where they had bombs all over the floor, everybody knew they were up to bad stuff. Nobody reported them. People have to report what they see. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI spoke to some of the mine owners and they were surrounded by some of their miners and they were showing me some of their regulations where it\u2019s on a daily basis going in, checking, checking, checking. And they have people that do nothing but deal with regulators. And it\u2019s out of control. It\u2019s gotten out of control. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nMarket forces \u2013 that\u2019s something I don\u2019t want to get involved. That\u2019s what\u2019s beautiful to me \u2013 market forces are beautiful forces. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nNow, I\u2019m not saying there shouldn\u2019t be a better deal. Obama would approve it or not approve it. Hillary is probably not going to approve it from what I understand. \nBut I look at it differently. I will absolutely approve it 100%. But I want a better deal because listen here\u2019s the difference between Harold Hamm and myself and you or let\u2019s say Obama, who doesn\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s doing. \nHere\u2019s the difference. I\u2019m going to say, \u201cFolks, we\u2019re going to let you build a pipeline. But give us a piece.\u201d We\u2019re going to have to use eminent domain. You know, remember when all the conservatives were \u201cEminent domain. Eminent domain.\u201d Well, their favorite project is the Keystone Pipeline, and if you read the documents on the Keystone Pipeline, a big section is devoted to eminent domain because without eminent domain, that pipeline wouldn\u2019t go 10 feet. You understand that. \nI want the Keystone Pipeline. But the people of the United States should be given a piece \u2013 a significant piece \u2013 of the profits. \nRight now, Obama would have said yes or no. And most politicians would say, \u201cYes, we\u2019ll approve it\u201d or \u201cNo, we won\u2019t.\u201d \nI\u2019m saying \u201cYes, we will absolutely approve it. I want it built. But I want a piece of the profits because we\u2019re making it possible for it to happen through eminent domain and other things, I want a piece of the profits for the United States.\u201d \nThat\u2019s how we\u2019re going to make our country rich again. Just one way out of thousands. But that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to make our country rich again and it\u2019s how we\u2019re going to make America great again. Okay, you understand what I\u2019m saying? \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI mean, the problem with debating with Bernie, he\u2019s going to lose. Because honestly, his system\u2019s rigged, just like our system\u2019s rigged. \nLook, if I didn\u2019t win my massive majorities, I wouldn\u2019t be standing here talking to you today. I mean, you know, I knocked out every opponent. You have to knock out. \nAnd Bernie, unfortunately, hasn\u2019t been able to knock out. But the super delegates for the Democrats \u2013 so unfair. I mean, it\u2019s so unfair. \nSo the biggest problem that I have is Bernie is not going to win. But I\u2019d debate him anyways if they wanted to put up money for charity. So we\u2019ll see. \nWe\u2019ve actually had a couple of calls from the networks already, and we\u2019ll see. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nLook, I\u2019m in first place...I\u2019d say something over $10 million. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nYou know, politicians are all talk no action. I\u2019ve created jobs and businesses and did great. But I\u2019ve never debated professionally. \nYou know, I ran against all these people and they debated professionally. But according to every single online poll after debates, I\u2019ve won every single debate by every single poll. \nSo I don\u2019t mind debating. I\u2019d like to debate...I said to myself I wonder how well I\u2019ll debate. You know because guys like this great gentleman right over here is one of the great oilmen of the world, we\u2019re not debaters. We\u2019re people that put people to work and do things and a lot of good things. \nHow many people do you have working for you? Tens of thousands. That\u2019s what he does. \nNow, I\u2019d rather debate Harold but I will tell you, he may surprise you. He may do very well. But we don\u2019t do that but somehow it worked out well for me. It worked out well for me. \nSo I actually love the debating process. A lot of fun. I was on center stage for every single debate. \nAnd the only time I was upset with some of the networks was when we had even numbers like eight. That means you had two in the middle. So I always insisted on having odd numbers. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nIn fact, my speech today is on energy. It\u2019s exactly what it was and is. \nThe federal government, the regulations that they have, they put the coal miners out of business. The coal mines are shut. What they\u2019ve done to the coal \u2013 \nWhat Hillary Clinton \u2013 she\u2019s worse than Obama. I mean, she actually openly said \u201cI want to put the coal miners out of business. I want to put the coal mines out of business.\u201d \nEssentially, she\u2019s saying \u201cI want to put the steel mills out of business.\u201d We\u2019re not going to have any businesses left. \nSo Hillary is I think \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine how she can possibly do well in a place like Pennsylvania. She certainly didn\u2019t do very well in West Virginia. \nAnd you know, I think she made a big mistake. She\u2019s catering to certain people but I think ultimately jobs and these incredible people \u2013 the miners, they\u2019re incredible people. \nI asked a couple of them \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go into some different profession?\u201d They said, \u201cBecause we love going after coal.\u201d I\u2019ll never forget the answer. \nYou know, you think it\u2019s dangerous and you\u2019re going deep down into these incredible crevices. I say \u201cWow.\u201d But they love doing what they do. That\u2019s what they do. \nI\u2019m also continuing to fund big portions of my campaign. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI have to say the IRS has been very professional and they continue to be very professional. And when they finish \u2013 I\u2019ve been audited, however, for 15 years and I don\u2019t know very many people that have been audited for 15 years. I\u2019m audited all the time so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s that all about. But the IRS has been very professional. And as we move along, as soon as that\u2019s finished, whenever that may be \u2013 and hopefully that\u2019s going to be before the election, I\u2019m fine with it. Okay? \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nLook, she has bad judgment. This was all bad judgment. Probably illegal. We have to find out what the FBI says about it. But certainly it was bad judgment. \nI just read the report. It\u2019s devastating the report. It\u2019s devastating. And there\u2019s no reason for it. It\u2019s just, you know, skirting on the edge all the time. And you look back at her history and this is her history. \nIt\u2019s a very, very harsh report done really by Democrats, if you think of it. Appointed by Obama and done by Democrats. \nSo, it\u2019s shocking to see and it\u2019s shocking to see what she did. And really, more than anything else, it\u2019s bad judgment. \nBut that\u2019s going to be up to her whether or not she wants to continue running. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nIf you look at what\u2019s happened, tremendous support from all over the country \u2013 senators, congressmen, we have governors all over the place. And vast majorities \u2013 I think the approval now is up to over 90%. That\u2019s tremendous from where I started. You know, a little while ago it was like 62%. \nBut I won the elections in landslides. You know, very important to say when you look at these elections. \nWe go to New York, we win almost 62% of the vote with three people running. \nWe then go to Pennsylvania, which is I think a state we\u2019re going to do amazingly well. You know, Hillary Clinton wants to put the coal miners out of business. They want to put the steel mills out of business. I think I\u2019m going to win Pennsylvania easily. We have tremendous support there. \nMaryland, Connecticut, we win Delaware, Rhode Island. And then we win as you know I mean we had a tremendous, a tremendous success when we went to Indiana. That was incredible. Bobby Knight helped in all fairness. But Indiana, we\u2019re going win Indiana I think very big. \nWe\u2019re going to have tremendous successes. \nYou know, the thing I think I\u2019m most proud of not the fact that I\u2019m watching Hillary instead of Hillary watching me. \nYou know, we were supposed to be going into July and a lot of people said it wouldn\u2019t even self doing that convention. There\u2019s going to be a new convention in August. And here I am watching Hillary fight and she can\u2019t close the deal and that should be an easy deal to close. But she\u2019s unable to close the deal. So I\u2019m watching her and we\u2019ll see what happens. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd I spoke with Paul Ryan last night. We had a very good conversation that\u2019s moving along. He\u2019s a good man and we\u2019ll see how that all works out. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI want to thank a very good friend of mine, Harold Hamm. I guess we can consider Harold the king of energy. There\u2019s nobody like him. I\u2019ll tell you, he knows more about it than anybody that I know. \nSo Harold, I want to thank you for your support. You\u2019ve been amazing right from the beginning. My friend for a long time. \nAnd I have been on the cover of every magazine. I think he\u2019s been had as many covers as I have. Maybe more, Harold? So congratulations and thank you very much for your support. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWhen you rattle someone, that\u2019s good. Because many of the world \u2013 as you know, many of the countries in our world \u2013 our beautiful world \u2013 have been absolutely abusing us and taking advantage of us. \nSo if they\u2019re rattled in a friendly way \u2013 we\u2019re going to have great relationships with these countries \u2013 but if they\u2019re rattled in a friendly way that\u2019s a good thing...not a bad thing. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd it\u2019s unusual that every time he has a press conference he\u2019s talking about me. So it\u2019s just one of those things. \nBut I will say this: He is a man who shouldn\u2019t be really airing his difficulties and he shouldn\u2019t be airing what he\u2019s airing where he is right now, and I think that you\u2019re going to see it stop pretty soon. He has not done a good job. \nToday, we\u2019re giving a big speech on energy. We\u2019re going to see some amazing things happen with our country on energy, and I look forward to doing it. \nBut President Obama, you know, you see what\u2019s happened. You see where we\u2019re going. We\u2019re a divided country. We have tremendous difficulties, tremendous problems. And we\u2019re going to solve those problems and we\u2019re going to solve them fast. Okay? \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nSo I look forward to it and I know he was misquoted a couple of times. He\u2019s been misquoted actually a lot. But we\u2019re going to have women involved at the absolute highest levels. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWe raised last night actually we raised in Los Angeles, we raised a lot of money for the party and this is money that\u2019s going into the RNC. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in West Palm Beach, Florida", "text": "And I say to the African-American community, what the hell do you have to lose? I will fix it. I will fix it. I will make it good. I\u2019ll bring back our jobs. We\u2019ll have good education. We\u2019ll have great safety in the inner city. \nAnd we will help the Hispanic American people who have been treated so badly and so unfairly in our nation. We will help them. \nI will deliver like you\u2019ve never seen before. I deliver. Whether people like Donald Trump or not, they all say he delivers. \nVote for Donald Trump and you\u2019re going to see something. And you\u2019ll be so happy. You\u2019ll be so thrilled. \nThis election is about every man, woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety, prosperity, and peace. So true. \nWe will rise above the lies, the smears, the ludicrous from ludicrous and very, very dishonest reporters. \nWe will vote for the country we want. We will vote for the future we want. We will vote for the politics we want. \nAnd we will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business and out of business immediately. \nWe will vote for the special interests and say lots of luck but you\u2019re being voted out of power. They betrayed our workers. They betrayed our borders. And most of all, they betrayed our freedoms. \nWe will save our sovereign rights as a nation. We will end the politics of profit. We will end the rule of special interests. We will end the raiding of our jobs by other countries. \nWe will end the total disenfranchisement of the American voter and the American worker. \nOur independence day is at hand and it arrives finally on Nov. 8th. \nJoin me in taking back our country and creating a bright, glorious, and prosperous new future for our people. We will make America great again and it will happen quickly. \nGod bless you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. \nNo other successful person after watching this and not other very successful person will ever again ever and who can blame them? Even me, I\u2019d say you\u2019re right. Will ever again run for office. \nI\u2019ve heard it for years. If you\u2019re very successful you can\u2019t run for higher office, especially for president. \nI said, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve done so many deals. I\u2019ve done so well. It\u2019s a certain mindset we need in our country at least for a period of time. We have to straighten our country out. \nI will not lie to you. These false attacks are absolutely hurtful. \nTo be lied about, to be slandered, to be smeared so publicly and before your family that you love is very painful. \nWhat is going on is egregious beyond any words. People that know the story, people that see the story, people that know the facts they can\u2019t even believe it. \nIt\u2019s reprehensible beyond description. It\u2019s totally corrupt. \nBut I also know that it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about all of you and it\u2019s about our country. I know that. I fully understand that. That\u2019s why I got involved. \nIt\u2019s about all of us together as a country. It\u2019s a movement the likes of which we have never in history in this country seen before. Never in history. \nEven the pundits, even the media that truly dislike Donald Trump for their own reasons will admit this is a movement the likes of which people have never seen before. \nAnd it\u2019s a movement about the veterans who need medical care, the mothers who\u2019ve lost their beloved children to terrorism and to crime. \nIt\u2019s about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help. \nIt\u2019s about the millions of jobless people in America. \nIt\u2019s about the American workers who can\u2019t get jobs because our jobs have left for Mexico and so many other countries. \nThis election is about the people being crushed by Obamacare. \nAnd it\u2019s about defeating ISIS and appointing a Supreme Court and a Supreme Court \u2013 it could be four or five \u2013 who will defend and protect our Constitution. \nThis election is also about so importantly to me African-American and Hispanic American people whose communities have been plunged into crime, poverty, and failing schools by the policies of crooked Hillary Clinton. Believe me, she\u2019s crooked. \nThey\u2019ve robbed these citizens of their future and if we win I will give them their hope, their jobs, their education. I give them their security back. \nThe inner cities \u2013 education is almost worthless. It\u2019s horrible. We\u2019re going to have Common Core ended. We\u2019re going to bring education local. \nBut you look at the inner cities and you see bad education, no jobs, no safety. You walk to the grocery store with your child and you get shot. You walk outside to look and see what\u2019s happening and you get shot. \nIn Chicago, 3,000 people have been shot since Jan. 1st. We\u2019re not going to let that  happen. \nOur inner cities are almost at an all-time low run by the Democrats for sometimes more than 100 years chain unbroken. So they have no jobs. They have horrible education. They have no safety or security. \nAnd yet after reading all of these items where she\u2019s so guilty, he let her off the hook while other lives including General Petraeus and many others have been destroyed for doing far, far less. \nThis is a conspiracy against you the American people and we cannot let this happen or continue. \nThis is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization itself. \nI didn\u2019t need to do this, folks, believe me. Believe me. \nI built a great company and I had a wonderful life. I could have enjoyed the fruits and benefits of years of successful business deals and businesses for myself and for my family instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions, malicious attacks. Who would have thought? \nI\u2019m doing it because this country has given me so much and I feel so strongly that it\u2019s my turn to give back to the country that I love. \nMany of my friends and many political experts warned me that this campaign would be a journey to hell. Said that. But they\u2019re wrong. \nIt will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people that are so desperately in need of help. \nIn my former life, I was an insider as much as anybody else and I knew what it\u2019s like and I still know what it\u2019s like to be an insider. It\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s not bad. \nNow, I\u2019m being punished for leaving the special club and revealing to you the terrible things that are going on having to do with our country. \nBecause I used to be part of the club, I\u2019m the only one that can fix it. \nI\u2019m doing this for the people and for the movement and we will take back this country for you and we will make America great again. \nThe corrupt establishment knows that we are a great threat to their criminal enterprise. They know that if we win, their power is gone and it\u2019s returned to you the people \u2013 will be. \nThe dark clouds hanging over our government can be lifted and replaced with a bright future. \nBut it all depends on whether we let the corrupt media decide our future or whether we let the American people decide our future. \nIf this Clinton campaign of destruction is allowed to work then, no other highly successful \u2013 and this is so true. I\u2019ve seen this so many times and I\u2019ve heard this all of my life. I\u2019ve heard it all of my life. \nIf we let this happen, then no other highly successful person, which is what our country needs. It needs a certain thinking when you look at our trade deals that are so bad. \nWhen you look as an example, on trade, we\u2019re going to lose almost $800 billion this year trade deficit. Almost $800 billion. \nOur debt has doubled in 7.5 years to almost $20 trillion under Obama. \nThey will allow the great Trojan Horse and I don\u2019t want people looking back in 100 years and 200 years and have that story be told about us because we were led by inept, incompetent and corrupt people like Barack Obama and like Hillary Clinton. \nWe don\u2019t want to be part of that history. \nAnd by the way, President Obama should stop campaigning and start working on creating jobs, start working on getting our GDP up, start working on strengthening our borders. \nThe corrupt political establishment is a machine. It has no soul. \nI knew these false attacks would come. I knew this day would arrive. It was only a question of when. And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve. \nThe only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you. The only force strong enough to save our country is us. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is the American people. \nWe are going to have a policy \u2013 America first. \nThey control incredibly the Department of Justice. And they even secretly meet with the Attorney General of the United States in the back of her airplane while on the runway. Remember? He was there. He was going to play golf. \n\u201cOh gee, there\u2019s the Attorney General. Let me go say hello. Plane\u2019s on the runway. Let me go say hello to the Attorney General.\u201d \nHe never got to play golf, I understand. And it was Arizona, a place I love but the weather was about 100 and some odd degree. No, he\u2019s not going to play. He was never there to play golf, folks. Don\u2019t be foolish. \nThey met for 39 minutes and most likely it was to discuss her reappointment in a Clinton administration as the Attorney General just prior to making a decision over whether or not to prosecute Hillary Clinton. Okay? That\u2019s what happened. That\u2019s called real life and that\u2019s pretty sad. \nThey met for 39 minutes. Remember he said, \u201cWe talked golf and we talked about our grandchildren.\u201d \nThree minutes for the grandchildren. Two minutes for the golf. \nThen they sat there then they twiddled their thumbs. \nNo, I believe they talked about her remaining in her position under a crooked Hillary Clinton administration. That\u2019s what I believe. That\u2019s what I believe, folks. That\u2019s what I believe and I think that\u2019s what most people in this room believe. \nLikewise they have essentially corrupted the director of the FBI to the point in which stories are already saying that the great \u2013 and they are truly great \u2013 men and women who work for the FBI are embarrassed and ashamed of what he\u2019s done to one of our truly great institutions \u2013 the FBI itself. \nHillary Clinton is guilty of all the things that Director Comey stated at his press conference and congressional hearings and far more. He stated many things but it\u2019s far more and he knows that. \nAnd who would have done that if you\u2019re doing this and you\u2019re one of the top shows on television? \nThese people are horrible people. They\u2019re horrible, horrible liars. \nAnd interestingly, it happens to appear 26 days before our very important election. Isn\u2019t that amazing? \nThis invented account has already been debunked by eyewitnesses who were there. They were there. \nThe very witness identified by the author has said the story is totally false. By the way, this was a room that everybody can see in. It\u2019s got glass walls. At Mar-e-Lago. It\u2019s got glass walls. \nCan you believe this? Why wasn\u2019t it in the story? Biggest story of the year? \nThis weekend, the New York Times published a full-page hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the many, many emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years looking for work. \u201cDonald is great.\u201d Wanting to go to my rallies. \nBut the New York Times and this was a full op-ed piece refused to use the evidence that we presented, refused to use. If they used it, if they would have looked, they would have said \u201cOh, there\u2019s no story here.\u201d \nOthers in the media, which almost surprises me because they\u2019re dishonest also, were presented with this story by this woman numerous times and they got very excited. But after seeing the evidence that we immediately give them, all of them refused to write the story. There was no story. \nThe Times, though, they didn\u2019t want to say it. They just wrote the story. And this was a full page opposite the editorials. \nThis is part of a concerted effort led by the New York Times and others \u2013 now the New York Times is fighting desperately for its relevance and its financial survival and it probably won\u2019t be around in a few years based on its financial outlook, which wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing if you want to know the truth. \nBut as it winds down its years and is becoming more and more problematic, it\u2019s gotten more and more vicious, more and more vile, and even the other mainstream media is talking about the single greatest pile-on in history and all between now and Nov. 8th. \nAnd you have to see the stories they\u2019ve written. It\u2019s one after another after another. And facts mean nothing. Third rate journalism. \nThe great editors from the past from the New York Times and others, ladies and gentlemen, are spinning in their grave. \nI will not allow the Clinton machine to turn our campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies but will remain focused on the issues facing the American people. \nThank you. Thank you. \nBut let me state this as clearly as I can. These attacks are orchestrated by the Clintons and their media allies. \nThe only thing Hillary Clinton has going for herself is the press. Without the press, she is absolutely zero. \nAnd you saw that the other night in the debate where some people said she made virtually a fool of herself. This is not presidential material, believe me. \nWhat they say is false and slanderous in virtually every respect. We are now less than a month from the most important election of our lifetime. Indeed, one of the most important elections in the history of our country. \nAnd the polls are showing us in a dead heat. Don\u2019t believe what you hear. \nThese claims are all fabricated. They\u2019re pure fiction and they\u2019re outright lies. \nThese events never ever happened and the people that said meekly fully understand. You take a look at these people. You study these people, and you\u2019ll understand also. \nThe claims are preposterous, ludicrous, and defy truth, common sense, and logic. \nWe already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies and it will be made public in an appropriate way and at an appropriate time. \nThese lies come from outlets whose past stories and past claims have already been discredited. \nThe media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts because even a simple investigation would have shown that these were nothing more than false smears. \nSix months ago, the failing New York Times wrote a massive story attacking me and the central witness they used said the story was false, that she was quoted inaccurately. She said that I was a great guy. She had great courage, I\u2019ll be honest with you. She was an amazing person and never made those remarks. That I was a great guy and never made those remarks. \nAnd when I read the story, I was sort of surprised. How could she say that? And she didn\u2019t say it. We demanded a retraction but they refused to print it. \nJust like they refused to print the comments from another source who praised me in her book or the words of another wonderful woman who said really nice things about me. They put other statements that she didn\u2019t say. They misrepresented. \nThe story was a fraud and a big embarrassment to the New York Times and it was a big front page story \u2013 front page, center, color picture \u2013 a disgrace. They were very embarrassed. \nIt will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them. \nNow today, the same two discredited writers who should have been fired from the New York Times for what they did tell another totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place on an airplane more than 30 years ago. \nAnother ridiculous tale. No witnesses. No nothing. \nThen there was a writer from People Magazine who wrote a story on Melania and myself on our first anniversary. The story was beautiful. It was beautiful. It was lovely. \nBut last night we hear that after 12 years \u2013 this took place 12 years ago this story \u2013 a new claim that I made inappropriate advances during the interview to this writer. \nAnd I ask a very simple question. Why wasn\u2019t it part of the story that appeared 20 or 12 years ago? Why wasn\u2019t it a part of the story? Why didn\u2019t they make it part of the story? \nI was one of the biggest stars on television with The Apprentice and it would have been one of the biggest stories of the year. \nThink of it. She\u2019s doing this story on Melania, who\u2019s pregnant at the time, and Donald Trump \u2013 our one-year anniversary. And she said I made inappropriate advances. \nAnd by the way, the area was a public area. People all over the place. \nTake a look. You take a look. Look at her. Look at her words. You tell me what you think. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. \nBut it is amazing. Doing a story \u2013 a love story \u2013 on how great we are together. And by the way, we\u2019re stronger today than we were ever were before, which is great. \nBut it\u2019s a love story. It\u2019s a love story on our one-year. And if I did that, she would have added that. It would have been the headline. \nThey\u2019re a political special interest, no different than any other lobbyist or other financial entity with a total political agenda and the agenda is not for you, it\u2019s for themselves. \nAnd their agenda is to elect crooked Hillary Clinton at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy. \nFor them, it\u2019s a war, and for them nothing at all is out of bounds. \nThis is a struggle for the survival of our nation. Believe me. \nAnd this will be our last chance to save it on Nov. 8th. Remember that. \nThis election will determine whether we are a free nation or whether we have only the illusion of democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests, rigging the system. And our system is rigged. \nThis is reality. You know it. They know it. I know it. And pretty much the whole world knows it. \nThe establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are very well-known. \nAnyone who challenge their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe, and morally deformed. \nThey will attack you. They will slander. They will seek to destroy your career and your family. They will seek to destroy everything about you, including your reputation. \nThey will lie, lie, lie, and then again they will do worse than that. They will do whatever is necessary. \nThe Clintons are criminals. Remember that. They\u2019re criminals. \nThis is well-documented and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation in order to keep the Clintons in power. \nNever in history have we seen such a cover-up as this. \nOne that includes the total destruction of 33,000 emails, 13 iPhones, some by hammer, laptops, missing boxes of evidence, and many, many other things. \nPeople who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything. \nAnd so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the Clinton machine and the New York Times and other media outlets as part of a concerted, coordinated and vicious attack. \nIt\u2019s not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment and all together at the same time as Wikileaks releases documents exposing the massive international corruption of the Clinton machine, including 2,000 more emails just this morning. \nThese vicious claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false. And the Clintons know it and they know it very well. \nThe political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs as they flee to Mexico, China, and other countries all around the world. \nOur just announced job numbers are anemic. Our gross domestic product or GDP is barely above 1% and going down. \nWorkers in the United States are making less than they were almost 20 years ago and yet they are working harder. But so am I working harder. That I can tell you. \nIt\u2019s a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities. \nJust look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like Detroit, Flint, Michigan, and rural towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and all across our country. Take a look at what\u2019s going on. \nThey\u2019ve stripped these towns bare and raided the wealth for themselves and taken our jobs away out of our country, never to return unless I\u2019m elected president. \nThe Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure. We\u2019ve seen this first hand in the Wikileaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends, and her donors. \nSo true. \nHonestly, she should be locked up. Should be. Should be locked up. \nAnd likewise, the emails show that the Clinton machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to the media organizations that she \u2013 listen to this \u2013 is given the questions and answers in advance of her debate performance with Bernie Sanders. \nHillary Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times. They definitely do not do that to me. That I can tell you. \nAnd the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton campaign on helping her win the election all over. \nWith their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign. Not going to happen, which has now become a great, great movement, the likes of which our country has never seen before. Never ever. \nThey\u2019ve never seen a movement like this in our country before. \nYesterday in Florida, massive crowds. People lined up outside of big arenas, not able to get in. Never happened before. It\u2019s one of the great phenomenons, one of the great political phenomenons. \nThe most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media \u2013 the press. \nLet\u2019s be clear on one thing. The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. \nWow! What a group! What a group! \nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, folks. \nThank you, folks, it\u2019s great to be right here in Florida which we love. \nIn 26 days, we are going to win this great, great state and we are going to win the White House. \nOur movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt \u2013 and when I say corrupt, I\u2019m talking about totally corrupt \u2013 political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American people. \nThere is nothing the political establishment will not do, no lie that they won\u2019t tell to hold their prestige and power at your expense and that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening. \nThe Washington establishment and the financial and media corporations that fund it exist for only one reason \u2013 to protect and enrich itself. \nThe establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. \nAs an example, just one single trade deal they\u2019d like to pass involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries, corporations, and lobbyists. \nFor those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don\u2019t have your good in mind. \nOur campaign represents a true existential threat like they haven\u2019t seen before. \nThis is not simply another four year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we the people reclaim control over our government. \nThe political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry.

We\u2019re fighting ISIS. ISIS wants to fight Syria. Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria? Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants. \nI would talk to him. I would get along with him. \nI believe \u2013 and I maybe wrong in which case I\u2019d probably have to take a different path \u2013 but I would get along with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with. \nWe don\u2019t get along with China. We don\u2019t get along with the heads of Mexico. \nWe don\u2019t get along with anybody and yet at the same time they rip us left and right. They take advantage of us economically and in every other way. \nWe get along with nobody. I would get along I think with Putin and I would get along with others.

And I just can\u2019t wait. \nSo, we don\u2019t have much of a race anymore based on what I\u2019m seeing on television. \nSen. Cruz is just about mathematically eliminated. \nAnd we\u2019ve won another state. As you know, we have won millions of more votes than Sen. Cruz. Millions and millions of more votes than Gov. Kasich. We\u2019ve won and now especially after tonight close to 300 delegates more than Sen. Cruz. We\u2019re really, really rocking. \nWe expect we\u2019re going to have an amazing number of weeks because these are places and they\u2019re in trouble. They\u2019re in big trouble. \nWhen you look at Pennsylvania. When you look at Indiana. When you look at Maryland and Rhode Island and so many places, we have problems everywhere you look. We are going to solve those problems. \nAnd one of the big problems is the economy and jobs, and that is my wheelhouse. \nSo again, I want to thank everybody. It\u2019s really nice to win the delegates with the votes. You know? It\u2019s really nice. \nNobody should be given delegates, which is a ticket to victory and it\u2019s not a fair ticket. \nAnd even though we\u2019re leading by a lot and we can\u2019t be caught \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to catch us \u2013 nobody should take delegates and claim victory unless they get those delegates with voters and voting. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. \nAnd you watch. Because the people aren\u2019t going to stand for it. It\u2019s a crooked system. It\u2019s a system that\u2019s rigged. And we\u2019re going to go back to the old ways called you vote and you win. \nSo we\u2019ll be going to the convention no matter what happens and I think we\u2019re going to go in so strong. \nAnd over the next number of weeks, we just saw a poll come out of California, which is an unbelievable poll. \nBut we\u2019re going to go into the convention, I think, as the winner. \nBut nobody can take an election away with the way they\u2019re doing it in the Republican Party. \nAnd by the way, I am no fan of Bernie. But I\u2019ve seen Bernie win, win, win, and then I watch and they say he has no chance of winning. So they have their super delegates. \nThe Republican system is worse. So I want to just thank everybody. I have great, great admiration and praise for the city of New York and the state of New York. I can think of nowhere that I would rather have this victory. \nSo we love you all. Have a great evening. We celebrate. \nAnd tomorrow morning, we go back to work. I\u2019m flying tomorrow morning. I\u2019m flying tomorrow morning to Indiana. I\u2019m going to Pennsylvania. I will be all over. So we\u2019re going to celebrate for about two hours. Then early in the morning I get up and we begin working again. \nThank you everybody! And thank you New York! We love New York! We love New York! Thank you very much! \nVery importantly and behind me I have to say we have some of our great businessmen of the world. Carl Icahn is here some place. Where\u2019s Carl? \n...But we have our great leaders and it been really something. It has been really something amazing. \nAnd believe me, we are going to use our great business people to negotiate unbelievable trade deals so we bring our jobs back and we don\u2019t let our companies go to Mexico and all of these other countries anymore. We\u2019re going to keep the jobs here. \nYou\u2019re going to be very proud of this country very soon. \nWe\u2019re going to build our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before. \nNobody is going to mess with us. That I can tell you. \nWe\u2019re going to take care of our vets. Our vets are our great people and we have forgotten our vets. Illegal immigrants are taken care of in many cases better than our vets. That\u2019s not going to happen anymore. That is not going to happen. \nWe\u2019re getting rid of Obamacare. It\u2019s going to be repealed and replaced. It is a total disaster with premiums going up 35%, 55%. It\u2019s going to probably end of its own volition. We\u2019re getting rid of it. \nWe\u2019re bringing Common Core \u2013 we\u2019re knocking it out. We\u2019re cutting it. It\u2019s going to be over. And we\u2019re bringing education locally \u2013 local communities are going to take care of their educational needs and people have been waiting for that for a long time. \nSo with all of the things that have happened, today, tonight, and over the week, I\u2019ll tell you what, this has been an amazing week. \nAll over New York state \u2013 we went to Syracuse, we went to Albany \u2013 20,000 people. You know, on average, we\u2019d have 15,000 to 20,000 people. We went to Rochester. We went to Bethpage. We went all over. \nAnd you know what? The people of this country and the people of this state truly are great and amazing people. We are going to be so strong again.   \n...The people that know me the best, the people of New York where they give us this kind of a vote. And it\u2019s just incredible and I guess we\u2019re close to 70% and we\u2019re going to end at a very high level and get a lot more delegates than anybody projected even in their wildest imaginations. \nSo I just want to thank everybody here. I want to thank my family. \nI want to thank \u2013 I really want to thank my team. My team has been amazing. And you know, it\u2019s actually a team of unity. It\u2019s evolving but people don\u2019t understand that. The press does understand it. They just don\u2019t want to talk about it. That\u2019s okay. Just keep talking. It\u2019s very important. Keep talking. \nBut this has been an incredible evening. It\u2019s been an incredible day and week. \nWe went all over New York state. New York state has problems like virtually every other state in the union. \nOur jobs are being sucked out of our state. They\u2019re being taken out of our country and we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore. We\u2019re going to stop it. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s speech at the Republican National Convention", "text": "A president who\u2019s actually created real jobs, who has actually signed the front of a paycheck and who doesn\u2019t just talk about it in theory. \nA president who has real people\u2019s families and livelihoods depending on his success and the success of his company for decades. \nA president who speaks his mind and not just when it behooves him to do so, who doesn\u2019t have to run a focus group or use data analytics to be able to form a simple opinion, who says what needs to be said and not just what you want to hear. \nA president who will unleash the greatness in our nation and in all of us, who will give the hard working men and women who built this great country a voice once again. \nThat president can only be my mentor, my best friend, my father, Donald Trump. \nAnd when we elect him, we\u2019ll have done all that. We\u2019ll have made America great again- greater than ever before. \nThank you and God bless! \nMark was one of the men who received frantic phone calls from his buddies at the compound. Calls that pleaded for help. Calls that he and his team tried to answer. But calls that didn\u2019t save all his friends because Secretary Clinton\u2019s State Department had ignored their request for help, both on the night in question and even in the weeks and months leading up to the attack. \nIt was a tragedy and one that would be repeated were she to win the election. \nAsk Mark, who\u2019s fit to lead? Who has the judgment to lead? Who will take that call at three o\u2019clock in the morning? Or better yet, ask yourselves if you were in Mark\u2019s shoes that night, who would you rather call? \nLet me tell you something about risk, if Hillary Clinton were elected, she\u2019d be the first president who couldn\u2019t pass a basic background check. It\u2019s incredible. \nHillary Clinton is a risk Americans can\u2019t afford to take. \nShe says she\u2019ll issue executive orders to take away Americans\u2019 guns. She wants to appoint judges who will abolish the Second Amendment. \nJust look at how effective those laws have been in inner city Chicago. A city with the toughest gun laws in our nation, where 70 people were murdered last month alone and where over 3,400 American lives have been lost since this administration took office in 2009. \nYou know why those laws fail? Because criminals by definition don\u2019t follow laws. \nRather than prosecuting real criminals, she would strip hard working, law abiding citizens of their rights to protect themselves and their families. \nShe\u2019ll throw every possible obstacle in the path of safe, reliable, affordable, energy, produced in America, by Americans for American businesses and families. \nRather than being energy independent, our country will be forced to remain beholden to her buddies in the Middle East. \nThose are risks we can\u2019t afford to take. And when we win, we\u2019re not going to have to. \nThere\u2019s so much work to do. \nWe will not accept the current state of our country because it\u2019s too hard to change. That\u2019s not the America I know. \nWe\u2019re going to unleash the creative spirit and energy of all Americans. \nWe\u2019re going to make our schools the best in the world for every single American of every single ethnicity and background. \nWe\u2019re going to put Americans first. All Americans. Not a special class of crony elites at the top of the heap. \nWe\u2019re going to elect a president who will work with everyone to pass legislation that will make our country great again. \nA president who will give us a tax code that will free the American economy and end special loopholes for the wealthy. \nA president who will give us an immigration law that protects American citizens and gives them jobs. \nA president who will repeal and replace Obamacare without leaving our most vulnerable citizens without health care and who will do it without destroying Medicare for seniors as Hillary Clinton has proposed. \nA president who knows we can\u2019t simply delete our problems but that we have to tackle them head on. \nA president who won\u2019t allow PC culture to put the safety and well-being of our children and our loved ones at stake. \nA president who won\u2019t bow and pander to nations that shudder at the very thought of America\u2019s existence. \nA president more concerned with the safety and comfort of his fellow Americans than the feelings of those hostile nations abroad, who if given the option would wipe America off the face of this Earth! \nA president not beholden to special interests, foreign and domestic, and one who funded his entire primary run out of his own pocket just to prove it. \nA president who will secure and defend the borders of the United States and will appoint judges who believe that freedom requires a limited government. \nA president who won\u2019t use the highest office in the land as a path to personal enrichment. \nPingback: #RCNinCle: Make America First Again And Other Brilliant King Tut Wholesale Lifts \u0097 Hillary Is 44 \nI know he values those workers and those qualities in people, because those are the individuals he had my sibling and me work under when we started out. \nThat he would trust his own children\u2019s formative years to these men and women says all you need to know about Donald Trump. \nWe didn\u2019t learn from MBAs. We learned from people who had doctorates in common sense. Guys like Vinny Stellio [sp], who taught us how to drive heavy equipment, operate tractors and chainsaws, who worked his way through the ranks to become a trusted adviser of my father. \nIt\u2019s why we\u2019re the only children of billionaires as comfortable in a D10 Caterpillar as we are in our own cars. \nMy father knew that those were the guys and gals that would teach us the dignity of hard work from a very young age. \nHe knows that at the heart of the American dream is the idea that whoever we are, wherever we\u2019re from, we can get ahead, where everyone can prosper together. \nThe other party also tells us they believe in the American dream. They say we should worry about economic inequality and immobility. \nYou know what? They\u2019re right. But they don\u2019t tell you that it was their policies that caused the problem and it was their policies that have no accountability. \nThey gave us the worst immigration system in the world, one that imports immobility, one that drives down employment and wages for Hispanic Americans, for African Americans, and for everyone. An immigration system that favors illegals over those trying to go through the process legally and, at times, even over law-abiding citizens. \nIt was Bernie Sanders himself who warned that a large tide of new workers keeps wages low and poverty high. \nThe other party gave us public schools that far too often fail our students, especially those who have no options. \nGrowing up, my siblings and I, we were truly fortunate to have choices and options that others don\u2019t have. We want all Americans to have those same opportunities. \nOur schools used to be an elevator to the middle class, now they\u2019re stalled on the ground floor. They\u2019re like Soviet-era department stores that are run for the benefit of the clerks, and not the customers, for the teachers and the administrators and not the students. \nYou know why other countries do better on K through 12? They let parents choose where to send their own children to school. \nThat\u2019s called competition. It\u2019s called the free market. \nAnd it\u2019s what the other party fears. They fear it because they\u2019re more concerned about protecting the jobs of tenured teachers than serving the students in desperate need of a good education. \nThey want to run everything top-down from Washington. They tell us they\u2019re the experts and they know what\u2019s best. \nThe other party gave us a regulatory state on steroids. \nDodd-Frank was a thousand pages long and it\u2019s already spun off 22,000 pages in regulations. \nImagine trying to digest all that before you even open your doors for business. That doesn\u2019t help consumers. What it does is destroy small business in favor of big businesses who can afford the vast number of lawyers and accountants needed to comply. Dodd-Frank is consumer protection for billionaires. \nWe\u2019ve produced the thickest network of patronage and influence of any country at any time in world history. It\u2019s composed of a self-satisfied people at the top \u2013 our new aristocrats. We can\u2019t live that way any longer, it\u2019s too risky. \nLet me talk a little bit about risks. \nThe other party is the party of risk. \nI\u2019ve spent many time with many great Americans who have served this country in the military, and they know what\u2019s at stake. When we have weak leaders in positions of power, Americans risking their lives for our freedoms are less safe. \nYou know, almost daily I get a call or a text from a real American hero. His name is Mark Geist and I\u2019m proud to call him a friend. \nMark was part of the security team at the annex on our grounds at the consulate in Benghazi. \nI\u2019m a father of five young children, from two-year-old Chloe to Kai who just turned nine. I\u2019m the husband to Vanessa, an amazing wife and mother. And a son of a great man. \nI\u2019m an American. And tonight I want to talk to you about the country we live in. The country our children will grow up in. \nFor my generation, this is the most important election of our lifetime \u2013 one that will determine the future of our country and in turn the future of the world. \nFor too long our country has ignored its problems, punting them down the road for its future generations to deal with. \nIn business, I was trained by my father to make the tough investments and decisions today to ensure a brighter future tomorrow. \nWe\u2019ve actually started to believe that solving our great problems is an impossible task. And that\u2019s why we need to elect a man who has a track record of accomplishing the impossible. \nFor the first time, parents no longer think that their kids will be as well off as we were. We\u2019ve lost the confidence in our leaders and the faith in our institutions. \nWe\u2019ll remember one thing. We\u2019re still Americans. We\u2019re still one country, and we\u2019re going to get it all back. We\u2019re going to get it back better than ever before. \nI know we\u2019ll get it back because I know my father. I know that when people tell him it can\u2019t be done, that guarantees that he gets it done. \nI know that when someone tells him that something is impossible, that\u2019s what triggers him into action. \nWhen people told him that it was impossible for a boy from Queens to go to Manhattan and take on developers in the big city, rather than give up, he changed the skyline of New York. \nI\u2019ve seen it time and time again. That look in his eyes when someone says it can\u2019t be done. \nI saw that look a little over a year ago when he was told he couldn\u2019t possibly succeed in politics. Yes, he did. \nFor my father, impossible is just the starting point. That\u2019s how he approaches business projects. That\u2019s how he approaches life. \nWhether it\u2019s teaching his granddaughter how to swing a golf club or tackling the toughest negotiations, he\u2019s always fully committed. \nThat\u2019s why the person who had never run for office before, stood on the stage 11 months ago, in this very arena, with 16 professional politicians, and this week that same man will stand before you as our party\u2019s nominee for the president of the United States of America! \nAs a proud son and family member, it was one of the great honors of my life to be able to put him over the top in the delegate count earlier today. \nHis unrelenting determination is why he\u2019s going to become our next president. And why I know that when my father says he can fix the country, he means it. \nYou want to know what kind of president he\u2019ll be? \nLet me tell you how he ran his businesses, and I know because I was there with him, by his side on job sites, in conference rooms from the time I could walk. \nHe didn\u2019t hide out behind some desk in an executive suite. He spent his career with regular Americans. He hung out with the guys on construction sites, pouring sheet rock and pouring concrete and hanging sheet rock. He listened to them and he valued their opinions as much and often more than the guys from Harvard and Wharton locked away in offices, away from the real work. \nHe\u2019s recognized the talent and the drive that all Americans have. \nHe\u2019s promoted people based on their character, their street smarts, and their work ethic, not simply paper credentials. \nTo this day, many of the top executives in our company are individuals that started out in positions that were blue collar. But he saw something in them and he pushed them to succeed. \nThe true gift as a leader is that he sees the potential in people that they don\u2019t even see in themselves \u2013 the potential that other executives would overlook because their resumes don\u2019t include the names of fancy colleges and degrees.

They have the money. And they\u2019re making a fortune. Mexico is doing very well. \nThey have the money. They will pay for the wall. \nThey\u2019re sending drugs and they\u2019re taking money out. They\u2019re making a lot of money. Mexico\u2019s making a lot of money. \nAnd I\u2019m a big fan of Mexico. I\u2019m a huge fan of the Mexican people. I have thousands of Mexican people working for me right now and have over the years. But they have to pay for the wall. \nAnd we need the wall. \nDo you know that 10 years ago Hillary and everybody wanted a wall? And then they said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s too expensive.\u201d You know one of the reasons? Environmental impact... \nI\u2019m the best builder in the country. \nYou have to get rid of [birthright citizenship]. Yes, you have to. What they\u2019re doing \u2013 they\u2019re having a baby and all of a sudden, nobody knows \u2013 \nYou have no choice. You have no choice. Let me tell you, when we have some good people \u2013 we have some really good people here. We have a lot of really good people. They\u2019re illegal. \nYou either have a country or not. And we\u2019re going to try and bring them back rapidly, the good ones, rapidly. \nYou know the word expedited? Expedited. \nThe executive order [DACA] gets rescinded. You\u2019re going to have to. \nWe have to make a whole new set of standards and when people come in they have to come in legally. \nNo, we\u2019re going to keep the families together. We have to keep the together but they have to go. They have to go...We will work with them. They have to go. \nWe either have a country or we don\u2019t have a country. Either we have a country or not. \nLook at the cost of what we have right now...Do you think there\u2019s tremendous cost for the illegals that are in here right now? Okay. Tremendous. \nDo you think there\u2019s tremendous crime being committed by illegals? Tremendous. Far greater than \u2013 and you see it all over just last night. All over. \nAnd we will do it and we will expedite it so people can come back in. The good people can come back in. \nYeah, but you have incompetent politicians. You have bad managers. They\u2019re all talk; they\u2019re no actions...They\u2019re incompetent. \nYou can run [government] like a business with heart. What people don\u2019t know about me \u2013 I have a lot of heart. \nIt will work out so well. You will be so happy. In four years, you\u2019re going to be interviewing me and you\u2019re going to say \u201cWhat a great job you\u2019ve done, President Trump.\u201d \nYou\u2019re going to say, \u201cYou have done one of the great jobs.\u201d It\u2019s going to happen. \nAnd you know what? The good are going to be able to come back but they\u2019re going to come back legally. \nWe have to have a country. We have to have a great country. \nAlso, I want to bring people that are going to really help us not all at the low end...And I\u2019ve been hearing more and more of this \u2013 we have to bring people that are university \u2013 you know, go to universities, that are doctors. We need a lot of people like that. \nBut we\u2019re spending a lot of money right now by keeping all of this crime. \nYou have the Department of Education. You have so much money being spent. I\u2019m going to have it pared down to very little because I\u2019m not a Common Core \u2013 Jeb Bush wants Common Core. It\u2019s a disaster. \nEPA \u2013 look at them. Look at the river. What happened. EPA. I wonder if somebody\u2019s going to sue them now. \nYou know, they\u2019re fining everybody all the time they\u2019re fining. \nWe need less government, and we will save a fortune. \nAs far as immigration\u2019s concerned, we need the wall. We want people to come in. I want to come in. They have to be wonderful people; they have to come in legally. \nYou know, if you\u2019re in Mexico, it\u2019s almost impossible to become a citizen of Mexico? And with us, they just walk across the border. \nOkay, they want to come here. But a lot of them come here, take the money, and go back into Mexico and the other countries because they still want to stay at their own country. \nYou would be amazed. They want to stay in their own country. They have a loyalty to their own country. \nThey come here. They take our money, then they go back. \nI\u2019m not saying they it illegally \u2013 in many cases they don\u2019t. In some cases we have problems. \nBut they come into this country, they take the money, they go back home into one of many countries. I don\u2019t like that. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s press conference on his new book \u201cCrippled America\u201d", "text": "Question:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI think Marco is highly overrated. Highly overrated. He doesn\u2019t have it and all you have to do is look at his stance on things. \nJeb \u2013 he lacks the quality that you need. \nWe\u2019re talking about everybody in the world is ripping us off. You need a very strong person with tremendous energy. Thank you very much folks, I\u2019ll take the job. \nBut and it\u2019s so important. And by the way, Ben Carson does not have that energy. \nWe need somebody with tremendous energy to straighten out the military, to straighten out ISIS, to straighten out our horrible trade deals, to terminate Obamacare and come up with something far better for far less money. You need somebody with tremendous personal energy as President. \nWe have a president right now that doesn\u2019t have energy. I mean, you think Obama has energy? He has no energy. And he\u2019s been a horrible president. \nWe need somebody with great personal energy as a leader so that we can make great deals with other countries and do well in every other respect. And certainly Jeb does not have that energy in my opinion. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd by the way, I was right, they were wrong. The 14th Amendment does not give them clearance on that. \nAnd if you wanted to do that in Mexico or if you wanted to do that in almost any other country where you have a baby in that country and that country has that person for 85 years including all of the costs of that person, they would laugh you right out of the country. You would be laughed out of the country so fast. \nSo, that turned out \u2013 I was 100% right. We\u2019ll have to worry about that. We\u2019re going to take care of it, and it\u2019s going to be done in a very humane way. \nBut we\u2019re going to bring back our country and we\u2019re going to have a wall and Mexico\u2019s going to pay for the wall and you know why they\u2019re going to pay? And I have great relationships with Mexico and phenomenal relationships with the Mexican people. Phenomenal. And they buy apartments from me; they work for me by the thousands \u2013 by the thousands. Phenomenal relationships. \nBut let me just tell you we lose so much money with Mexico in terms of trade imbalance \u2013 $45 billion last year. Plus, we give Mexico billions and billions of dollars. They will pay for the wall. And it will be very interesting. \nAnd you know what? People are going to come into this country but they\u2019re going to come in legally. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI\u2019m going to make America great again. Nobody else is going to be able to do that. I\u2019m going to do it. \nI\u2019m going to make it in my opinion better than ever before, and I think that\u2019s awfully tough to compete with. \nAnd one of the reasons that in my book I actually put financials in there \u2013 I showed some of the developments that \u2013 I have many, many more because you can only \u2013 Simon and Schuster \u2013 you actually kept me to eight or nine pages. Right? And there are four or five in a page. But I show some of the great developments that I have done that are so successful and so incredible and so financially good, I show my financial statement from a year and a half, two years ago. Now it\u2019s even better but we didn\u2019t have that certified yet. \nSo I do that not in a braggadocious way. I do that because that\u2019s the kind of thinking our country needs right now. \nWe are run by people that are incompetent. We are run by people who in so many words \u2013 I hate to use the word stupid but you have to use that word. Unless they have bad intentions which I don\u2019t believe they do. But we are run by incompetent people. We have incompetent leadership. \nThere are so many things. Like I mentioned corporate inversion. The Democrats want the money to come back. Who doesn\u2019t? The Republicans want the money to come back. For three years, the Democrats have said we want the money to come back. For three years, the Democrats and the Republicans agree 100%. You have a vast majority. Maybe everybody. For three years. Guess what? They haven\u2019t done anything. Right? They can\u2019t even get along when they agree. \nSo here\u2019s the thing where we can take trillions of dollars, bring it back to this country, rebuild big parts of our country with it, companies can spend that money in our country, we have everybody agrees it should be done for years and they can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s a part of the problem. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nYou see, they were asking \u2013 they were giving statements in a sarcastic, disgusting way. \nAnd by the way, I think Becky is terrific and I think Carl is terrific. But I think John Harwood is not very good at what he does. But I think Becky Quick is a terrific person. I think Carl is a terrific person. But I will tell you John Harwood was a disgrace to CNBC. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd one of the problems that we have is our currency right now is not competitive with other currencies. Because if you look at the devaluations of China, of Japan, of many, many different countries, they\u2019re making it impossible for our companies to compete with them because we don\u2019t have leaders that know how to say to China, \u201cDon\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t do that. Because if you do that, we\u2019re going to put a big fat tax on you. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d And you know what? If you said that, they wouldn\u2019t do it. If you have the right messenger... \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nBut the election that I\u2019m watching is the election for the presidency of the United States. That is going to be in my opinion this will be truly one of the most important elections we\u2019ve ever had in this country. We\u2019re so far behind. And we cannot go another four years with incompetent leadership. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWhat happened is they sent this incredible photographer up to do a book cover, do to a picture. And he did some great...photos. I\u2019m smiling. I\u2019m happy. I look good. Everything was fine. And then he took one where I wasn\u2019t like really thinking about a photo and then it turned out to be a nasty picture. And then the book was written and the title was given and the only really terrible picture I had was that one. It\u2019s a terrible, horrible, nasty picture. But when you\u2019re talking about \u201cCrippled America\u201d and you\u2019re talking about all of the problems we have, I can\u2019t have a big smiley face up there. So that\u2019s how we picked it. We picked the worst photo taken of me. \nI would have loved to have a beautiful smiling picture but somehow that doesn\u2019t go with the title of the book or frankly the content of the book, and actually Simon and Schuster agreed with me. Okay? \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nThank you very much everybody. Thank you. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nNow, maybe we won\u2019t. But I believe we will have a very good relationship with Russia. I believe that I will have a very good relationship with Putin. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nBut we didn\u2019t talk about corporate inversions where companies are leaving our country \u2013 massive companies \u2013 because they can\u2019t get their money back and because they get lower taxes elsewhere. So they\u2019re leaving and they\u2019re taking their jobs with them. \nThe corporate inversion syndrome is a very important thing to be talking about. \nThese were all things that weren\u2019t talked about at the debate. Instead, they talked about fantasy football. I mean, it was a big question \u2013 fantasy football. I\u2019m saying what about corporate inversions? $2.5 trillion at least. I think it\u2019s probably twice that number is in other countries wanting to come back and because our system is so corrupt and terrible, they can\u2019t get the money back to invest in this country. \nSo they don\u2019t talk about corporate inversions at the debates. They talk about fantasy football. Those are the few. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWell, you know, you have to understand, I was a developer. A lot of people didn\u2019t care about my view in 2003 and 2004. But there was a Reuters article taken from a magazine about my stance in 2004, I believe, in July of 2004 and it talked about my stance on how I felt about Iraq. And I said very strongly exactly what happened. I said you will destabilize the Middle East and when you destabilize the Middle East, Iran will take over Iraq. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. And they will take over the oil reserves, which are among the largest in the world, and in addition other bad things will happen. The other bad things are ISIS. I said that in 2004 and that was an article that was taken from a magazine which was previous to that. I\u2019ve felt that for a long time. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nLook, if a person is campaigning for four or five months and they\u2019re at 0% or 1% or 2%, they should get out. \nLike, you know, look at me. I go to Florida and look at the numbers that just came out in Florida. 37%? Georgia. I mean, those are real numbers. These numbers that these people have \u2013 and I often ask myself. I asked Mark yesterday, \u201cWhat are they doing? Do they do this for their brand? Because I happen to think it\u2019s very bad for their brand.\u201d \nI think [Scott] Walker did a good thing. I think the way Walker \u2013 he saw it wasn\u2019t happening, wasn\u2019t going to happen and he just got out quickly. You know, he was favored. Don\u2019t forget. You know. That was before Trump was going to happen. Right? But he was favored for a period of time. Favored. Walker. Gov. Walker. They thought he was going to win. \nWhat happened is he got out. \nI think the way he got out was great. I think he did a really smart thing for himself. \nAnd frankly, other people should get out because I would like to personally have more time to talk about the problems of the United States and more importantly how we can solve the problems. So it\u2019s a great question. People should get out. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWell, walls work. All you have to do is ask Israel. Walls work if it\u2019s properly constructed. Not the walls that these characters, these politicians that we have running our country who are a disgrace \u2013 all talk, no action politicians \u2013 they build a wall this big, they drive cars right through it. \nWalls work. All you have to do is go and see Israel. They will tell you that walls work. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWe have no victories. And I do write about it. We need some pomp and circumstance. We need spirit. We need a cheerleader. \nI thought seven years ago when Obama got elected, the one thing I thought that he would be a great cheerleader for this country. He\u2019s not. He\u2019s been a great divider for the country. He\u2019s been one of the great dividers of all time. \nI\u2019m not saying dress. It has nothing to do with dress. It has to do with the fact that what he says is very divisive. He has been a great divider for this country, and that should not have happened. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nSo I like the debates. I think they\u2019re good for me. But we have to be treated a little bit fairly. \nAs an example, Hillary Clinton \u2013 no tough questions. I mean, why didn\u2019t they ask about Bill? Why didn\u2019t they ask about all of the different things. No tough questions. Now, that was staged by the Democrats. And frankly, they did a very smart thing in the way they staged it. \nWell, we\u2019re going to stage something properly also. \nBut as far as I\u2019m concerned, I really don\u2019t care that much. I just want a debate. I think debating is a good thing. It\u2019s healthy. Gets everything into the open. \nBut you don\u2019t want people like Harwood that read a question \u2013 blah, blah, blah \u2013 that he wrote \u2013 that he carefully wrote. He thought he was such \u2013 his career \u2013 in my opinion, his career is probably ruined or certainly threatened. \nHe could ask about anything you want. I mean, you have to ask about anything you want. Hillary had only softballs. All night long. It was like this \u2013 \u201cHere, Hillary, hit this one out of the park.\u201d \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd I have a great relationship, as you know from Telemundo, with the Hispanics. You\u2019ve treated me actually very fairly. Won the poll recently in Nevada. Won other polls. And in Nevada, I think I got 37% and leading everybody. \nSo I have a great relationship with the Hispanics. I have working for me thousands right now \u2013 thousands of Hispanics. I\u2019ve had tens of thousands of people over the year working for me. I\u2019m a job machine. I\u2019m a job machine. \nAnd one of the things that does come out in every single poll and every single survey is that nobody for the economy nobody is even close. I\u2019m two, three, and you see that \u2013 two, three, four, five times greater than anybody else. \nAnd you\u2019d almost say like it\u2019s about the jobs, it\u2019s about the economy. Then how\u2019s anybody going to beat Trump in all fairness? \nBut I\u2019ve had a great relationship with the workers. I\u2019ve had a great relationship with jobs. And I\u2019ve had an amazing relationship with the Hispanics. And I predict that I\u2019m going to win the Hispanic vote. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nBut a lot of the people that are candidates who I respect \u2013 many of them, not all of them \u2013 but I respect many of them, they felt it was very unfair because Hillary Clinton was given all soft balls. I mean, she wasn\u2019t asked one tough question. They didn\u2019t talk about her foundation. They didn\u2019t talk about any of the problems. They didn\u2019t talk about the emails. When the email problem came up, Bernie Sanders lost his whole campaign. I mean, what he did was so stupid from his standpoint. In order to get a one-minute soundbite of some applause, he gave up the emails. That was end of his campaign. \nFirst of all, people aren\u2019t going to his rallies anymore. He\u2019s finished. \nSo unless something happens to her with respect to the emails, she\u2019ll easily be the candidate. \nBut I will say this: She only got softballs. That\u2019s all she got. \nAnd if you look at the way we were treated, it wasn\u2019t the same way. \nWith that being said, I don\u2019t really care. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd the Republicans coalesced around each other. It was actually pretty beautiful when you think about it. \nAnd all we want to do is to be treated fairly. \nBut with me, I don\u2019t care that much. Just give me a podium. \nWhat I would say is this: The networks have made a fortune because of me, not because of anybody else. \nYou know, they were saying that the last cycle, they had 2 million and 1 million people and the networks didn\u2019t even want to broadcast it because nobody watched. Okay? Nobody wanted to watch. \nNow, they have 25 million people, 24 million people, 23 million people and 16 million people. I mean, give me a break. \nSo somebody said, \u201cHow did they get there?\u201d \nAnd actually Variety and Hollywood Reporter, who do report this stuff pretty well \u2013 much better than the political press \u2013 they said \u201csolely for one reason \u2013 it was Trump\u201d. I\u2019ll take the credit. \nBut I\u2019ll tell you what I also want. I think that Wounded Warriors and our veterans should be given some of the enormous profits being made on these debates \u2013 enormous profits \u2013 by the way beyond anything they\u2019ve ever envisioned. \nCNN was going to get $2,000 for a 30 second ad. They ended up getting $250,000. So they went from $2,000 to $250,000 for a 30 second ad. \nThe networks and the cable are making a fortune, and I think they should give some of the profits to the Wounded Warriors and the veterans. That\u2019s what I want. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI have many, many executives upstairs and in different buildings that I have that are women. Many \u2013 a proportion that\u2019s close to 50%. Might even be over 50% if I analyze it. And they get paid a lot of money \u2013 in many cases more than men doing the same job. \nSo women have always appreciated that about me. I\u2019ve been in terms of employment really a standout and I\u2019ve been honored for doing so well with women. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \n...Because the country is doing so poorly. It\u2019s a very accurate title because the country is doing so poorly. \nBut we see by the lines \u2013 the lines go down to Park Avenue. They\u2019ve been forming since last night and I\u2019m going to be signing books starting at 12 p.m. We\u2019re doing a couple of interviews and then we\u2019re signing books starting at 12 p.m. and that\u2019ll be very exciting for me. \nBut we have fans that have bought the book and they just bought it and some have been online now for 12 and 14 hours. I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re doing this but they do it. They find a way. \nSo I\u2019m looking forward to getting to the signings. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nA poll just came out in Florida where I\u2019m leading big. Georgia, Texas. I mean, all over the place. \nAnd I think you know look we\u2019re doing well. And if you add Ben and myself we\u2019re beating everybody by a lot. That seems to be the big story that we\u2019re beating \u2013 they call it the establishment. It\u2019s called really the failed establishment because the establishment has let us down. \nBut I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how his book is doing. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nLook, nobody can negotiate trade deals like me. \nWe are going to take the $400 billion a year that we\u2019re losing with China, that\u2019s going to be turned around. The $75 billion a year that we\u2019re short on with Japan. \nThe $50 billion a year that we lost to Mexico. And that\u2019s right, there will be a wall built. It will go up. It will be built. And people will come into the country legally. \nSo I mean, much different than \u2013 you\u2019re look at Marco Rubio \u2013 very, very weak on illegal immigration. \nYou look at Ben and he\u2019s very weak on immigration and he wants to get rid of Medicare. I mean, Ben wants to get rid of Medicare. You can\u2019t get rid of Medicare. It\u2019d be a horrible thing to get rid of. It actually works. You get rid of the fraud, waste, and abuse. It works. So when a man is weak on immigration and wants to get rid of Medicare, I don\u2019t know how he stays here. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nBut Marco is a sitting Senator and he doesn\u2019t show up for the people of Florida, and I don\u2019t think he should be doing that. \nNow, Bush gave a very weak message. I agree with that. It was poorly delivered. But the facts are on Bush\u2019s side and ultimately I think Marco\u2019s going to be hurt very badly. \nAnd if you look at Mr. Singer, you have to see where Mr. Singer is coming from and when you see where he\u2019s coming from, I think people are going to say, \u201cWhoa, we didn\u2019t know that.\u201d \nBut look at Marco\u2019s stance on illegal immigration. It\u2019s really trouble for him. I don\u2019t see how he can win. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nBut his credit card debt and his problems with credit card and what he did when he was running the party apparatus with credit cards, I\u2019ve heard about it for years. You\u2019ll have to find out. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \n...It\u2019s a great honor. I want to thank Simon and Schuster, one of the most magnificent publishers. For years and years, I\u2019ve heard about Simon and Schuster\u2019s being a fabulous \u2013 I was going to say the Rolls-Royce, I was going to say the Harvard or the Yale, but they really are a great one. And I want to thank you very much. You\u2019ve given us such tremendous support. \nAnd we did this quickly and I think we did it very effectively. It\u2019s been an incredible experience. \nWe wrote a book and the title \u2013 \u201cCrippled America\u201d \u2013 is very tough but unfortunately we have to do what we have to do and I think one of the reasons we\u2019ve been doing so well in the campaign is because we tell it like it is. We tell the truth. \nAnd America is crippled. We owe $17 [trillion] and now $18 [trillion] and now it\u2019s actually very soon going to be $19 trillion in debt. \nWe have a military that doesn\u2019t have proper instruction from leadership. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re losing all over the world with trade deals. Every country, no matter what country you talk about, you can just pick a name out of a hat, they\u2019re beating us in trade. \nAnd we can\u2019t go on like this any longer. It\u2019s impossible to go on like this any longer. \nI always mention as an example Sergeant Bergdahl, a traitor. We get Sergeant Bergdahl; they get five of the people they wanted and they wanted badly. And that\u2019s not the way it\u2019s going to work anymore. \nSo we write about it in the book. We tell lots of different stories of lots of different things. And I think it\u2019s going to be very instructional, very important. \nTo me, it was instructional. \nWhen I did \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d, I think one of the reasons it was so successful is that it was largely instructional. Even today when I speak, so many people hold up the book \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d and the other books we\u2019ve done. \nSo this is one that probably not since the Art of the Deal, I have to tell this to Louise and Simon and Schuster, have I worked so hard on a book and it was in a confined period of time. We wanted to get it out really, really quickly so that it pertain to what\u2019s going on right now. It\u2019s a moment of time. And we got it done. \nAnd David did a fantastic job...And all of my people did a great job. They helped me so much because we are doing a couple of other things right now. So this was not easy getting this in. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Baltimore", "text": "Instead of endless wars, we want a real plan for victory. \nWe will abandon the policy of reckless regime change favored by my opponent, and we will instead work with our allies to advance the core national security interests of the United States. America first, remember that. America first. \nMy plan calls for a major rebuilding of the entire military and the elimination of the defense \u2013 that we have to do this so quickly. It\u2019s a disaster of the defense sequester. It is a disaster. \nHave no choice. It is a disaster. It\u2019s called depletion. We have been depleted as a military. We can\u2019t let that happen. The greatest men and women one earth, but we have been depleted by what\u2019s taken place. \nIn this rebuilding, we will provide our National Guard with the best modern state-of-the-art equipment in the world. Bar none. \nThe National Guard is often the first and the last line of defense for our people. \nYou\u2019re there when the hurricanes and floods and tornados strike. Always amazes me. The courage, the care, the love that you give. Amazing. And the danger is beyond belief. \nYou\u2019re there to protect civilians in times of unrest. You\u2019re there to respond to every natural disaster. \nYou deserve a government that recognizes and honors your contribution and that ensures you have the resources you need to get the job done and to get the job done right. \nIn a Trump administration, the National Guard will always have a direct line to the Oval Office and I mean direct. \nYou will have an administration that never loses sight of the vital contribution you make each and every day. \nYou will have a president who supports, promotes, and speaks up for the National Guard at every single turn. \nThe incredible members of the National Guard have sacrificed life and limb for our freedom, our safety, and our country. \nWe will never forget our heroes, their families and the ones they\u2019ve left behind. Our gratitude is and will be everlasting. \nWe will protect those who protect us and we will follow your example of unity working in common purpose and for a common cause. \nWe will be one people under one God saluting one American flag. \nWe will rebuild our military and our country. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we together will make America great again. \nThank you very much everybody. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everybody.  \nIt\u2019s gonna be more of the same, only worse. It is going to be four more years of Barak Obama, only worse. \nShe just took it to a whole new level by applying it to tens of millions of people. She used these vile words in order to bully and intimidate honest citizens out of seeking government reform and there will be reform. There has to be reform. \nPeople who want their immigration laws enforced and we have no choice. We have to do it. And their border secured are not racist. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected. \nPeople who warn about radical Islamic terrorism are not Islamophobes. They\u2019re not. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold current values and keep our country safe. \nPeople who support police and who want crime reduced and stopped are not prejudiced and are not bad people. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost and oftentimes killed to preventable violence and it is preventable. \nHillary Clinton doesn\u2019t have to worry about sanctuaries cities or jobs moving overseas \u2013 where so many are moving. She is protected from her own policies. \nThe policies of Hillary Clinton have produced failing schools, shrinking incomes, and the tragic poverty and joblessness in our inner cities. Our inner cities are a disaster. \nOur campaign is dedicated to changing these policies to make life better for all Americans. \nWe are the campaign of school choice. \nWe are the campaign dedicated to improving economic conditions for every African-American and Hispanic worker. And we are doing amazingly well with African-American and Hispanic workers. You\u2019ve been seeing that over the last week. \nWe are the campaign that will deliver a government of, by, and for the people. \nThis change agenda includes a new foreign and new military policy. \nWe are going to put the failed policy of the past, and there are many, behind us, ideally way behind us. \nWe will empower our generals to do the job they were hired to do, and that begins with defeating and destroying ISIS. \nThank you. \nTo this day, she won\u2019t take accountability for her role in unleashing \u2013 and that\u2019s what happened \u2013 unleashing ISIS across the Middle East or for putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons. \nAnd as far as ISIS is concerned, probably unleashing ISIS here. We\u2019d better be very smart, tough, and vigilant or we\u2019re going to have big problems. \nHillary Clinton believes she\u2019s above the law, that she is above accountability, and that she is above each and every one of you. \nOur campaign is about giving voice to the voiceless. It\u2019s about representing the forgotten men and women of this country, and they have been forgotten. \nI\u2019m here to represent everyone, but especially those who are struggling against injustice and unfairness. \nI am running so that the powerful can no longer beat up on the powerless. \nI\u2019m running to take on the special interests, the big donors, and the corrupt political insiders. And of course, never forget, the special interests. \nI am running to be your voice. \nHillary Clinton is a voice for Wall Street, for hedge fund managers, for the top ten percent, and really the top one percent and even less than that. \nJust look at the people funding Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and paying for her speeches \u2013 tremendous amounts of money \u2013 and you know who she will be representing if she ever won, which I don\u2019t believe is going to happen. \nIn fact, if you look at the recent polls, the ones over the last few days, we\u2019re doing very well. That I can tell you. \nThe disdain that Hillary Clinton expressed towards millions of decent Americans disqualifies her from public service. \nYou cannot run for president if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter and she does. \nYou can\u2019t lead this nation if you have such a low opinion for its citizens. \nHillary Clinton still hasn\u2019t apologized to those she slandered. \nIn fact, she hasn\u2019t backed down at all. She\u2019s double downed on her campaign conspiracy and contempt. \nIf Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, I don\u2019t see how she can credibly campaign any further. \nLet\u2019s be clear. These were not off-hand comments from Hillary Clinton. These were...[inaudible]...remarks not at all. They were given also in an interview and probably a number of interviews. These were lengthy, planned and prepared remarks. \nIt was perhaps that most explicit attack on the American voter ever spoken by a major party presidential nominee. Total disrespect for the people of our country. \nClinton was using a very deliberate page from the Democratic playbook. Smearing someone with one of the names, you know those names, in order, really, in order to scare and I mean try and seriously scare them out of voting for change. \nAnd we\u2019re bringing change. She can\u2019t bring change. She has been doing this for 35 years. She now talks about change. There\u2019s no change. \nOur support comes from every part of America and every walk of life. \nWe have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, the young and the old, and millions of working class families who just want a better future and a good job. \nThese were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized. \nThese were among the countless Americans that Hillary Clinton called deplorable, irredeemable and un-American. \nNobody\u2019s heard anything like this. \nShe called these patriotic men and women every vile name in the book \u2013 she called them racist, sexist, xenophobic, and Islamophobic. \nShe called half of our supporters a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d in both a speech and an interview. \nShe divides people into baskets as though they were objects, not human beings. \nHillary Clinton made these comments at one of her high-dollar fundraisers in Wall Street. She and her wealthy donors all had a good laugh. You heard them. They were laughing. Good, good solid laugh. They were laughing at the very people who pave the roads \u2013 and these are the roads that she with all of her security drives on, paint the buildings she speaks in, and importantly all of the other functions. I mean if you think all functions in life, including this auditorium and its maintenance. \nHillary Clinton is an insider, supported by powerful insiders, attacking Americans who have absolutely no political power. \nHillary Clinton spoke with hatred and derision for the people who make this country run. \nShe spoke with contempt for the people who thanklessly follow the rules, pay their taxes, and scratch out a living for their families. A hard-earned living too. \nWhile Hillary Clinton lives a sequestered life behind gates and walls and guards, she mocks and demeans hardworking Americans who only want their own families to enjoy a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians. \nAfter months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton has revealed her true thoughts. That was her true thoughts. \nShe revealed herself to be a person who looks down on the proud citizens of our country as subjects for her rule. She views it as her rule. \nHer comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led to violation of federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails. Nobody\u2019s ever done anything like that before. Put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her foundation. \nIt\u2019s the same attitude that explains why Hillary Clinton refuses to take accountability for the deadly disasters she helped to create in Iraq, in Syria, and in Libya. \nThank you very much. This is a great honor and I am very, very grateful for being here today in front of so many distinguished people. \nI\u2019ve met more generals than I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. I like them and they like me. A lot of endorsements I can tell you. \nMy special gratitude to General [Deborah] Ashenhurst and General [Gus] Hargett, and to each and every one of you. Thank you very much. \nThe National Guard of the United States has defended this nation at war, kept our citizens safe at home, and rushed into danger wherever it has threatened our people. Our debt to you is eternal. \nYesterday was the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. \nThe National Guard was sent to assist in the aid and recovery, and these are serious, serious bad days for our country \u2013 he recovery efforts at Ground Zero in New York City. And I was there. I know what you went through. \nSince 9/11, there have been 780,000 members of the National Guard deployed overseas, including those with multiple deployments. \nRight now 10,000 members of the National Guard are in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other countries all across the world and doing an unbelievable job. \nMembers of the National Guard come from all walks of life, work in every kind of job imaginable, and juggle a thousand different challenges as they raise their kids, serve their states, and answer the call of duty for their country. \nIf I am given the honor to serve as your president, which I think will happen but we\u2019re going soon find out. We hope. \nAnd if it does happen, I will pledge to give you the resources, the equipment, and the support you need and deserve and that you\u2019re not getting. \nYou will have a true and loyal friend in the White House. \nWhether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion. I will not let you down. \nI am running to be a president for all Americans, and I\u2019ve been especially humbled to have the support of so many of our men and women in uniform. All Americans, you know what I mean. \nAll across this country, I\u2019ve met so many incredible members of both our military and law enforcement community. \nThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve enjoyed more than the time I\u2019ve spent with our service members, police officers, and also our firefighters and paramedics. These are incredible people. They embody the goodness and decency of our country. \nI was thus deeply shocked and alarmed this Friday to hear my opponent attack, slander, smear, demean these wonderful, amazing people who are supporting our campaign by the millions. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks in Walterboro, South Carolina", "text": "So here\u2019s what we did. We spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives lost, wounded warriors who we all love all over the place. They\u2019re the best people. Most incredible. They\u2019re tougher than all of us these people. I mean, what they\u2019ve gone through. So the wounded warriors all over the place. You know what we have? We have nothing. We have nothing. We have absolutely nothing. So here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019re going to change things around. We\u2019re going to be smart. And we have \u2013 we\u2019ll do what we have to do in terms of ISIS and all. But we have to start rebuilding our country. \nWe have $4 trillion in the various places. $4 trillion. Not going to happen anymore. \nWe\u2019re going to have a strong military. But we\u2019re going to have to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools, our hospitals. \nI mean, our country is like a third world country. You go over to Qatar, you go over to some of these places in the Middle East. You go to China. You see the airports. You see the bridges. They have bridges that are so incredible you\u2019ve never seen anything like it. They have railroad trains that go 350 miles an hour and we have things that go chug, chug, chug, chug like from 100 years ago. \nWe\u2019ve become like a third world nation because we\u2019re fighting everybody else\u2019s battles. And remember this, we are like the policemen of the world but we don\u2019t get paid anything. We protect Germany. We protect Japan. Do you know that in Japan if we get attacked, we have a treaty with Japan, if we get attacked they don\u2019t have to do anything. If they get attacked, we have World War III, we have to protect them. Okay? I mean, who makes these deals? \nWe protect as an example South Korea, who have a maniac right next to them. Right? But we protect South Korea. So every time we order televisions, they come from South Korea, they make a fortune. We protect South Korea. Let me tell you something. Why aren\u2019t they paying? They pay peanuts for what we do. \nEvery time this guy, you know, raises his head, we see our ships start to sail, our soldiers get ready. We have 28,000 soldiers at the border. \nSo we take care of the world. We don\u2019t get it. \nSaudi Arabia, before the oil went down, they were making $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. And we rent space there so we can help them. We rent military bases. We pay rent. And yet without us they wouldn\u2019t last for two weeks. They\u2019d be gone. \nSo we\u2019re going to change all that stuff folks. I mean, I want to be good. We want to be fair. We want to have heart. And we\u2019re not going to let these Syrian folks in that we don\u2019t know who they are. We don\u2019t know where they come from. They\u2019re not coming into this country. They\u2019re not coming in. \nI mean, there are a lot of them. I don\u2019t know if you know it. You have a lot of them moving into South Carolina. I don\u2019t know. Have you heard this? And you ought to tell your governor don\u2019t let them move to South Carolina. You don\u2019t want them in South Carolina. \nAnd I know they\u2019ll say, \u201cWell, we have nothing to do. We\u2019re state government.\u201d Let me tell you something. If a governor from a state didn\u2019t want to have them, I don\u2019t care what it says, you don\u2019t have to have them... \nWe want to help them with safe zones. We want to get the Gulf States to pay. I don\u2019t want to pay. We owe $19 trillion. We owe enough. We can lead it but let the Gulf States \u2013 they have so much money they don\u2019t know what to do with it. Let them build safe zones. \nLook at what\u2019s happening in Germany. It\u2019s a mess. Look at Sweden. Look at Brussels. I mean, Brussels, you go there 20 years ago, 15 years ago it was incredible. \nSo when I call for moratoriums and I call for this, first I get hit with tremendous heat. Right? Then everybody starts to say, \u201cYou know, he\u2019s right.\u201d \nSame thing \u2013 on June 16th, I announced we\u2019ve got to stop illegal immigration. The heat I took was unbelievable. Three, four weeks later they\u2019re all saying, you know, Trump is right. Then Kate killed in San Francisco, beautiful Kate, by an illegal immigrant. You have Jamiel in Los Angeles killed. Incredible guy. Young man. The father\u2019s a friend of mine \u2013 a great guy. You had the veteran \u2013 65-year-old woman \u2013 a veteran raped, sodomized, and killed in Los Angeles by an illegal immigrant. We\u2019ve got to stop it folks. We\u2019ve got to stop it. We\u2019ve got to be smart. We\u2019ve got to be a country again. We\u2019ve got to be a country again. \nSo I just want to thank \u2013 this endorsement meant so much to me from these two guys and from the whole community. I just want to say get out and vote. We\u2019re going to do something you\u2019re going to be so happy with. We\u2019re going to win so much and we\u2019re going to make America great again. That\u2019s what we want to do. Make America great again. So Saturday, get out and vote. Thank you! We love you all. Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you very much folks. \nAnd think about Boeing. Okay? Think about Boeing. Boeing is building a plant over here. Boeing just had a big order from China. But China is making them build a massive airline facility. Right? Massive. Like bigger than anything you\u2019ve seen. \nOkay, you feel good about Boeing right now. Tell me in five years. Unless I\u2019m president. You\u2019ll be fine. Don\u2019t worry about it. But tell me in five years you\u2019re going to feel good about Boeing because I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s happening. They are going to build that plant \u2013 they\u2019re building it, it\u2019s going to be finished soon \u2013 they\u2019re going to build that plant, they\u2019re going to devalue the hell out of their currency, and all of a sudden you\u2019ll be reading a big front page story all over the place that Boeing is going to leave, right, South Carolina, they\u2019re going to make all their planes in China. Because this is what they do. That\u2019s what they do. And our leaders aren\u2019t smart enough to stop it, okay? \nI have Carl Icahn endorse me. Great businessman, very rich guy, very, very successful. If I told Carl, Carl, watch over China trade, we\u2019re going to be in great shape. \nWe have right now people that have no concept of what they\u2019re doing. They have no concept of what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re political hacks. That\u2019s what they are. They\u2019re political hacks and these are the people that are negotiating with these people China. And again, China likewise, I get along great with China. Largest bank in the world my tenant. They buy condos for tens of millions of dollars. I have the Bank of America building in California. I own a big chunk of that. I got that through China through a very complex set of transactions but through China. \nI mean, I think China is terrific. I\u2019m not angry at China. I\u2019m angry at our leaders for not being able to compete with China. I\u2019m not angry. \nSo we\u2019re going to get things changed around. We\u2019re going to use our best people. We\u2019re going to be so smart, and we\u2019re going to start winning again. We\u2019re going to have strong borders. We\u2019re going to have strong military. We\u2019re going to take care of our vets. We\u2019re going to have such great trade deals. We\u2019re going to win again. We\u2019re going to win again. We\u2019re going to win so much. \nAnd you know, and by the way, we are going to get rid of ISIS and we\u2019re going to get rid of them fast. \nI was against the war in Iraq from the beginning. I was against the war in Iraq. We shouldn\u2019t have done it. We did it. Then Obama got out the wrong way. We shouldn\u2019t have done Iraq. We did it. It destabilized the Middle East. Exactly. If you go back, you could see 2003, 2004, I said it\u2019s going to totally destabilize the Middle East because you had Iran and Iraq and they were the same militarily. They\u2019d fight, fight, fight. Boom. Then they\u2019d rest. Then they\u2019d fight, fight, fight for years and years and years. We decapitated Iraq and now Iran is taking over. Not only do they get the $150 billion. Maybe the worst transaction I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated. No, no, don\u2019t buy the famous Obama administration. \nThe worst, one of the dumbest deals I\u2019ve ever seen. I mean, we get nothing. We get nothing. \nWe should have gotten those hostages before we started even negotiating. Not now. We should have gotten them years ago. \nBut if you look at what\u2019s going on and now on top of that we gave them Iraq because Iran is now taking over Iraq. It\u2019s just taking them over.\n... \nAnd they said, \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d I said I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m going to do because you know they talk about free trade. I\u2019m a free trader. But I say oh if I put a tax on these characters \u2013 these idiots. I mean, they\u2019re like stupid. They say \u201cDonald Trump is not a true conservative because he taxes.\u201d It\u2019s got to be fair stuff, folks. It\u2019s got to be fair. I\u2019m a conservative person. \nHey, I\u2019m the most conservative on the border. I\u2019m the most conservative with the military. Nobody\u2019s tougher than me. I\u2019m the most conservative. We are going to make our military so big, so strong, so powerful, nobody\u2019s ever going to mess with us, folks. We won\u2019t have to use it. \nI\u2019m the most conservative on taking care of the vets. Our vets are treated horribly. We\u2019re going to take care of our \u2013 I\u2019m the most conservative on Common Core. We\u2019re ending Common Core \u2013 I told you that \u2013 and we\u2019re moving it locally. And nobody is more conservative and we call toughness but nobody is more conservative on the Second Amendment. So all of these things. \nBut with Carrier...they\u2019re coming across and they\u2019re going to build a plant and probably get some subsidies from Mexico \u2013 probably \u2013 we\u2019ve probably given them subsidies. They probably have the United States giving subsidies to move out of the country. That\u2019s how stupid it is and that\u2019s how stupid we\u2019re running...They said, \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d I say it\u2019s very easy. We call them. We say let\u2019s have a meeting. Here\u2019s the story folks. You\u2019re moving to Mexico. Congratulations. But if you don\u2019t stay in the United States you\u2019re going to have a problem. But here\u2019s what you do it. You want to move to Mexico, build your factory, it\u2019s going to be wonderful. Hire your people they\u2019re not from the United States. All those people are now looking for jobs. Those are good jobs. You know we\u2019re hiring a lot of part-timers now...The numbers are totally phony. The 5% \u2013 totally phony numbers. So I say here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. Very simple. You build your plant in Mexico. Enjoy yourselves. And you\u2019re going to have air conditioners and just have them cross the border and sell them to the United States? No, you\u2019re going to pay a 35% tax on every air conditioner. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s the only thing you can do. \nAnd you know what? It\u2019s the only thing you can do. There\u2019s nothing else. Because otherwise how are you going to get them to stop? \nAnd then you have the devaluation with China. The all-time. They\u2019re like grand chess masters or grand \u2013 I mean these people are the greatest \u2013 the greatest in history. They\u2019re grandmasters of that \u2013 devaluation. They devalue their currency. \nJapan is doing very well too. They\u2019re killing Caterpillar. You know, they\u2019re ordering Komatsu tractors now because they\u2019ve devalued \u2013 look, you take a look at what\u2019s happened to the Yen and it\u2019s very hard. A friend a mine. He\u2019s a big excavator. You all know excavators. I love excavators. This guy\u2019s a very big one. He buys Caterpillar tractors all the time and excavators. He just put in a big order for Komatsu. Not that he wanted to. He said, \u201cDonald, they made it impossible for me not to buy. They\u2019ve devalued the yen to such an extent \u2013 Japan \u2013 that it made it, I mean, I owe it to my family, to my company, to myself. I have no choice.\u201d And he was like depressed. He wanted to buy Caterpillar... \nWell China is doing that times 100, times 1,000, and what they\u2019re doing is the devaluation of their currency makes it impossible for people to compete. We can\u2019t allow that stuff to happen. \nLook, when we send stuff over to China, it doesn\u2019t get in. If it does get in, you have to pay a big tax. You know, it\u2019s not supposed to be that way. You know, it\u2019s supposed to be free trade. It\u2019s supposed to be they come we go, back and forth. They devalued their currency and on top of it, they make it impossible. \nI have a friend who\u2019s a great manufacturer. He said it\u2019s virtually impossible to get his goods and he makes better stuff than they do. He can\u2019t get his goods into China. When he does get them in, there\u2019s a tax to pay. \nI have a friend who actually bought an airplane and he can\u2019t get it into China because the tax is so massive. He\u2019s going to sell it now at a big loss. Okay? \nThat\u2019s a little bit like what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m the least spent money. You know, I\u2019m funding my own campaign. Right? So, I don\u2019t have a lot of the people coming to me. You know, the drug companies and all of the \u2013 because if you would see the kind of waste, fraud, and corruption in the United States, a lot of it isn\u2019t really waste, fraud, and corruption. It\u2019s the fact that people that are running against me and people in the Senate, people in Congress, they have tremendous power because they have people giving them unbelievable campaign contributions and they\u2019re special interests and they do what those people want. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why our budget is out of whack, the military is out of whack. The military orders equipment they don\u2019t even want and the stuff they do want they don\u2019t get because the company that makes that equipment is like, you know, it\u2019s not politically adept, and companies that really are, they make the equipments we don\u2019t want. It\u2019s going to all change because I\u2019m not getting any money from all of these people. I don\u2019t give a damn. I mean, we\u2019re going to do the right thing. We\u2019re going to absolutely do the right thing. \nI\u2019ll tell you a little story. So the drug companies. We are the largest purchasers of drugs in the world, the United States...which makes a lot of sense I guess. But we purchase more drugs that make you better, drugs that make you better, not the kind of drugs that come over the southern border, which we\u2019re going to end. Okay? We\u2019re going to build a wall. Yup. Folks, by the way, we\u2019re going to build a wall and who\u2019s going to pay for the wall? \nYou better believe it. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion. And these characters come up, these politicians that I\u2019m running against, \u201cYou don\u2019t really think Mexico is going to pay for the wall?\u201d I said, \u201cAbsolutely, 100%.\u201d They said, \u201cHow are you going to get Mexico to pay?\u201d And I don\u2019t want to get into it because they won\u2019t understand it. I mean, they have no concept of business. They have no \u2013 you know, the $150 billion we gave to Iran, these people have no concept. \nWe have a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico. Okay? The wall is going to cost $12 billion. Maybe less. If I build it, it\u2019ll be taller, better, and less. Okay? \nSo you think of this. So you think of this. So they said, \u201cHow are you going to possibly do it?\u201d \nThey make so much money. Plus we give them subsidy. They make so much money from the United States it\u2019s going to be one of the easiest things. \nAnd I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard, one of the presidents or ex-presidents of Mexico held a news conference. He said, \u201cWe will never ever, ever pay for the wall.\u201d And the press called me. They said, \u201cThey said they will never pay for the wall.\u201d I said, \u201cWho was it?\u201d Calderon. He\u2019s very nice, good guy. I said, \u201cTell him the following. The wall just got 10 feet higher.\u201d I mean it. It got 10 feet higher. Yeah, they\u2019re going to pay for it. \nAnd I get along great with Mexico. The problem is \u2013 I mean, they buy apartments. I have hundreds and hundreds and even thousands of workers are Hispanics who I\u2019m doing great with. We have such an amazing relationship with Hispanics and they\u2019re great people. \nThe problem is the leaders of Mexico are too smart for our leaders. They\u2019re too smart. They\u2019re too cunning. \nYou look at what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s unbelievable. The border is a disaster. It\u2019s a sieve. People flow over. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore, folks. People can come into our country but they\u2019re going to come in legally. They\u2019re going to come in through a process. They\u2019re going to come in, they\u2019re going to come in legally. \nSo with trade, we\u2019re going to solve the trade problem. I don\u2019t know if you saw Carrier air conditioner announced two days ago they\u2019re moving to Mexico. Nabisco. They\u2019re moving their big plant from Chicago to Mexico. Ford, they\u2019re moving this massive complex \u2013 they\u2019re building a $2.5 billion plant and now they\u2019ve just announced they\u2019re building it bigger. \nI\u2019ve been talking about this for two years. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal, they announced they\u2019re building it bigger. In another words, they\u2019re doubling down. You know why? Nobody does anything about it. I\u2019m going to do something about it. \nSo I watched \u2013 somebody asked, \u201cWhat would you do about Carrier?\u201d Because that was a sad case. Somebody used their cell phone and they were telling them, \u201cYou\u2019re out of work. You\u2019re out of job. Forget it. It\u2019s over. We\u2019re moving to Mexico.\u201d Are crying. Grown men that have been there for a long time. Really incredible people. And they\u2019re crying and they\u2019re devastated and they lost their job and they\u2019ve never had another job and now this plant \u2013 this whole thing is moving to Mexico. \nYou know, New Hampshire was so amazing. We had a big, big victory in New Hampshire. Amazing people. \nAnd then we come down here and I said, \u201cYou know, I think we have an ever bigger lead over here.\u201d \nAnd the people have been incredible no matter where we go to speak. Even this. I know that four years ago, you had about 200 people here for the same kind of thing for your frontrunner and he\u2019s a good frontrunner, a good guy, and he did well but you had 400 people, 200 people. You have thousands of people here and we just appreciate it, and I won\u2019t forget it. Believe me, I\u2019m not going to forget it. I\u2019m not going to forget it. \nSo I hear that they\u2019re talking about trying to get a liberal judge and a judge that does not like the Second Amendment and a judge that \u2013 and this is one of many. This is one of many but a judge that doesn\u2019t want to do a number on the guns and that doesn\u2019t know how important it is. \nWe\u2019re just not going to let it happen. Okay? It\u2019s not going happen. And if we elected, we know that. But we have 9 months, 10 months to go. We have to have the Republicans hold fast because I\u2019m just hearing these little cracks, saying \u201cWell, maybe if he appoints somebody, maybe we could get along, maybe.\u201d It\u2019s not the way it\u2019s supposed to be. \nNow, it\u2019s possible that they\u2019ll have their wish because if they win, they\u2019re going to be having their choice. But if they don\u2019t win, we\u2019re going to start really taking back because we have 3 or 4 or 5 maybe Supreme Court judges. This was not supposed to be one in question. This was a very sad circumstance that happened with \u2013 I mean, really to me it was a very sad circumstance. But now we\u2019re going to see what happens. \nI will only tell you this. We are doing well. We have a really good chance to win. If we can win in South Carolina, we\u2019re going to go \u2013 I mean, we could very well run the table. \nI don\u2019t know if you saw \u2013 I guess a lot of you have seen actually next week in Nevada. It\u2019s going to be phenomenal. The relationship there to the people...Bush is 1% in Nevada. This guy \u2013 why doesn\u2019t he just give up, just go home? Go home. Go home to mom. Got to go home to mommy. You know, Bush is only at 1% in Nevada. A couple of them are, you know, at 10%, 11%, or 12%. I\u2019m at like 40% something \u2013 48%. So I think we\u2019re going to do well. \nThen I think we have the SEC. We\u2019re going to have the SEC, which is going to be I think amazing. \nBut really now we\u2019re starting. New Hampshire could not have been better. They gave us a tremendous send-off. They really started us on our way. \nAnd we did well in Iowa. I mean, some votes were stolen from Ben Carson, which by the way was a disgrace. What Cruz \u2013 what this guy Cruz did with Ben Carson was an absolute disgrace. What he did was \u2013 he stole. It\u2019s theft. And then they come out with a voter violation form, which is a fraud as far as I\u2019m concerned. And what he did with that whole thing was a disgrace. So we\u2019re not going to let that stuff happen anymore. I mean, we\u2019re not going to let it. We will not let it happen. We\u2019re all watching. You\u2019re all watching. Keep your eyes wide open. \nThese politicians \u2013 here\u2019s a guy, he raises the Bible and yet he tells fibs, he tells lies, and then he does this stuff to Carson and he does other things. Very bad. \nSo politicians are bad people. Boy, they are bad. Would you believe it? \nSo we\u2019re not going to let it happen and we\u2019re going to get in there...So Saturday. Go out and vote. This is going to be the place that\u2019s really going to make it. \nAnd honestly, I\u2019ve been watching all the pundits. Now, the bad news is they\u2019re always wrong. They all said I\u2019m not running and I ran. Well, how is he going to do? He\u2019s just doing this for fun. I\u2019m not doing this for fun. Believe me, I love this location but I know I can be someplace else. Okay? I could be someplace else right now. I could be very happy. \nBut I\u2019m doing it because you know the expression and I see all the hats in the audience \u2013 Make America great again. We are going to make America so ... [inaudible]... \nWe are going to win again. You know, we don\u2019t win very  much. You\u2019re very smart, tough people. You like to win. Right? This guy over here. You like to win. And we don\u2019t win anymore. We used to win. We don\u2019t win anymore. Well, we\u2019re going to start winning again. We\u2019re going to start winning again. \nSo, Second Amendment protected. Common Core. We\u2019re going to end Common Core. We\u2019re bringing your education locally. It\u2019s going to be fabulous. I don\u2019t know if you know or if you\u2019ve heard me say we have the absolute worst \u2013 we spend number one in the world on education. Right? Number one per pupil in the world. There is no second place because we\u2019re so high, so much \u2013 you have China, you have Norway, you have Denmark, you have Sweden. You have these countries are the best in terms of education and they\u2019re on the list the best. And the 30th in the top 30 \u2013 we\u2019re number 30th. Okay? We\u2019re number one in costs. \n...So it\u2019s so important. You getting out to vote. It\u2019s just so important because our country has been taken away from us. It\u2019s going so fast. \nAnd you know, you\u2019re talking about Second Amendment because I was asking with Randy and a lot of people, I was talking to some of the people before, \u201cWhat would you like me to focus on?\u201d and they said, \u201cJust Second Amendment. Second Amendment.\u201d \nNow, the Second Amendment means a lot of other things too...The Second Amendment in under siege. You know that. You know that very well. \nWe lost a great Supreme Court justice and nobody thought this was going to be part of the equation. And all of a sudden if somebody gets in that\u2019s the wrong person, they\u2019ll take away that Second Amendment so fast your head will spin. \nYou see Bloomberg is somebody that wants to knock out the Second Amendment. Hillary is a disaster on the Second Amendment. No, they want to take it away. \nSo, it\u2019s just not going to happen. It\u2019s not going to happen. \n...But we lost our wonderful justice who was a great man and a great Second Amendment person. \nI just heard coming up, you know, the Senators. We\u2019ve been very disappointed. I\u2019m a Republican. Many of you are Republicans. But we\u2019re not being protected whether it\u2019s a budget. You saw the budget that was approved a month ago. It was approved by the Republicans. They gave it away. They gave Obama everything. \nSo Obama wants to put in a Supreme Court judge. He said he wants \u2013 he\u2019s going to be a very negative person to guns because that\u2019s the way it is, okay? Believe me, that will be the way it is. And basically they don\u2019t have the right to do that. \nBut I keep saying, \u201cWell, are the Republicans going to fail or are they going to crack? What\u2019s going to happen?\u201d And coming up today, I hear, \u201cWell, there could be a way of Obama pushing it through.\u201d Here we go, right? Here we go. \nSame thing you heard with Obamacare. It\u2019s going to be defeated. It\u2019s going to be repealed. We\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Believe me. \nBut \u2013 I mean, look what\u2019s going on with your premiums. 35%, 45%, 55% up. Your deductible is so high. I mean, you\u2019ve got to see that truck right there? You\u2019ve got to get hit by that truck in order to ever use it. \nSo, I come up and I\u2019m hearing that Obama now who said by the way yesterday, \u201cDonald Trump will not be the president. He will not be.\u201d No, it\u2019s a compliment. Look, he\u2019s been perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States. So it\u2019s a compliment. \nBut he was all over the place yesterday. Said, \u201cDonald Trump will not be \u2013 \u201c I think we have maybe a little surprise in store, and we start right here in South Carolina. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania", "text": "Of course, in the future, if I\u2019m president, there won\u2019t be Obamacare, so you won\u2019t have to worry about it. \nThat means parents won\u2019t have enough money to pay their bills or get medicine for their kids. \nIn the great state of Arizona, a wonderful place I just left, premiums will go up even higher than 116%. \nOther states are going up more than 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%. \nDeductibles can go to $12,000, $13,000, $14,000, even $15,000. \nIn other words, your health care won\u2019t even be usable. You\u2019re paying all this money. You won\u2019t even get to use it. \nPeople all across the country are devastated. In many instances, their health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent, which by the way is a first in American history. \nThis is particularly unfair to millennials and younger Americans generally who will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through life. \nOne-third of the counties \u2013 think of this \u2013 one-third of the counties in Pennsylvania will have only a single insurance company left, if you have that. That includes Philadelphia where I went to school. \nThe Associated Press found that some of the 440,000 Pennsylvania consumers who buy insurance through healthcare.gov will face some of the highest premium increases in the nation. People of Philadelphia. \nInsurers are leaving. Premiums are soaring. Doctors are quitting. Companies are fleeing. And deductibles go through the roof. \nWorkers\u2019 hours are being cut. Hiring is frozen. Totally frozen. And wages are being slashed. \nObamacare means higher prices, fewer choices, and lower quality. \nYet, Hillary Clinton wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. \nShe wants to put the government totally in charge of health care in America. \nIf we don\u2019t repeal and replace Obamacare, we will destroy American health care forever. \nIt\u2019s one of the single most important reasons why we must win on Nov. 8th. We must win. \nThank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. \nOur replacement plan includes health savings accounts, a nationwide insurance market where you can purchase across state lines, and letting states manage Medicaid dollars. So much better. \nWe will create quality, reliable, affordable health care in a free market where parents can make the health care decisions that they really want to make for their families. \nIt will be a much better health care at a much less expensive cost. \nWe\u2019ve also outlined detailed solutions on so many other issues to make life better for every American family. \nAnd while this is really a meeting and that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s a meeting of very, very special people, and I appreciate you all being here. \nI\u2019m running to restore honesty to our government and safety to our communities. We need safety. \nAnd by the way, our law enforcement officials \u2013 these are great, great people. \nThank you. \nAnd we are going to give great prosperity to our economy. \nI want to go into our poorest communities and work on a national plan of revitalization. The inner cities. \nAnd I\u2019ve been working with so many African-American groups. These are such incredible people. We\u2019ve been talking about it, working on it. \nWe\u2019re going to bring jobs into the inner cities. We\u2019re going to bring safety. We\u2019re going to education \u2013 good, good schools into the inner city. \nThe spirit of the people in the inner cities is beyond the spirit of anybody, and it\u2019s going to work. It\u2019s going to work. You watch. \nAmericans are tired of being told to defer their dreams to another day. But politicians for the most part really mean another decade because that\u2019s what they\u2019re talking about. \nEnough waiting. Time is now. \nBut to accomplish our goals, we must cut our ties with the small, bitter, petty politics of our past. \nWe must declare our independence from a failed establishment that has squandered $6 trillion on foreign wars in the Middle East that never end, that we never win, and that have made us far less safe. \nThink of it. Think of all the money they\u2019ve spent, all the lives that have been lost. And we\u2019re far less safe today than we were before we started. \nThey\u2019ve left our borders wide open at home and shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. \nIt\u2019s time for new leadership. \nThank you. \nI\u2019ve led a great life and I truly love our country. So now I want to give back to the country that\u2019s been so good to me. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this. \nAll I see everywhere I travel in this nation, and I\u2019ve been everywhere is untapped potential waiting to be realized. \nThe people are amazing. The people are amazing. \nIf we unlock the potential of this country and its incredible people, no dream is outside of our reach. \nIf we stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in ourselves, then anything \u2013 anything \u2013 is possible. \nI\u2019m asking you to dream big, to push for bold change, and to believe in a movement powered by our love for each other and our love for our country. \nThat is how we will truly make America great again. \nThank you. Thank you very much... \nWe will let parents deduct child care expenses from their taxes and create tax free child care and elder care savings accounts with matching contributions for low-income families. \nWe will eliminate the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. \nWhen did we ever need it more? Greatest people on Earth in our military but it\u2019s badly depleted. \nThank you. People love this country, don\u2019t they? Isn\u2019t it beautiful? Right? Beautiful. It\u2019s a beautiful thing to watch and to see and I see it all over the country no matter where we go. And every time I say we are going to rebuild our depleted military, it\u2019s always the same response. It\u2019s an incredible response. \nOur Navy is the smallest it\u2019s been since World War I. Think of that. Smallest since World War I. And rebuilding it will require a national effort. \nThat\u2019s why I will ask my Secretary of the Navy to review facilities like the Philadelphia Navy Yard \u2013 I know it well \u2013 with a long history of service to our Navy, proximity to vibrant private industry, and room for expansion to enlist them in the rebuilding of what will be a great fleet again. \nTo recruit master craftsman this build-up requires and we will establish centers of excellence at locations like the Philadelphia Navy Yard. \nVocational training is a great thing. We don\u2019t do it anymore. We don\u2019t do it anymore. \nAnd I must tell you, so often and going to college right down the road, in going to college, we\u2019d have people that were brilliant and we had other people that weren\u2019t as brilliant in that way but were brilliant \u2013 incredible when it came to fixing a motor, when it came to fixing something that I had no idea what was happening and other great geniuses have no idea what was happening and they could take it apart blindfolded. And we don\u2019t that anymore. \nVocational training for our country is so, so, so important. \nAnd just in closing that and they loved it. They loved it. They didn\u2019t want to be doing what I was doing. They loved it. They were so good at it and they loved it. \nSo vocational training. We\u2019re going to start it up big league. \nWe will rebuild our military and we will rebuild our country. \nI\u2019m not a politician. My only special interest is you, the American people. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve done it. \nThank you. Thank you very much. \nThe guiding rule of the political class in Washington D.C. is that they are looking out only for themselves. Only for themselves. With the exception of these few people. \nI feel guilty. As I\u2019m looking, they\u2019re staring me in the eyes. So I have to say with these exceptions. \nThey will say anything and do anything and cling to their power and prestige at your expense. \nI\u2019m running to change and reverse decades of failure and to work with the American people to create generations of success. \nBut it\u2019s a meeting talking about health care and Obamacare, our plan for other things also include the bringing back of manufacturing jobs. We have to do it. \nWe\u2019re going to bring back our manufacturing \u2013 we\u2019re going to bring back our jobs that form the backbone of the American middle class and our country as a whole. \nOur jobs are being stolen. Pennsylvania has lost almost 40% of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton. \nThe city of Philadelphia has lost more than one-third of its manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary backed disaster. \nA Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA. Believe me. And we have the greatest negotiators in the world, and we will use our great negotiators. \nWe\u2019ll have a fair deal but we\u2019ll have a deal that goes in two directions, not one direction right into Mexico and these other places. \nAnd stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation, and unfair subsidy behavior. \nWe are going to bring manufacturing jobs \u2013 lots of jobs \u2013 back to Pennsylvania. We\u2019re going to do it. And it won\u2019t even be difficult. \nWe\u2019re going to open modern mines and take care of our great miners. Our miners have been mistreated horrible. \nWe will be producing clean coal, oil, natural gas, and shale energy. \nWe\u2019re also bringing back our steel workers who have been so badly hurt. So badly hurt. Whose jobs have been stolen by the dumping of steel all over this state and frankly all over this country by China and other countries. \nNobody has been treated worse than these workers. But that will change on Jan. 20th of next year. Believe me. It will change. \nWe\u2019re also going to provide the children of this state with school choice. So important. That means parents can spend and take care of their children but they can send their kids to public school, to private, to charter, to magnet, to religious, or to home school. It\u2019s going to be their right, and it\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s so, so good for your children and for the education of your children. \nWe will also totally eliminate Common Core and bring education local. We\u2019re going to bring it local. \nPeople do not like Common Core in this country. That I can tell you. \nAnd our system is failing so it\u2019s obviously not working. So we\u2019re going to eliminate Common Core. We\u2019re going to bring it local. \nOur tax plan will provide a 35% tax cut to middle class families with two kids. \nAs an example, you have two kids, 35% cut, so desperately needed. Our middle class has not been properly respected. That I can tell you. \nI would like to thank my incredible running mate, Gov. Mike Pence. Thank you. And I love you too. \nWe have a lot of very enthused and excited people in this campaign so I really do thank all of you. \nI would like to thank my incredible running mate, Mike Pence, on the tremendous job he\u2019s done, and he\u2019s a fantastic leader and leader on health care issues. And to have him involved is just my very great honor. Believe me. \n...[Acknowledgements of public officials and dignitaries omitted]\n \nWhen we win on Nov. 8th and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. Have to do it. \nI will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace, and it will be such an honor for me, for you, and for everybody in this country because Obamacare has to be replaced. And we will do it and we will do it very, very quickly. It is a catastrophe. \nThe president said if you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, which may go down as one of the great political lies of the century. \nEven the skeptical Democrats believed him and approved the legislation. There were Democrats that were very much against it but they believed him and they approved it. \nNo one ever read or certainly very few people the 2,700 page bill. To this day, nobody understands it. \nThe Obama administration has just announced massive double-digit and triple-digit Obamacare premium hikes everywhere all throughout the country. \nHere in Pennsylvania, premiums are going to increase more than 60%, and that\u2019s nothing compared to what will happen in the future.

However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women. \nYou\u2019ve called women you don\u2019t like \u201cfat pigs\u201d, \u201cdogs\u201d, \u201cslobs\u201d, and \u201cdisgusting animals\u201d. \nYour Twitter account \u2013 \nQuestion:\nNo, it wasn\u2019t. \nYour Twitter account \u2013 for the record, it was well beyond Rosie O\u2019Donnell. \nQuestion:\nYour Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women\u2019s looks. \nYou once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. \nDoes that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as President? \nAnd how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who is likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women? \nI\u2019ve been challenged by so many people and I don\u2019t frankly have time for total political correctness. \nAnd to be honest with you, this country doesn\u2019t have time either. \nThis country is in big trouble. We don\u2019t win anymore. We lose to China. We lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border. We lose to everybody. \nAnd frankly what I say and oftentimes it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s kidding. We have a good time. What I say is what I say. \nAnd honestly, Megan, if you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be based on the way that you\u2019ve treated me but I wouldn\u2019t do that. \nBut you know what? We \u2013 we need strength. We need energy. We need quickness. And we need brain in this country to turn it around. That I can tell you right now.

He\u2019s number 11. He\u2019s got 1% in the polls. And how he got up here \u2013 there\u2019s far too many people anyway. \nAs far as temperament and we all know that. As far as temperament, I think I have a great temperament. \nI\u2019ve built a phenomenal business with incredible iconic assets \u2013 one of the really truly great real estate businesses. \nAnd I may be an entertainer because I\u2019ve had tremendous success with number one best sellers all over the place with the Apprentice and everything else I\u2019ve done. \nBut I will tell you this what I am far and away greater than an entertainer is a businessman and that\u2019s the kind of mindset that this country needs to bring it back. \nBecause we owe $19 trillion right now. $19 trillion. And you need this kind of thinking to bring our country back. \nAnd believe me, my temperament is very good, very calm. But we will be respected outside of this country. We are not respected now. \nQuestion on Bush\u2019s attack on Trump as not a serious candidate: \nObviously I\u2019m doing pretty well. I\u2019m number one in every poll by a lot. \nBut the qualification is that I\u2019ve dealt with people all over the world, been successful all over the world. \nEverything I\u2019ve done virtually has been a tremendous success. \nWhen markets changed, when things turned, I heard Gov. Pataki who by the way was a failed governor in New York. A very seriously failure. He wouldn\u2019t be elected dog catcher right now. \nI heard what he had to say and I will tell you this: Atlantic City \u2013 I made a tremendous amount of money in Atlantic City. I left seven years ago. I\u2019ve gotten great credit for my timing. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m about. \nI\u2019m a businessman. Did really well. Really well. \nAnd Jeb, what I want to do is to put that ability into this country to make our country rich again. And I can do that and I\u2019m not sure that anybody else in the group will be able to do that.

We have to have assimilation. \nI\u2019m not the first one to say this...We have many people over the years for many, many years saying the same thing. \nThis is a country where we speak English, not Spanish. \nJeb Bush: \nWell, I\u2019ve been speaking English here tonight and I\u2019ll keep speaking English. \nBut the simple fact is if a high school kid asks me a question in Spanish \u2013 a school by the way a voucher program that was created under my watch, the largest voucher program in the country where kids can go to a Christian school and they ask me a question in Spanish, I\u2019m going to show respect and answer that question in Spanish even though they do speak English and even though they embrace American values.

I mean, you go to Qatar...you go to any \u2013 so many places, you go to different places in China, different places in Asia, different places in the Middle East, you look at some of the airports they have, you look at the roadways they have, you look at the transportation systems they have and the trains they have, we\u2019re like a third world country. \nSo I\u2019m going to be very good for the world. I\u2019m going to get along with the world. You\u2019re going to be very proud of me. Even you will be very proud of me as a president. \nBut we have to rebuild our country. Our country is going to hell and people don\u2019t understand that. \nAnd Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t have a clue. She can\u2019t do that. She\u2019s talking about \u2013 I mean, one of the things that really bothered me \u2013 I think one of the reasons I have such great support \u2013 is that people \u2013 you take a look \u2013 people in the middle income groups are making less money today \u2013 less money \u2013 than they made 12 years ago. And in her speech she said they\u2019re making less money. Well, she\u2019s been there with Obama for a long period of time. Why hasn\u2019t she done anything about it? Practically everything she was complaining about, she\u2019s picked up what I say. The difference is she\u2019s been there for a long period of time. Why haven\u2019t they done anything about it? \nThen you look at her record as Secretary of State. It\u2019s abysmal. You look at what\u2019s going on with Syria. You look at what\u2019s going on with everything. It\u2019s a disaster. \nSo we\u2019re going to have an interesting period of time. I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s going to be allowed to run. What she did is a criminal act. If she\u2019s allowed to run, I would be very, very surprised. But if she\u2019s allowed to run, honestly, it\u2019ll be a sad day for this country because what she did was wrong. \nWhat she did \u2013 let me just tell you \u2013 what she did was wrong and other people have done far less than her and they\u2019ve paid a very, very big price. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWhat I really have is a great number of people. I have millions and millions of people. \nAnd when I was watching those broadcasts just a little while ago before I came in here because I wanted to see exactly where we were before I started speaking, I was amazed at the kind of numbers. The Republicans have tremendous energy. The Democrats don\u2019t. They don\u2019t have any energy. Their numbers are down. Our numbers are through the roof. And people are making statements that they\u2019ve never seen in modern times a party that was so energized. \nI think if somebody is doing as well as I\u2019m doing and I\u2019m not just speaking for myself, whether me or anybody else, but if I\u2019m going to win five \u2013 I\u2019ve already won five \u2013 but maybe it could be six, seven, eight, nine. It could be nine. I could win nine states tonight. If I\u2019m going to win all of these states with tremendous numbers and if I\u2019m going to come in the worst second in the two or three that I might not win, I think, you know, we\u2019re a democracy. I think it\u2019s awfully hard to say that\u2019s not the person we want to lead the party. Right? You know, it\u2019s very hard. \n...I really think that one of the biggest things that everybody is seeing happening \u2013 and everybody \u2013 is the Republican Party has become more dynamic. It\u2019s become more diverse. We\u2019re taking from the Democrats. We\u2019re taking from the independents. We have a lot more people. We have a lot more people. \nI mean, take a look at South Carolina. Look at the numbers. Look at the numbers from four years ago when nobody even wanted to waste their time and vote. And then you look at the \u2013 I was there. And you had lines that went a mile long, and it was virtually more than doubled. \nSo we have a very, very dynamic party. And I think we\u2019re going to be able to unify the party. I hope to be able to get along with everybody. \nI don\u2019t know Paul Ryan well but I hope to be able to get along with him. \nI do know Mitch McConnell a little bit but I hope to be able to get along with him. \nBut remember this, I have millions and millions and millions of people. This isn\u2019t like it\u2019s a close match. I mean, it\u2019s only too bad that winner didn\u2019t take all because if winner took all, this is over; we\u2019re just having a celebration. You know, we\u2019re having a celebration. \nSo anyway, I would like to \u2013 look, I just want to end by thanking everybody. This has been an amazing period in my life. \nMy wife just called, and Ivanka, as you know, is going to be having a baby very soon and she\u2019s a special person. It\u2019s going to be great and we look forward to that. She\u2019s back in New York. She wanted to be here. They all want to be here but they\u2019re with Ivanka now and that could be certainly within the next week. \nBut this has been an amazing period of time. It\u2019s been amazing for me even from an educational standpoint. \nAnd I think honestly we\u2019ve done something that almost nobody thought could be done and I\u2019m very proud of it. \nAnd I just want to leave you with this: I am a unifier. I would love to see the Republican Party and everybody get together and unify. \nAnd when we unify, there\u2019s nobody \u2013 nobody \u2013 that\u2019s going to beat us. \nThank you very much everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nFirst of all, we\u2019re going to do great with the African-Americans and you see that in the polls where I had 25%. And one of the commentators who I think is standing right in the back of the room in the corner said, \u201cYou know, if Donald Trump gets 25% of the African-American vote, this election is over. You watch.\u201d \nAnd the reason that I\u2019m getting that \u2013 and I\u2019m going to do great with the Hispanics. I\u2019m going to do great with virtually every group. The reason is I\u2019m going to bring jobs back. I\u2019m going to get Apple to start making their computers...on our land, not in China. How does it help us when they make it in China? So I\u2019m going to create jobs. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd honestly, I did. I always liked him. But he became, you know, somebody told him \u201cYou\u2019re losing very badly. The only way you can possibly win, take the Hail Mary.\u201d They called it the Hail Mary. The folks in the back. And go hostile. It hurt him. \nIn fact, one of the newscasts tonight said he went down 15% to 20%. It\u2019s really hurt him. \nBut look, I\u2019m not going to tell him what to do. I\u2019m not going to tell anybody what to do. You have to run. He had a bad night. \nAccording to CNN, Fox, I watched their broadcast. They said the loser of the night was Marco Rubio, and it\u2019s true. He didn\u2019t win anything. He hasn\u2019t won. \nI mean, at least you can say that Ted has won something. And you know, Marco has not won. You\u2019ve got to be able to win. You can\u2019t talk. You know these politicians. All talk no action. You\u2019ve got to be able to win something. He hasn\u2019t won anything. And he actually hasn\u2019t come very close. So we\u2019ll see what happens. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nRadical Islamic terrorism \u2013 big, big problem. Not only for us. You take a look at Germany. You take a look at Sweden. You take a look at Brussels. You look at some of these places it\u2019s like a disaster. \nAnd we\u2019re not going to allow people to come into our country who we have no idea who they are, we have no idea where they come from. They have no paperwork. They\u2019re young and they\u2019re strong. You look at that migration line. They\u2019re young. They\u2019re strong. They\u2019re powerful. And you say, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they back fighting for their country?\u201d \nNow, with all of that being said, I feel strongly \u2013 I have a bigger heart than anybody \u2013 we\u2019re going to build a safe zone. It\u2019s going to be in Syria. And I\u2019m going to get the Gulf States who have more money than anybody \u2013 we got to loosen up their wallets a little bit. We\u2019re going to get \u2013 but they\u2019re not accepting people. We\u2019re going to get \u2013 wait, wait, wait \u2013 we\u2019re going to get the Gulf States to pay for it because they should. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \n...The ex-president of Mexico, the arrogance of this man, and I get along great with the Hispanics. You saw in Nevada, I won in the poll the Hispanic vote. I have thousands of people that work for me right now that are Hispanic. I\u2019ve had thousands and thousands over my lifetime. These are great people. \nThe Mexican leaders are too smart for our leaders, and you saw it. \nVincente Fox, first of all, he used a word that you should never have \u2013 if I ever used that word, you folks would have never ever ever let me get away with it. Nobody even talked about the word he used and this is the ultimate word. But he was angry at the concept of somebody saying that they were pay for the wall. \nMexico\u2019s going to pay for the wall. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. $58 billion. The wall is going to cost $10 billion. It\u2019s so easy. \nI\u2019m with these guys and I\u2019m on the stage \u2013 \u201cYou don\u2019t really mean Mexico is going to pay for the wall.\u201d As sure as you\u2019re standing there 100% Mexico is going to pay. 100%. \nAnd the reason is I\u2019m a businessman. I know how to do this. Politicians are all talk no action. It\u2019s not going to \u2013 except for Chris Christie, of course. It\u2019s not going to happen. It\u2019s not going to happen with these people. \nSo when you think of it \u2013 and then they say, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be able to build a wall.\u201d \nWell, it\u2019s 2,000 miles but we really only need 1,000 miles. \nThe Great Wall of China built 2,000 years ago is 13,000 miles, folks, and they didn\u2019t have Caterpillar tractors, because I only want to use Caterpillar if you want to know the truth. Or John Deere...I love John Deere too. But they didn\u2019t have tractors. They didn\u2019t have cranes. They didn\u2019t have excavation equipments. The wall is 13,000 miles long. \nWe need 1,000 miles. And we have all of the materials. We can do that so beautifully. And this is going to be a serious wall. This is going to be a high wall. They\u2019re going to be a very serious wall. We\u2019re going to stop drugs from coming into New Hampshire. \nYou know, when I won New Hampshire, those people were so incredible to me. And when you go, you wouldn\u2019t be able to believe it because it\u2019s so bucolic, so beautiful. You look at the fields and you look at everything. It\u2019s so beautiful. And yet, you go to a meeting in New Hampshire, their number one problem, their number one problem is heroin. The heroin is pouring in and they have so many of their young people and other people addicted. And I told them I\u2019m going to stop it. I\u2019m going to stop it. We\u2019re going to have a strong border and I mean strong. \nAnd by the way, speaking of people, people are going to come in and they\u2019re going to come into this country but they\u2019re going to come in legally. Okay? \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd when Chris called, he said, \u201cThis is a movement. This is something like I\u2019ve never seen.\u201d \nAnd in all fairness to the press, a lot of the press have said the same thing. They\u2019ve never seen what\u2019s happening right now. They\u2019ve never seen anything like it. And I\u2019m just honored by it. \nNow when Chris joined, we had a news conference and they asked me the exact same question and I said I disavow. \nNow after the program that we\u2019re talking about and I thought it was clear but you know we\u2019re talking about groups, groups, groups. I do have to know the name of the group because who knows? I mean, they have to give me the name of the groups. \nBut right after when I reviewed it, I put out a tweet and I put out on Facebook that I total disavow. \nNow everybody knew I did that but the press refused to look at that. That was right after, and I disavowed then. I disavowed today on ABC with George Stephanopoulos. I disavowed again. I mean, how many times are you supposed to disavow? \nBut I disavowed and hopefully it\u2019s the final time I have to do it. \nBut if you look at Facebook and if you look at Twitter right after the show I put out a statement because I want everybody to be sure. \nYes, go ahead \u2013 \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nSo, you know, look, you can\u2019t go around just signing our little notices that the president signs all the time \u2013 executive orders. He\u2019s signed executive order, executive order. It\u2019s almost like I don\u2019t even know. Does he even go and deal with Congress anymore? Does he ever speak to the Senate? Does he ever speak with congressmen and get them into a room and get things done? \nYou know, a good example of this in all fairness is something that I \u2013 it\u2019s very, very important to me \u2013 corporate inversion. \nCarl Icahn is a good friend of mine who endorsed me \u2013 great businessman. It bothers him so much. He calls me about it all the time. \nWe\u2019re losing companies. We\u2019re losing for two reasons. We\u2019re losing for lots of reasons. But the taxes are too high. \nWe have the highest \u2013 we\u2019re the highest taxed nation in the world. And very importantly, they have trillions \u2013 for companies \u2013 trillions of dollars outside of this country. \nThe Democrats agree it should be brought back in. The Republicans agree it should be brought back in. Everybody agrees it should be brought back in. \nI could sit in a room \u2013 or the Oval Office \u2013 for a period of literally a half hour and I really believe I could get everybody \u2013 every single \u2013 you know, it\u2019s one thing. They don\u2019t agree on health care or they don\u2019t agree on Common Core or they don\u2019t agree on other things and they\u2019ll fight. \nHere\u2019s something every single \u2013 I mean, almost everybody \u2013 agrees. \nThese trillions and trillions of dollars should be brought into the country. The president can\u2019t make a deal. The reason is he doesn\u2019t know how to make a deal. Probably doesn\u2019t work at it. Probably doesn\u2019t care. But you\u2019re talking about tremendous numbers of \u2013 tremendous amounts of money. \nSo when you have something that everybody wants and you can\u2019t make a deal, there\u2019s something going on that\u2019s really wrong. And what it means is you have the wrong leader. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \n...Certainly being very nice to me tonight. I mean, you know, they\u2019re being very strong. They\u2019re declaring Marco Rubio the big loser of the night, which is true. He didn\u2019t win anything. He hasn\u2019t won anything period. \nAnd by the way, I have to tell you and he was very, very nasty. I\u2019ve never heard a person get up and speak in an evening like this and be so nasty but he\u2019s got a right to be nasty because he hasn\u2019t won anything and he\u2019s not going to win very much. \nBut I do congratulate Ted because I know how hard Ted worked on Texas, and that\u2019s a big get. \nNow, I also did very well in Texas; I came in second. And one of the things my son, Eric, told me which I didn\u2019t even realize is that not only did I win most of the states \u2013 some are coming in and I\u2019m expected to win in them but I came in second. I came in second. I came in no worse than second. \nSo it wasn\u2019t like I won and then I disappeared. The worst I had was a second. So I\u2019m very, very honored by the turnout. Okay?\n... \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nBut let me just explain something. If you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happened, whether you go to South Carolina where I had a huge victory, where we had a tremendous victory in New Hampshire, tremendous in Nevada, you look at what\u2019s happened and tonight of course is the best of all. \nI mean, right now, they\u2019re projecting I guess six. But we could be seven, eight, nine, and major states \u2013 it\u2019s Georgia, Alabama, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Virginia, and you know these are amazing states. And we\u2019re going probably get a lot more. In fact, we\u2019re projected to have some pretty good additional numbers. \nBut I will say this. Look, we have expanded the Republican Party. When you look at what\u2019s happened in South Carolina and you see the kind of numbers that we\u2019ve got in terms of extra people coming in. They came from the Democratic Party or the Democrat Party and they\u2019re Democrats and they\u2019re longtime Democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched. And they were independents. And we\u2019ve actually expanded the party. \nLook at the number of votes we\u2019ve had in that area as an example. \nFour years ago, they had 390,000 or so votes; we doubled it. We\u2019re almost 800,000. \nWhereas the Democrats went down. There\u2019s much less enthusiasm for the Democrats. \nI, look, I am a unifier. I know people are going to find that a little bit hard believe. But believe me, I am a unifier. Once we get all of this finished, I\u2019m going to go after one person \u2013 that\u2019s Hillary Clinton \u2013 on the assumption that she\u2019s allowed to run, which is a big assumption. I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s going to be allowed to run. And I think that\u2019s frankly going to be an easy race. \nYou see the polls. I beat Hillary in many polls. \nI know one thing. I don\u2019t think Marco is going to be able to beat her. I don\u2019t think in all fairness I think Ted\u2019s going to have a very hard time. But Ted at least has a shot because at least he\u2019s won a little bit. \nSo I just tell you this: We are going to be a much finer party. We\u2019re going to be a unified party, I mean, to be honest with you. And we are going to be a much bigger party. And you can see that happening. We\u2019re going to be a much bigger party. Our party is expanding. And all you have to do is take a look at the primary states where I\u2019ve won, and just look where we\u2019ve gone from an X number to a much larger number. That hasn\u2019t happened to the Republican Party in many, many decades. \nSo I think we\u2019re going to be more inclusive. I think we\u2019re going to be more unified. And I think we\u2019re going to be a much bigger party, and I think we\u2019re going to win in November. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd I know a lot of the so-called conservatives they say that\u2019s really \u2013 because I\u2019m a conservative but I\u2019m a common sense conservative. \nBut millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood. But we\u2019re not going to allow and we\u2019re not going to fund as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood. And we understand that, and I\u2019ve said it loud and clear. \nAnd we\u2019ll see what happens. But Planned Parenthood, millions of people \u2013 and I\u2019ve had thousands of letters from women that have been helped. And this wasn\u2019t a set up. This was people writing letters. I\u2019m going to be good for women\u2019s health issues. It\u2019s very important to me. Very important to me. \nAnd maybe that\u2019s not a perfect conservative view. But I can one thing. I\u2019m more conservative than anybody on the military, on taking care of our vets, on the border, on the wall, on getting rid of Obamacare and coming up with something much, much better and certainly getting rid of Common Core and getting education to a local level so that you\u2019re going to have good education for our children who are being absolutely starved for proper education. \n...You can call it what you want but I am a truth teller and I will tell the truth. Okay? \nIf you would have told me on June 16th when I was with my wife Melania and we came down the escalator in Trump Tower and it looked literally, well, literally like this. You have a lot of cameras here tonight. It looked literally like the Academy Awards. I never saw so many cameras in my life. \nAnd it takes courage to run. I\u2019ll tell you what, it takes a lot of courage to run for president. I\u2019ve never done this before. \nI\u2019ve been a job producer. I\u2019ve done a lot of things. But this is something I\u2019ve never done. \nBut I felt we had to do it. \nWhen you look at the incompetence of the Iran deal where we give $150 billion and we get absolutely nothing. \nWhen you look at all of the problems our country has and you look at our military, which is really being depleted, rapidly depleted. We\u2019re going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and nobody, nobody, nobody is going to mess with us, folks. Nobody. \nSo, it\u2019s just an amazing honor to have you with me tonight.  \nRecent articles came out talking about how great a company we built. And now we want to put that same ability into doing something for our nation. \nI mean, our nation is in serious trouble. We\u2019re being killed on trade. Absolutely destroyed. \nChina is just taking advantage of us. I have nothing against China. I have great respect for China. But their leaders are too smart for our leaders. Our leaders don\u2019t have a clue. \nAnd the trade deficit\u2019s at $400 billion and $500 billion are too much. No country can sustain that kind of trade deficit. \nIt won\u2019t be that way for long. We have the greatest business leaders in the world on my team already. And believe me, we\u2019re going to redo those trade deals and it\u2019s going to be thing of beauty. \nYou look at countries like Mexico where they\u2019re killing us on the border. Absolutely destroying us on the border. They\u2019re destroying us in terms of economic development. \nCompanies like Carrier Air Conditioning just moving into Mexico. Ford moving into Mexico. Nabisco closing up shop in Chicago and moving into Mexico. We have to stop it, folks. I know how to stop it. \nWe\u2019re going to create jobs. We\u2019re going to create jobs like you\u2019ve never seen. \nWe\u2019re going to lower taxes. I have a plan that Larry Kudlow and so many others think is the best plan they\u2019ve seen. We\u2019re going to lower taxes substantially for the middle class. \nThe middle class has been forgotten in our country. It really helped and really probably was the predominant factor in making our country into a country that we all love so much and we\u2019re so proud of. But we\u2019ve forgotten the middle class. \nSo we\u2019re going to lower taxes. We\u2019re lowering taxes on business. You look at all the companies that are moving out. When you see Pfizer moving to Ireland and you see so many other companies constantly now they\u2019re leaving. They used to move from New York to Florida. Or they\u2019d move from New Jersey to someplace else, Chris. But now they\u2019re moving from here \u2013 but not that many people are leaving New Jersey. But Chris understands the problem. Fully understands. Now they\u2019re leaving from places they used to move to into other parts of the world. We can\u2019t let that happen. \nWe\u2019ve lost our manufacturing jobs. We\u2019ve lost our manufacturing. Millions and millions of jobs. Thousands and thousands and thousands of plants, manufacturing plants, warehouses. I mean, we are losing so much. We can\u2019t let it happen. \nI tell this story often about a friend of mine who\u2019s in the excavation business, and he always orders Caterpillar. And recently he ordered Komatsu tractors from Japan because they\u2019ve cut the yen \u2013 they\u2019ve devalued the yen to such an extent that it was virtually impossible for Caterpillar to compete. And I don\u2019t want that to happen. That\u2019s not going to happen.  \nThey shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do it. We have tremendous power over everybody because we are really the source. We have great, great power. The problem is we have politicians that truly, truly, truly don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. \nSo we\u2019re going to work really, really hard. I\u2019m so honored by this evening. \nChris, thank you very much. I appreciate it. \nThis has been an amazing evening. Already we\u2019ve won five major states. And it looks like we could win six, seven, or eight or nine. \n...I want to congratulate Ted on the winning of Texas. He worked hard on it. I know how hard he worked actually. So I congratulate Ted Cruz on that win. That was an excellent win. \nWe\u2019ve got to make America great against, folks. We\u2019re going to make it great again. \nAnd you know, I watched Hillary\u2019s speech and she\u2019s talking about wages, and being poor, and everything\u2019s poor and everything\u2019s doing badly but we\u2019re going to make it \u2013 she\u2019s been there for so long. I mean, if she hasn\u2019t straighten it out by now, she\u2019s not going to straighten it out in the next four years. It\u2019s just going to become worse and worse. \nShe wants to make America whole again. And I\u2019m trying to figure out what is that all about. \nMake America great again is going to be much better than making America whole again. \nSo I just want to say that this was an exciting evening. It\u2019s so great to be in Florida. It\u2019s so great to be at Mar-a-Largo with friends and the press and the media and everybody. \nI know it was a very tough night for Marco Rubio. He had a tough night. But he worked hard. He spent a lot of money. He is a lightweight as I\u2019ve said many times before. \nBut you know what? We\u2019re going to go to Florida. We\u2019re going to spend so much time in Florida. We\u2019ve got about a 20 point lead. \nI know that a lot of groups, a lot of the special interests and a lot of the lobbyists and the people that want to have their little senator do exactly as they want, they\u2019re going to put $20 million to $25 million into it over the next two weeks from what just came over the wires. And frankly, I think that\u2019s fine as far as I\u2019m concerned. It\u2019s fine. \nAnd if he wins, they\u2019ll have total control. But he\u2019s not going anywhere anyway. But we\u2019ll see what happens. But we\u2019re going to spend a lot of time in Florida. \nThe Virginia win was just a great win because it\u2019s a place that\u2019s spectacular and a place that we have big investments in as we have in Florida. \nRemember, we have thousands of employees in Florida, all along Miami, Doral and Mar-a-Lago and so many other places, and it\u2019s been an amazing place to invest. It\u2019s been amazing to have so many wonderful employees \u2013 some of whom are here tonight \u2013 really urging us on. \nAnd you know, I have thousands of employees all over the country. Actually, all over the world. But for purposes of tonight, we\u2019ll just say all over the country. \nAnd it\u2019s been just so beautiful to watch this company grow and to watch it grow so strongly.

Unbelievable. \nSo on June 16th when we started this journey, there were 17 candidates. I was told by everybody, \u201cDo not go to Iowa. You could never finish even in the top 10.\u201d \nAnd I said, \u201cBut I have friends in Iowa. I know a lot of people in Iowa. I think they\u2019ll really like me. Let\u2019s give it a shot.\u201d \nThey said, \u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d I said, \u201cI have to do it.\u201d \nAnd we finished second, and I want to tell you something: I\u2019m just honored. I\u2019m really honored. \nAnd I want to congratulate Ted, and I want to congratulate all of the incredible candidates, including Mike Huckabee, who\u2019s become a really good friend of mine. So congratulations to everybody. Congratulations.  \nI want to thank all of the folks that worked with us. We had a great team and we will continue to have a great team. \nAnd we\u2019re just so happy with the way everything worked out. \nAnd most importantly, I have to thank my wife and Lara and Eric and Vanessa and Don. They went out and they were doing speeches. And in fact, Don and Eric, I think you did about six speeches today. So, I just want to thank my family. They have been so amazing and so supportive. \nAnd we\u2019ve had every indication \u2013 we\u2019re going now on \u2013 we have a poll we\u2019re at 28 points ahead. Okay? New Hampshire \u2013 we love New Hampshire. We love South Carolina. \nAnd we\u2019re leaving tonight and tomorrow afternoon we\u2019ll be in New Hampshire and that\u2019ll be something special. It\u2019s going to be a great week and we\u2019re going to be up here next weekend. And I think we\u2019re going to be proclaiming victory, I hope. \nI will say this: I don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to win between Bernie and Hillary. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with Hillary\u2019s got other problems, maybe bigger than the problems she\u2019s got in terms of nominations. \nBut we\u2019ve had so many different indications and polls that we beat her and we beat her easily. And we will go on to get the Republican nomination and we will go on to easily beat Hillary or Bernie or whoever the hell they throw up there. \nIowa, we love you. We thank you. You\u2019re special. We will be back many, many times. In fact, I think I might come here and buy a farm. I love it. Okay? \nThank you! Thank you everybody! Thank you very much!

I love evangelicals. \nAnd I have to tell you, Pastor Jeffress has been so incredible on television and elsewhere. He has been great. \nAnd as you know, Liberty University \u2013 do we love Liberty University? Jerry Falwell, Jr. \u2013 an unbelievable guy and he has been with us and with us from the beginning. I want to thank Jerry and his family. It\u2019s been amazing the relationship. \nSo we won the evangelicals. We won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated; I love the poorly educated. \nWe\u2019re the smartest people. We\u2019re the most loyal people. \nAnd you know what I am really happy about because I\u2019ve been saying it for a long time, 46% of the Hispanics. 46% \u2013 number one with Hispanics.

We have a trade deficit with Mexico. They\u2019ll pay for the wall. They\u2019ll be very happy about it. Believe me, I\u2019ll talk to them. They\u2019ll be very, very thrilled.

I keep telling Steve we have the best hotel in Las Vegas. He\u2019s fighting me all the time but that\u2019s all right. \nBut I just want to say it\u2019s a great state and they have great people. And I was so proud. You know, I went to caucus. I was all over the place tonight. The people are amazing. The enthusiasm \u2013 it was unbelievable to see. The people of this country are absolutely amazing. I love you folks very much. Remember, make America great again. We\u2019re going to do it and it\u2019s going to happen fast. Thank you very much everybody! \nWe love Nevada! We love Nevada! Thank you! Thank you! \nThis is a great place. Thank you. Thank you very much...We will be celebrating for a long time tonight! \nYou know, we weren\u2019t expecting \u2013 a couple of months ago, we weren\u2019t expected to win this one. You know that, right? We weren\u2019t. \nOf course, if you listened to the pundits, we weren\u2019t expected to win too much and now we\u2019re winning, winning, winning the country. \nAnd soon, the country is going to start winning, winning, winning. \nSo I want to thank the volunteers. They\u2019ve been unbelievable. These people they worked like endlessly, endlessly. We\u2019re not going to forget it. \nNow, we\u2019ve had some great numbers coming out of Texas and amazing numbers coming out of Tennessee and Georgia and Arkansas. And then a couple of weeks later, Florida. We love Florida. So we\u2019re going to do very well in Ohio, where we\u2019re beating the governor. That\u2019s good. That\u2019s always nice to be beating the governor. And Michigan and the whole thing. I mean, it\u2019s going to be an amazing two months. \nWe might not even need the two months, folks, to be honest. All right? \nSo tonight, we had 45%, 46% and tomorrow you\u2019ll be hearing, \u201cYou know, if they could just take the other candidates and add them up, and if you could add them up because you know the other candidates amount to 55%, so if they could just add them up\u201d. They keep forgetting that when people drop out, we\u2019re going to get a lot of votes... \nSo I want to begin by thanking my boys. Eric has been all over the place making speeches. He\u2019s getting better than me so I\u2019m a little jealous. And Don went up to Elko and you were all over, right? And he loves the rifle stuff. This is serious rifle. This is serious NRA \u2013 both of them. Both of them. We love the Second Amendment, folks. Nobody loves it more than us. So just remember that. \n...I want to just thank a couple of friends of mine that are here. The owner of this incredible hotel, Mr. and Mrs. Phil Ruffin. Stand up. Great guy. Phil said, \u201cDonald\u201d \u2013 like for the last three months; he\u2019s driving me crazy. He said, \u201cDonald, I want to put $10 million into your campaign.\u201d I said, \u201cPhil, I don\u2019t want your money. I don\u2019t want to do it. I\u2019m self-funding.\u201d \nEvery time I see him \u2013 it\u2019s hard for me to turn down money because that\u2019s not what I\u2019ve done my whole life. I grab and grab and grab. You know, I get greedy. I want money, money, and now \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019re going to do, right? We get greedy, right? Now, we\u2019re going to get greedy for the United States. We\u2019re going to grab, grab, and grab. We\u2019re going to bring in so much money and so much everything. We\u2019re going to make America great again, folks.

No, we won\u2019t do that.\u201d \nI said, \u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d Anyways, it\u2019s sort of a little bit complicated...I bought it. Immediately, I called them back and said, \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d I threw it into a chapter. And they come out with the story \u201cTrump files bankruptcy\u201d. Can you believe it? I negotiated it to hell. What I did to that bank \u2013 ayeyeye. \nThey see me walking down the street and they go \u201cHey, hey, hey.\u201d But then I\u2019m good at that stuff, you know? I\u2019m really good at that stuff. \nBut you have to use the laws to your advantage. No, no, you have to use it to your advantage. \nAtlantic City. You know, you look at Atlantic City. Caesar\u2019s went bankrupt. Whoever heard of Caesar\u2019s? Caesar\u2019s filed Chapter 11. Nobody cares. Everybody in Atlantic City. I had the good sense seven years ago and actually the financial media gives me great credit because I have a vision for things. \nI said, \u201cDon\u2019t go into Iraq\u201d even though I\u2019m a very militaristic person. I said \u201cDon\u2019t go into Iraq\u201d and they shouldn\u2019t have because I said you\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East. So what did we get \u2013 $2 trillion. Thousands of deaths. Thousands. Like 5,000. Wounded warriors who I love all over the place. \nWe can\u2019t even go there. Iran is taking over Iraq. With the money that we\u2019re giving them, they\u2019re going to take off and they\u2019re going to get the oil, they\u2019re going to get everything. The oil they don\u2019t get ISIS is getting. What do we get? Nothing. We get nothing. We got far less than nothing. \nSo I had vision in 2004 \u2013 Reuters \u2013 actually it was before that but they wrote a story. Trump says don\u2019t do Iraq. \nNow, I\u2019m much more militaristic than Bush, even the brother. But you got to know where to use it and when. You got to use. \nSo with Atlantic City, seven years ago, I got out. That\u2019s called vision. I should get credit for vision. \nAnd again, this isn\u2019t bragging. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t say this but I need your fricking votes. Do you understand that? Do you understand that? \nI mean, normally I wouldn\u2019t. So I got great credit. I got out. \nBut most of the places in Atlantic City are either in trouble or they\u2019re bankrupt. They went bankrupt. \nBut I made a lot of money in Atlantic City. I had a great time in Atlantic City but they asked me a nasty question, I gave a great answer. I thought. So I think I solved it. \nListen, we are going to do things that are going to make you so proud if I win. \nWe are going to have victories again. We are going to win. \nIn fact, last night in front of the audience and I\u2019ve never said this before. Last night in front of the audience I said we\u2019re going to have so many victories. \nAnd then I said we\u2019re going to win here. We\u2019re going to win on trade. \nWe\u2019re going to win militarily in terms of not having wars but just having such great strength that nobody\u2019s going to play with us. Nobody\u2019s going to mess with us. Okay? Nobody. \nAnd we\u2019re going to have victories. So many victories that are going to be coming out...In fact, you might get tired of victories. You may not want anymore...And everyone stood up and said \u201cNo, no, no, we want to keep winning.\u201d \nIf I win, we will have victories all over. We will win on trade. We will win on health care. We will win on everything. \nI will protect your Social Security without cuts. I will protect your Medicare and your Medicaid. We are going to have something that\u2019s so special. \nAnd you know, my whole fame is and I\u2019ll say it once. We will make America truly great again. \nAnd thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much! \nWe can\u2019t make our country great if we\u2019re going to be poor. We\u2019re a debtor nation. We owe $19 trillion. \nChina \u2013 think of this \u2013 China we owe $1.4 trillion to. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, they take our base, they take our manufacturing and we owe them $1.4 trillion. How do you do that? That\u2019s like a magic act. Right? It\u2019s true. \nJapan sells us cars by the millions. They make a fortune. They come in, they sell us cars by the millions. And we owe them the exact same amount. We owe them $1.4 trillion. How come if they\u2019re selling us cars we owe them money? Think of it. Put on your business. See? I have a natural instinct for this stuff. Right? You know? Right? \nIf we buy all these cars, why do we owe them money? But we owe them because they take all our money that they make and they buy our bonds. And we\u2019re paying interests on them and we owe them money. \nSo, it\u2019ll change. It can change. It\u2019s not even going to be hard. \nPeople don\u2019t realize. See, Obama never read the Art of the Deal. People don\u2019t realize. \nOh, and somebody said Sharon. It was Sharon. Where\u2019s Sharon? She gave me such a hard time. Where\u2019s Sharon? Where the hell is she? You could have both Sharons stand up actually. Where are they? Both of them. Sharon is great. Oh, did they go after her...She took a lot of incoming. Sharon, did you take a lot of incoming? I think so. Right? Thank you, darling. \nSo, we are going to do something that if I get elected \u2013 and again they said I\u2019ll never run and now...One guy said \u2013 John McLaughlin \u2013 you ever watch the McLaughlin Report? I like him. \nAnd one of the people on the little group said Donald Trump is a great businessman but he\u2019ll never make it as a President. He\u2019ll never get elected. He\u2019ll never make it. And John McLaughlin \u2013 this crusty guy who I like; I don\u2019t know him. I never met him, I don\u2019t think. But I like. He\u2019s sitting there and he goes \u2013 and he got angry \u2013 he goes \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he make it? You tell me why. He\u2019s been a tremendous success in everything he\u2019s done. I go all over the world. I see him name. I see his name all over. He\u2019s a great success.\u201d \nAnd he said \u2013 I think this is the word \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s a man of great achievement. Why wouldn\u2019t he make it?\u201d \nAnd I thought it was so nice and the other guy just sort of shut up. You know, because you need somebody of great achievement. \nYou need \u2013 I\u2019ve produced tens of thousands of jobs over the year. I don\u2019t have to worry about Obamacare. I take such good care of my employees. I have thousands of employees. I take good care of them. We have great plans. My employees are lucky. They hit the lotto, okay? But I take great care \u2013 education and health care \u2013 and my people are very happy. \nBut I\u2019ve done this for a long time, and I\u2019ve seen ups and downs. I\u2019ve seen market crashes. I\u2019ve seen friends of mine go bankrupt. You\u2019ve never seen \u2013 I\u2019ve never gone bankrupt. By the way, I\u2019ve used the laws to my advantage and companies. \nI buy a company. I throw it into a chapter. I negotiate with banks. I kill. You know. And then they say \u201cTrump goes bankrupt.\u201d These people \u2013 they don\u2019t have any \u2013 \nAnd we\u2019re going to build a wall and we\u2019re going to get, you know, the gang members in Baltimore and in Chicago and these are some tough dudes. They\u2019re going to be out so fast. \nOne of the first thing I\u2019m going to do is get rid of those gang members. We\u2019re going to be \u2013 you know, you look at what\u2019s going on with Baltimore, you look at what\u2019s going on in Chicago and Ferguson and St. Louis the other night. We are going to get rid of those gang members so fast your head will spin. \nYou know, we can be very tough. I just met your cops outside. Those police are tough cookies. Those guys \u2013 we need law and order. We need law and order. \nI mean, they allowed \u2013 in one night, that first night in Baltimore \u2013 they allowed that city to be destroyed. And they set it back 35 years. One night. Because the police were not allowed to protect people. They weren\u2019t allowed to protect people. \nWe have incredible law enforcement in this country and we have to be \u2013 the head of the police in Chicago is a person I know. Originally from New York. He\u2019s a phenomenal guy. He can stop things if they\u2019re allowed to stop them. He can stop it. Believe me. \nWe have some incredible people. But we have to be tough. We have to be smart. \nYou know, I know you\u2019re going to have some bad apples. You\u2019re going to have problems. I see some of the things. You did too and it\u2019s disgusting and it\u2019s horrible. But that\u2019s such a tiny percentage. \nThe problem is the good work doesn\u2019t get shown on television. All of the good work, which is 99.9%. \nI mean, the good work with the police. It\u2019s 99.9%. That one little thing. \nAnd it\u2019s horrible. I agree. I hated some of the things. I don\u2019t have to go into them. But you know the same ones because you were sick when you looked at some of them just like I was. \nBut we need law and order. We need our police. They\u2019re great people. They do a phenomenal job. They\u2019re right now afraid of doing anything. They\u2019re afraid. \nI mean, I know cities. I won\u2019t mention names but I know cities where police are afraid to even talk to people because they want to be able to retire and have their pension; they don\u2019t want to be thrown off the police force. \nAnd then you wonder why there\u2019s crimes in our cities. \nSo we need a whole new mindset. We have to build up our military. We have to make our military so strong. We have to make our military so powerful and so strong that we never have to use it. We never have to use it. \nWe also have to focus on what we have \u2013 look, Ukraine. I want Ukraine to be healthy, vibrant and good. But Ukraine is near Germany and all of these European countries. We\u2019re now sending F-22s. That\u2019s the newest fighters. The best in the world. We\u2019re sending fighters every \u2013 Where\u2019s Germany? Where are all these European countries? It affects them. It affects them. And we want to stand alongside of them. I agree. \nBut why are we leading the fight? Putin hates us. He hates Obama. He doesn\u2019t hate us. I think he\u2019d like me. I\u2019d get along great with him I think if you want to know the truth. No, he has no respect for our President and our President doesn\u2019t like him in all fairness. They don\u2019t have good chemistry to put it mildly, would you say. But I\u2019d get along with these people. \nThink of it. Every country is ripping us off. Even Russia is ripping us off because in the Iran deal, which is going to go down as one of the worst deals ever, Russia is a big beneficiary because they\u2019re going to sell Iran missiles with the money we give to Iran. Think of that. \nSo one of the biggest beneficiaries is Russia. Okay? \nBut think of it. So, Ukraine \u2013 let\u2019s take a few of these things and then I\u2019m getting the hell out of here; I\u2019m going back to New York. Do you mind? Maybe I\u2019ll go to the Grand Ole Opry tonight. Can I do that? \nI\u2019d actually rather \u2013 I love \u2013 by the way, this is not a politician speaking. Believe me. I hope. I love country music. I love it. Hey, Trace Adkins \u2013 right? And who else won on The Apprentice? Who else? John Rich. My kids love those two guys. John Rich. And who else? Who did really well? Clint Black. Right? Clint Black. He did great. And my Trace \u2013 how good is Trace, okay? \nYou know, Trace came onto The Apprentice. And I said, \u201cWho the hell is he? Who is he?\u201d I didn\u2019t know who Trace was. I\u2019d never heard of him. And he wasn\u2019t a big name. And he came on \u2013 just to show you how important this show is and his record or album or whatever you call it now...it went to number one. And then he came to me the next year...but Trace came to me and he goes \u2013 you know, at certain awards show, I won\u2019t mention the name \u2013 but he said \u201cLast year, I couldn\u2019t get into the show and this year I\u2019m hosting it, Mr. Trump, all because of you.\u201d \nNice, right? I know, nice. \nBut those three guys, they\u2019re great and they\u2019re just fantastic people. \nBut we\u2019ve got to make our country so strong. We have to make our country rich again. \nA person came up and said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s not nice.\u201d What\u2019s not nice? They said rich, you know, to say we\u2019re going to make our country rich. \nSo, I\u2019m on the front page of the New York Times. I can\u2019t even talk about it. I\u2019m embarrassed to talk about it. \nBut they also said, I was essentially screaming at this guy from Univision, who I happen to be suing for $500 million. They didn\u2019t mention that. \nThey also didn\u2019t mention that his daughter works for Hillary Clinton. Did you know that? His daughter works for Hillary Clinton. Oh, you didn\u2019t know that. Oh. No, they didn\u2019t mention that. No, no. \nThey said I was wearing a toupee and I was screaming but they didn\u2019t. No, he\u2019s screaming at me. \nSo we very nicely \u2013 and then we let him come back and we actually had a nice talk. He actually seemed like a nice guy after he calmed down a little bit. You know, he\u2019s a very emotional man. \nBut, he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t build a wall because you can\u2019t do it.\u201d \nSo, 2,000 years ago in China \u2013 we always get back to China \u2013 2,000 years ago, the Great Wall of China \u2013 oh, we\u2019d like to have a wall. This is a serious wall. Okay? This is a wall you don\u2019t go through so easy. \nThey built a wall 2,000 years ago that\u2019s 13,000 miles. Think of that. That\u2019s a big wall. That\u2019s serious wall, right? This was 2,000 years ago. I mean, it took them like 500 years to build it so you know, I got to be a little bit \u2013 you know, took a long time. But 13,000 miles that\u2019s a long time. They had no tractors. They didn\u2019t have Caterpillars. \nOf course, today, we use Komatsus because they\u2019re made in Japan and you could buy them cheaper. How stupid is that? Because they devalued the yen so much and people are buying Komatsus instead of Caterpillars. Caterpillar\u2019s stock is down. It\u2019s terrible. We\u2019ll change that around. Believe me. Believe me. \nBut, they build this wall. Now, we have really 15 \u2013 I would say \u2013 look we have 2,000 miles as opposed to 13,000. But you don\u2019t need it on all of it because some you have natural landscaping, some you have a lot of places. \nAnd actually 10 years ago, everybody wanted the wall built. Hillary wanted it built. But they couldn\u2019t. \nBecause I\u2019m a great builder. What I do best is build. I\u2019m not a rendering guy. I do the building and then do the rendering. A lot of these guys come in with renderings and it never gets built. Does that make sense to anybody? I\u2019m the opposite. I get it built. \nSo, one of the reasons it couldn\u2019t get built is because they couldn\u2019t get an approved environmental impact study. Do you believe this? No, no, they had certain snail doggers and different things. They couldn\u2019t get it. They could not get an environmental impact study approved to build a wall. \nAnd they\u2019re killing people. We have illegal immigrants. You see that with Kate in San Francisco. You see it with Jamiel. You see it with so many people. \nLast night in Massachusetts I met some unbelievable families that have been devastated by illegal immigrants. They come into this country and kill members of their family. \nLast week in California, a 66-year-old veteran \u2013 a female, a veteran, 66 \u2013 got raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed. Raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed. 66-years-old. By an illegal immigrant that they caught, that they caught luckily. \nBut this is what we have. We have stupid people in our government and we have people pouring across the border. And you know what? We have great border patrol people. I went there. You probably saw that. That\u2019s why the hat is so successful. The white one, right? \nBut I went there, everybody wants to buy the hat. Now they like the white one. Then two weeks later, I wore the red one. The white one didn\u2019t sell so well. The red one sells. Crazy thing. \nBut I went to the border and I got to know the people and I saw people, and you know it\u2019s rough stuff, it\u2019s rough stuff. \nAnd when I first came in and when I first did my opening statement that I was running for President, I talked about illegal immigration. I was killed by the press. \nRush Limbaugh, who I think is a terrific guy, said \u201cTrump has received more incoming than any human being I\u2019ve ever seen. Then he goes and has a news conference and I think he\u2019s going to apologize and he doubles down.\u201d \nI got credit. I got credit. \nNo, they thought I was going to apologize. And I don\u2019t mind apologizing but I have to make a mistake to apologize and I was right. No, I was right. \nSo for two weeks, as Rush said, I took incoming...In fact that was my first two weeks. I said \u201cIs it going to be like this for the next year and a half?\u201d I don\u2019t know if I can make it. It was brutal. \nNow, many of those people that talked that way, many of those people, they\u2019ve apologized to me. Everybody says I\u2019m right. And only because of me is everybody talking about illegal immigration. They wouldn\u2019t even be talking about it. They wouldn\u2019t even be talking about it.  \nYou know, people talk about the Tea Party and you talk about marginalizing, at least I have a microphone where I can fight back. You people don\u2019t. \nThe Tea Party people are incredible people. These are people that work hard and they love the country and then they just get beat up all the time by the media. It\u2019s disgusting. \nAnd you will be surprised how big you are. You don\u2019t know how big you are. You don\u2019t know the power that you have. I mean it. You don\u2019t know the power that you have. \nThe Tea Party and you can call it anything that you want. I don\u2019t care about names. But the Tea Party has tremendous power. \nI talked silent majority. But the silent majority is more than Tea Party. It\u2019s Democrats. It\u2019s poor people. It\u2019s rich people. It\u2019s everybody. It\u2019s evangelicals. \nOne of the things that made me so happy \u2013 I\u2019m a protestant. I\u2019m a presbyterian. Right? \u2013 is that I had a recent poll and they did a beautiful \u2013 like these polls are great. You know, guys like Jeb Bush and Hillary, they hire pollsters. They pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars. What do you have to do that for? Every week they come out with a new poll. Right? \nHey, I\u2019m rich. I could hire a hundred poll. I don\u2019t want to waste money. You know, why should I pay? \nI know in one case...like $150,000 a month. And you know, then they\u2019re arrogant guys. They think they\u2019re hot stuff and they tell the candidates what to say. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to say this. You\u2019ve got to be politically correct.\u201d \nNo way. I don\u2019t have time to be political. No, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. \nI don\u2019t have time to be political. You know, it takes a lot of time to be politically correct. \nYou saw the anchor baby thing. Did you see that with where I\u2019m on? And somebody from...it\u2019s the same network \u2013 CNN again \u2013 he said, \u201cYou know the name anchor baby is very insulting?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat would you call it?\u201d And he gave me like nine words. \u201cA baby of illegal immigrant who was brought to the country to this and that.\u201d I said, \u201cHow can I say that? It\u2019s too long.\u201d \nIt\u2019s anchor baby. \nAnd then Bush \u2013 Jeb. Jeb Bush gets caught because he is such a nice person. Honestly. \nIf you want a nice person, honestly you should vote for Jeb. The country is going to go to hell but we won\u2019t talk of that. No, no, but if you want a nice person. \nSo Jeb has a memo that he signed of basically a politically correct memo. You know, don\u2019t say this, don\u2019t say that. All these things. Pages of stuff. \nBut one of the things \u2013 \u201cNever use the term \u2018anchor baby\u2019.\u201d \nSo all of a sudden, he\u2019s using the term anchor baby just last week. \nAnd with me, when I use it nobody criticizes me. They expect me. They gave up. Okay? \nWith him, they killed him. They just killed him. It didn\u2019t stop. \nAnd then he blamed it on the Asians. He said, you know \u2013 did you see that? And then the New York Times did an editorial \u201cHow dare you attack the Asians?\u201d \nSo he wanted to steer away from the Hispanics. He said, \u201cWell, you know, the Asians come in and they also have anchor babies.\u201d And now the Asians all hate him. It\u2019s true. \nBut the Asians love me and I love them. I love them. \nSo he has a memo and he signs the memo and it says \u2013 a couple of years ago \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t use this term\u201d, and now he\u2019s using it because he has to. \nBecause baby \u2013 you know, think of it. Think of it. I want to build a wall. Okay? So easy. So easy. When this clown \u2013 Jose Reyes or whatever the hell his name \u2013 no, he\u2019s a baseball player. Ramos. Actually Jose Reyes is a baseball player. He\u2019s a nice baseball player. But when Ramos got up the other day screaming and ranting and going crazy and I had all these reporters. Actually, the reporters were mostly on my side because they all had their hand up but this guy starts screaming. \nSo I even had liberal people from CBS \u2013 I actually said to the CBS guy \u201cYes?\u201d and this guy stands up and starts screaming. \nSo when he \u2013 and I actually got a lot of credit for the way we handled him. I didn\u2019t do anything like \u2013 I didn\u2019t do anything. Except for the Times. And that\u2019s what I alluded to before. The Times said, \u201cDonald Trump railed at him and screamed at him.\u201d I didn\u2019t scream at him. But he was screaming at me. \nAnd much worse than that, they said I wore a toupee. Can you believe it? I don\u2019t wear a toupee, and I proved it \u2013 I won\u2019t bring anybody up. I won\u2019t bring anybody up. But I don\u2019t. \nBut think of it. I\u2019m in the front page of the New York Times and in the first sentence in the first paragraph has this announcer \u2013 this Hispanic announcer that nobody ever heard of \u2013 saying they called him something which means he wears a toupee. And I don\u2019t. \nSo it says \u201c$50 million or more\u201d, I go 50. So they\u2019ll take $50 million for a building that might be worth a billion and honestly much more. \nAnd they add them up and they say \u201cWell, he\u2019s worth $2.9 billion.\u201d It\u2019s really \u2013 this is the press. And they have no clue. Those statements aren\u2019t really meant for me \u2013 it\u2019s not meant for a guy like me. \nBut with all of that the statements were so good. They\u2019re so good. They\u2019re so good. \nAnd you know, one of the things I\u2019m doing and last night was incredible. We had an amazing event in Massachusetts. Right? Oh, look at this, we have a wit- what the hell are you doing in Nashville? What are you doing? \n...Anyway, so here I am. I spent millions of dollars during the course on jet fuel. Okay? Like a lot of money on jets. \nBut somebody puts up a sign $100 to go to this thing. I didn\u2019t know who did it. But somebody puts up a sign. \nSo all over the place, I\u2019m spending millions of dollars. I\u2019m turning down millions. I don\u2019t want your money. I don\u2019t want your money. \nSomebody puts a sign up talking about $100 contribution, which you didn\u2019t have to make. But they put it up. It\u2019s all over CNN. \u201cTrump is asking for $100.\u201d \nI fly my plane some place it costs me a fortune. The fuel. The $100. The money that I raised last night, which says it all it goes towards paying off like the expense or something. The guy that had it is a great guy \u2013 Ernie. A great guy. Really successful guy. You know him, right? Ernie. He\u2019ll sell you a car any day of the week, right? \nAnd you know the guy is \u2013 like 2,000 people showed up. Let him get a little deferment of the roast beef or whatever the hell they\u2019re serving. \nSo they put up a sign. I don\u2019t want the money. I might like $4 or $5 million. That\u2019s hard to turn down. But the hundred dollars times some people and we let the vets there, we let most of the people I think came in free. And I end up with this big story \u2013 \u201cTrump accepting contributions\u201d. \nI can\u2019t believe it. I got so angry at my people. Because somebody put up a sign saying $100. And honestly, first of all, it\u2019s like peanuts. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. But they used to it to try and marginalize. They always do. They always do. \nThe bottom line is I am self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m self-funding. I don\u2019t want to have anybody giving. I don\u2019t need money. Now, with that being said, the small money comes in and it\u2019s not a lot of money but it\u2019s great money. Like Beada might send me some money. Beada will send me some money. \nBut a woman sent me $7 with a beautiful letter from Georgia. Another person sent me $12. Small money. And some sent me $1,000. But it doesn\u2019t amount to a lot. But that I do like coming in because they invest in the campaign. \nHow do I take the $7 check, right, and send it back to the person who sent it to me from Georgia? \u201cDear So and So, I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t really want your money.\u201d How do you write a letter like that? \nI want them to invest in it. You know, but they\u2019re not going to tell me not to do this or not to do that for China because they are lobbyists for China and they gave me $5 million. \nI had a big lobbyist asked me to have \u2013 he wanted to give me $5 million for my campaign. I turned him down. I turned him down. \nAnd then I see this story on CNN last night. It was disgusting. That look there\u2019s a sign \u2013 $100! Somebody does a sign. It actually was a beautiful sign if you want to know the truth. It was so beautiful. It was beautifully done. And they\u2019re doing this big thing about all day long last night about \u2013 I said we had this incredible event and they destroyed it by trying to marginalize. And that\u2019s the press. That\u2019s the media. \nYeah, the criminal media. I mean, there\u2019s truth to it. No, because a lot of times they know it\u2019s wrong. \nBut I just want to tell you so important to me and last night it was such an incredible event. It had to be a record for a house. The guy got a beautiful house, got a big lawn, put up a tent. But we had 2,000 people. It had to be a record. \nThe spirit in that group, the spirit in Alabama, the spirit was so incredible. The spirit in our last meeting in Iowa. Don\u2019t forget. \nWhen I went to Iowa and you know what I love? I\u2019m leading with Tea Party. Big. I love Tea Party. I love the Tea Party. Tea Party people, stand up and take a bow. You have not been treated fairly. No, you haven\u2019t been treated fairly. \nYou have not been treated fairly. \nI\u2019ve got the greatest deal makers in the world lined up to make deals for us. Carl Icahn \u2013 incredible guy. Right? Incredible guy. Great deal maker. \nI\u2019ve got some of the greatest deal makers in the world. They\u2019re all calling me too. They said \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me.\u201d \nI have these guys calling me up \u2013 the best in the world. \nNow, I know the best. I also know guys that are overrated. I know guys that you haven\u2019t heard of that honestly are phenomenal. I know a lot that you have heard of that aren\u2019t really that good, that are overrated in my opinion. \nBut they\u2019re the best in the world. And they\u2019re calling me. They don\u2019t want money. They\u2019re worth billions of dollars. \nBut when I put, let\u2019s say, Carl Icahn and I\u2019ll say \u201cCarl, do me a favor. Handle China.\u201d We\u2019re going to make a great deal. No, no, we\u2019re going to make a great deal because that\u2019s what happens. You know, that\u2019s what happens. \nSo, we\u2019re going to take back our trade. \nIf you look at China, if you look at Japan \u2013 I was in Los Angeles a few weeks ago. I saw ships \u2013 the biggest ships I\u2019ve ever seen with cars pouring our, pouring out one after another, made in Japan, very nice. Everything\u2019s nice. Except that it doesn\u2019t help us. When does it help us? When does it help us? \nWe sell them beef. Beef. And then they don\u2019t want it. Because you know, do you ever see what\u2019s going on over there? We sell the beef and it goes over there and it\u2019s very perishable. So by the time it gets over there, then they turn it over \u201cWe don\u2019t want it.\u201d \nThey have cars coming from these massive, massive ships. Massive. And they just pour off the ships. \nAnd I say, \u201cWhat are we doing? How stupid are we? No tax, no nothing.\u201d \nAnd I\u2019m a free trader. I believe in free trade. I have to say. But I have to be fair trade. \nWhen you look at Japan, they take in money up here and we give them money down here. We get nothing by comparison. It\u2019s like peanuts. \nBalance it out, fellows. Balance it out. Got to balance it. \nA friend of mine is a great manufacturer. As you know, China has \u2013 it\u2019s probably the greatest theft in the history of the United States what China has done to us. They\u2019ve taken our money. They\u2019ve taken our jobs. They\u2019ve taken everything. They\u2019ve taken so much. \nAnd they\u2019re creating a bubble and you know interestingly we\u2019re so intertwined that now the bubble could take us down if it explodes, which at some point it might. \nAnd we\u2019ve got to be smart. \nI made so much money dealing with China. I made hundreds of millions, probably billions, dealing with China. \nThe Bank of America building in San Francisco \u2013 I own a big chunk of that, which nobody knows. Nobody knows. \nYou know, all these guys come to Forbes. \u201cOh, Trump\u2019s worth only $5 billion or $4 billion.\u201d Or whatever. \u201cHe\u2019s only worth $5 billion.\u201d It\u2019s like a bankrupt magazine...They don\u2019t even know my numbers. They said, \u201cWell, we haven\u2019t been able to look at about 400 of his companies.\u201d \nSo I filed. Interestingly, they said \u201cHe\u2019ll never run. He\u2019ll never run.\u201d \n...Then I announced. Then they said, \u201cOh, he\u2019ll never file his form whatever.\u201d That\u2019s a single page where basically you\u2019re signing your life away and it has to be done within 14 days of the announcement. \nI signed my form. And they said, \u201cWell, he\u2019ll never ever put in his financials.\u201d And you have like 90 days or something. And they said, \u201cHe\u2019ll ask for extensions but he\u2019ll never show because he\u2019s probably not as rich as people think.\u201d \nBut actually I\u2019m much richer and I put in my financials \u2013 it\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. \nAnd Forbes and another group said, \u201cNo, no, we don\u2019t know what these companies are.\u201d \nI put in these massive financials, and you know, I was so proud. I might have filed if I wasn\u2019t going to run. I wanted to show people. I wanted to brag. It\u2019s such a great company I\u2019ve built. \nSo they said, \u201cHe\u2019ll never put in his financials.\u201d I put in the financials. And everybody \u2013 they\u2019re much bigger. It\u2019s a much bigger \u2013 you know, very little debt, tremendous value. And really great assets. Iconic assets. You know, iconic. Doral, Turnberry in Scotland. I mean, I have some of the greatest real estates in the world. And I\u2019m very proud of it. \nBut they say, \u201cHe\u2019ll never file. He\u2019ll never file.\u201d \nThen they see all these companies. And you know, they have boxes. And because it wasn\u2019t really meant for somebody like me, and they have these little boxes. They say, \u201cIs it worth or does he make $1 million, from $1 million to $5 million, from $5 million to $10 million, from $10 million to $20 million?\u201d The last box is $50 million or more. $50 million or more. \nSo like I have a lot of buildings that are worth much more than that. I have a lot of assets that are worth much more than that. \nSo it says \u201c$50 million or more\u201d. So I checked many of them. I don\u2019t know how many. I think there\u2019s 23 of them. Can you believe it? So I checked like, I don\u2019t know, I think it\u2019s 23. I could be wrong. Oh, they\u2019ll kill me if I\u2019m wrong. But I\u2019m not sure. But I think it\u2019s like 23 boxes. $50 million or more. \nSo you know when some of these guys do to try and always marginalize you? They added up 23 50s. Now, some of the 50s are worth a billion. Some of them are worth more than a billion. \nWe can save our country. We can save our country. \nSo anyways, the bottom line, NBC renewed it. I told them I\u2019m not doing it, and then they finally believed me when I actually announced. \nThey don\u2019t like me anymore. It\u2019s amazing. They do not like me. \nBut it\u2019s too bad. Too bad. Well, thank you. \nYou know, the funny thing about The Apprentice \u2013 there have been 15 copies of The Apprentice. Every single one of them failed. So then a reporter said to me, \u201cWhy do you think that is?\u201d I said \u201cBecause I\u2019m special.\u201d And I was kidding. I was doing it sarcastically \u2013 I mean, I sort of meant it to be honest, right? But I was sort of kidding. And they wrote it and I hated the way it looked in writing. You know, it sounds good when you say it but oh it looks so bad in writing. \nBut so I had a great experience. So here I am \u2013 great schools, great brain, great success, built a great company, do The Apprentice, tremendous success. When I did The Apprentice, a certain critic said \u201cIt will never be successful\u201d because you know to have a big hit \u2013 a really a number one hit \u2013 you have to \u2013 and you remember that first season it had one of the highest ratings ever. The finale of The Apprentice? Aye! Remember with the great Bill Rancic. Remember how that was? Incredible. But to have a great success, you have to have women. \nAnd I\u2019ll never forget \u2013 I saved the article. Right? Like Harry Truman saved it where it said, \u201cTruman loses\u201d and he actually won. Remember? But I saved this article. They said \u201cTrump can never succeed on television because why would women want to watch Donald Trump?\u201d And I said, \u201cAm I so bad? Am I so bad?\u201d Tell me, am I so bad? \nAnd it turned out that women were the biggest base. I mean, those were the ones that liked...So you know I saved those things. \nBut no matter how you cut it, we can do something so incredible. And honestly, it\u2019s going to be hard. It\u2019s going to be a lot of work. It\u2019s going to be a lot of time. I wouldn\u2019t leave the White House. You know, Obama always leaves the White House. Think of it. You\u2019re elected President. You\u2019re in the White House. Why would you want to leave? I think I\u2019d maybe never leave! How cool is that? \nHe leaves to go to some place and go fundraisers. I\u2019ll try \u2013 I don\u2019t know maybe there\u2019s some rules against it. So maybe I can\u2019t. But I\u2019ll do the fundraisers in the White House. \nHe and his wife left \u2013 I think one was doing the Ellen show another was doing another show right next door in Burbank, California. They left a couple of hours difference. One took Air Force One; one took a beautiful Boeing 757. Two planes. A little bit different timing going to the same location, going to the same airport to do different shows. \nAnd I say why? Why aren\u2019t they flying at least the same plane? \nNow, I know what those suckers cost because I happen to have one of them right? So I know what it costs to operate these planes...More importantly, the time and the energy. But I would have said Ellen or I would have said whoever was doing the show, \u201cLet\u2019s do it from the White House.\u201d This way, I take a half and hour, I go back, I don\u2019t spend any money of the taxpayers. \n...And you know the funny thing is that whoever the host is would like it better. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our show live from the White House or something\u201d. \nSo we don\u2019t pay any money. We don\u2019t have to fuel up Air Force One, which costs you \u2013 do you ever see what it costs to travel in these things?  With hundreds and hundreds of security and you\u2019re closing down Burbank, California. \nI mean, every time Obama comes to Manhattan to do a fundraiser, which is often, I say \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You can\u2019t move. They closed down all the streets. They closed down the city.\u201d \nAnd he could do it from like Washington. In fact, he could do it in my new hotel that I\u2019m buying which is only a couple of blocks. \n...It\u2019s true. I\u2019m building this incredible hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue and it\u2019s going to be incredible. The Old Post Office. And I actually got it from the Obama administration, which is hard to believe. People say \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? How did Trump get it?\u201d \nOne of the most heavily sought after buildings in the history of the General Services Administration, which owned it. You know, they\u2019re the ones that made the decision. And I got it and we\u2019re building this phenomenal hotel \u2013 Trump International Hotel \u2013 right on Pennsylvania Avenue directly between Congress and the White House. Right? It\u2019s going to open just in time \u2013 and by the way, listen to this one. We\u2019re under budget and ahead of schedule. Do you ever hear that from government? Way under budget. \nSo we\u2019re actually going to be opening and it\u2019ll be great. But he can use my hotel. I\u2019ll let him use it free. You just come in, use it, go back to the White House. But you don\u2019t have to do that. \nBut you\u2019d say to yourself why \u2013 you know, it\u2019s a mindset. But more importantly even in the travel, we have so many things that we have to do to straighten out our country. You don\u2019t want to waste time. You\u2019ve got to do this. You\u2019ve got to make deals. \nYou saw the Quinnipiac just came out and that was an amazing poll. I was the same thing. Much, much higher \u2013 double and triple and quadruple many of these candidates. \nAnd the reason is people in this country are smart. They don\u2019t believe a lot of what they see in the media because if you believe these people \u2013 you know, why are they doing this? I mean, why are they even saying it? \nYou\u2019d think that if somebody\u2019s good for the country \u2013 and I\u2019ll be great for the country because I\u2019m going to make great deals for our country. We don\u2019t win anymore. Our country doesn\u2019t win anymore. \nYou\u2019d think somebody \u2013 even a liberal person or a Democrat liberal and I mean, really liberal. Somebody who\u2019s going to make the country \u2013 why are they knocking it? Why are they knocking? Why do they fight? \nYou\u2019d think they\u2019d say \u201cLet\u2019s do it. It\u2019s good. It\u2019s good for all of us.\u201d \nBecause our country is in trouble. We owe now $19 trillion. You know, I\u2019ve been saying $18 [trillion] for a while now. But now it starts to go up quickly. \nAnd by the way, when Obamacare kicks in, which is really kicking in in \u201916, you want to see bad deficits? You want to see it go up? You\u2019re going to really see it go up because that has a huge negative impact not only on jobs but on the deficit itself because of the costs. And it\u2019s no good. \nHave you noticed \u2013 and you\u2019ve seen it yourself \u2013 the premiums have gone through the roof? Right? The deductibility \u2013 unless you\u2019re close to death, you\u2019re never going to use it. You can\u2019t use it because the deductibility is so high. \nBut the premiums are up 30%, 40%, and 50% and more. It\u2019s a disaster. \nAnd on top of that, it\u2019s going to cost the country a fortune. So it\u2019s not only costing you a lot of money, it\u2019s going to cost the country a fortune. \nSo we have to do something about it. And we have to do something importantly about it. \nBut when I see the people on television and I have to tell you I won\u2019t mention names, some of them when they hear my name \u2013 I was talking \u2013 we have a great reporter today from the Wall Street Journal with us. Okay? Who came down. And she actually said \u201cSome of them when they hear your name it looks like they\u2019re a boiler waiting to explode.\u201d It\u2019s true. \n...Now, number one, they look bad because they said \u2013 do you remember the beginning? Like three, four months ago. They said, \u201cHe\u2019s a clown. He\u2019s a clown. Just having fun.\u201d \nYou know, I went to a great school. I did great. I did \u2013 everything was great. I came out. I made a fortune, which I want to use the brain for you, but I made a fortune. \nI then did a book called The Art of the Deal and many bestsellers. The Art of the Deal being probably the best selling business book of all time. Who has read The Art of the Deal? Yeah, most people. Most everybody. \nI jokingly say but I mean it \u2013 the Bible tops it by a long way. I say that. I say that. Said it the first time in Iowa. People liked that. But it\u2019s true. Nothing tops the Bible. \nBut the Art of the Deal \u2013 great success. Many books \u2013 bestsellers. Many, many bestsellers. \nThen I do The Apprentice. I\u2019ve never done television. I do The Apprentice. It\u2019s one of the most successful shows ever on television by the way. \nAnd NBC renewed the Apprentice. You know that. Right? For me. \nThey came up to my office, the head of Comcast \u2013 great guy \u2013 I won\u2019t use names. Just say \u201cSteve\u201d. No, honestly he\u2019s a great guy. One of the best in the country. He came up with the heads of NBC six months ago and they said, \u201cDonald, we\u2019re renewing The Apprentice. Please, you\u2019ll have to do \u2013 you have to do it.\u201d \nI said, \u201cHonestly, Steve, I\u2019m running for President. I want to make our country great again. I want to make -\u201c \nAnd they didn\u2019t believe me. And I said it four times. They didn\u2019t believe me. Nobody believed that I was going to run. Nobody. \nMy wife didn\u2019t even believe me, but now she does. But she actually said \u201cIf you actually say you\u2019re going to run, you\u2019re going to do great because people like you.\u201d She actually said \u201cThey\u2019d love you\u201d but I don\u2019t want to brag. But she said, \u201cIf you actually run \u2013 not you may run, you may not run, who knows?\u201d But she said \u201cIf you actually say -\u201c \nSo the NBC guys come up \u2013 terrific people. I mean, honestly I had a great relationship with NBC for 12 years. We had many, many, you know number ones and The Apprentice continues to do great. You know, last season you know how well it did. So they wanted to renew it for many, many shows. \nIn fact, Mark Burnett called up. You know Mark Burnett. He did Survivor, Apprentice. So Mark Burnett, who\u2019s a great guy, he calls up and he goes \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. You\u2019re not taking a renewal.\u201d The word is renewal. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Mark. I\u2019m going to run for President.\u201d \u201cNo, no, no, you have to \u2013 nobody doesn\u2019t take a renewal. It\u2019s unheard of in primetime television. Two hours primetime. Are you crazy?\u201d I said, \u201cMark, I have to do this. I\u2019ve done so well in this country. I have to do it.\u201d \nBut you know, I\u2019m leading big in Florida. \nBut one of the polls came out because in South Carolina and North Carolina, I\u2019m leading really big. \nAnd in South Carolina, a poll came out and we had a statement that my level of popularity or favorability \u2013 you know, I\u2019m the only one that can get a poll and it comes out and these guys in the back with all those red lights on will say \u2013 I think I had one poll where I\u2019m 41% \u2013 almost 41% \u2013 can you imagine? 41%. There\u2019s 17 people. So I\u2019m at 41% with 17 people and they said \u201cTrump\u2019s at 41% but look\u201d \u2013 you can\u2019t even hear it. You know, \u201cTrump says bleh\u201d. Nobody knows what they just said. \n\u201cBut there are some people that don\u2019t like him.\u201d \nIt\u2019s unbelievable. I\u2019m the only one that wins these polls and I get negative publicity. No, it\u2019s incredible. The press, ayeyayay. \n...Well, yesterday, you might have seen me. I was in South Carolina. I made a speech. I had to bring it up. \nThe New York Times to me is a big deal. You know, I\u2019m from New York. Very liberal paper but that\u2019s okay. You know, not everybody could be like us. But it\u2019s still the New York Times. Right? We have to admit, still the New York Times. \nAnd I\u2019m on the front page a lot on the New York Times, and to be on the front page of the New York Times is a big deal. \nBut yesterday or two days ago, they had story about me and they had some low level Hispanic commentator. Low level guy. This one didn\u2019t like me. \nBy the way, I think I\u2019m going to win the Hispanic vote and I think \u2013 you know, in Nevada, I won the Hispanic poll. They love me. \nI love the Hispanic people. Incredible energy. Incredible people. I love the people. I have so many \u2013 I have thousands that work for me and thousands and thousands over the years and have worked for me. They\u2019re great people. \nAnd I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to win\u201d. And a lot of the Hispanics that are here legally, they don\u2019t want people coming in illegally. You know it\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. \nSo there\u2019s this poll that comes out. I think it was in South Carolina where we\u2019re way up and Lindsey at 4% and he\u2019s the Senator. I\u2019m at 30%. So I wrote him a note, \u201cCongratulations. I\u2019m only beating you in your home state by 26 points.\u201d \nSo anyways, who cares. \nBut they did something that nobody reported. They say, \u201cOh but do people like Trump?\u201d By the way, this election is not going to be like. \nI think I\u2019m a nice person. I love people. I want to help people. \nWomen\u2019s health issues to me are very important. To Jeb Bush it wasn\u2019t important because he didn\u2019t want to fund them. And then he said, \u201cOh, I misspoke.\u201d \nBut you know, I really want to be a nice person and I am a nice person. \nBut I think it\u2019s actually going to be an election based on competence. We\u2019re tired of being like the patsy for everybody. I really do. I think it\u2019s time. \nBut in the poll, this was the Monmouth poll. Big poll. Highly re \u2013 \u201cIn another act of political magic...Trump managed to flip his favorability rating from negative\u201d \u2013 nobody wrote this by the way. Nobody said it. Nobody reported it. \u201cFrom negative to positive.\u201d \nThis is an exact quote. I have like this photographic memory so I don\u2019t need \u2013 but I want to be sure because if I used the word \u201cthe\u201d incorrectly, they\u2019ll say, \u201cHe didn\u2019t \u2013 \u201c \n\u201cFavorability rating from negative to positive in one poll during the span of a month\u201d. A feat that Monmouth University\u2019s Patrick Murray\u2019s highly respected pollster called \u201castounding\u201d. \nCalled it \u201castounding.\u201d Nobody else wrote about it. \n\u201cThat defies any rule in presidential politics that I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said this highly respected man. \nMurray, the director of the polling institute, said he flipped it from 20% to 52% in one month and he said that he\u2019s never seen that before. \nAnd you know what? That\u2019s because people have heard me and they say \u201cYou\u2019re such a nice person.\u201d No, they want \u2013 they say he\u2019s a man \u2013 I\u2019ve made a tremendous amount of money. I\u2019ve had tremendous success. And I don\u2019t say that braggingly. That\u2019s the kind of thinking we need in the country. I mean, whatever it is. \nBut to me, that statement was more important than actually literally killing everybody in the poll. We were much, much higher, more than double everybody. \nAnd we are more than double everybody. \nBeada remembers that. You\u2019d have a cold. The doctor would come over carrying a little bag like this big, beautiful little bag, being at the top. And he\u2019d come over to your house, check you out, fine. Those days don\u2019t exist anymore. \nYou know, we\u2019re in age of Obamacare where nothing exists. \nBy the way, we will repeal and replace Obamacare. That I can tell you. That I can tell you. \nBut, so two weeks ago Wednesday, the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration. So that if you go to the doctor\u2019s office, men and women are waiting four days, three days, one was five days. \nOne case was five days or six days, finally got to see the doctor and the doctor excused himself because he was going on vacation. \nNow, you think about that. Can you imagine waiting even a day or a half a day? But these people are waiting four, five days. \nSo the wait\u2019s now the longest in history and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re treating our greatest people and that\u2019s not right and we\u2019re going to change that. We\u2019re going to change that. \nWe have right now \u2013 and people don\u2019t know this. You know, they see these phony statistics put out by politicians basically. All talk, no action politicians. And I mean on both sides in all fairness. \nYou know, I\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m a conservative. But I\u2019m just as angry with the Republicans because they go to Washington, something happens \u2013 they become weak. You know, they go to Washington \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop Obamacare. We\u2019re going to stop this. We\u2019re going to do this. We\u2019re going to do that.\u201d \nThen they walk into these magnificent buildings with those incredible vaulted ceilings, and they go \u201cOh, I made it, darling, I made it. I vote for you. I vote for you. I vote for Obamacare expansions. I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do. I\u2019m in Washington.\u201d \nIt\u2019s amazing. Isn\u2019t it amazing? Don\u2019t you agree? \nI won\u2019t happen to me, I promise. \nAnd if it does, you can let me know about it. But it won\u2019t. I promise. I promise. \nBut you know, they show those phony statistics where we\u2019re 5.4% unemployment. 5.4%. The real number. You know, I actually saw a number it could be 42%, okay, believe it or not. \nBut when you think about it, we have 93 million people that are right now out of the labor force. 93 million people. Of the 93 many of these people want jobs. And they quit looking. \nSo if you\u2019re looking for a job and you can\u2019t find it and you stop for a while \u2013 you know, after a while you sort of like \u201cIt\u2019s not happening. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d I don\u2019t know what they do. But they stop. They are considered statistically employed. Okay? \nSo, we have 93 million people out of the labor force. I mean, think about it. It\u2019s hard to believe. \nWe have 50 million people in poverty. These are very new numbers. 50 million people in poverty. Taking our money. \nJapan\u2019s taking our money. \nMexico is beating us at the border and on trade. By the way, they\u2019re killing us on trade. You know that. \nIn fact, you just lost a big car plant to Mexico in Tennessee. Remember? Recently front page Wall Street Journal. A plant that you were going to have... \nYou know this is a movement, folks. This is not like maybe even about me. I don\u2019t want it to be about me. This is about common sense. It\u2019s about doing the right thing. \nOne of the things that came out in the poll, which was really amazing. Some of the polls, I mean, hey, in Iowa, we\u2019re leading big. Those are great people. We just left Iowa. We had such an amazing evening. 4,000 people in a room that never had that many people and it was a happening. \nWe just left Alabama, which was unbelievable. 31,000 people in a stadium, and it was supposed to pour. And it did. It poured the minute my speech \u2013 that\u2019s like luck. That\u2019s from God. The minute the speech was over, we got it and it poured. We had 31,000 people and it was the most unbelievable. \nAnd the poll just came out in Alabama, leading big in Alabama. Leading big in Iowa. Leading tremendously big in New Hampshire. Great people. Leading really big in New Hampshire. \nLeading big in Florida. How about Florida? I have a governor. We have a low energy governor and we have a Senator and we\u2019re leading big in Florida. How do you do that when you have a Senator who\u2019s sitting, you have a governor who\u2019s been there for eight years and Trump \u2013 ? I love Florida and I\u2019m there a lot. What could be in Florida? Great weather. You have great weather but Florida has great weather. Big advantage. \nSo, coming over I heard and I watched television \u2013 you know, they have all these cameras back there and they\u2019re live. And I guess we\u2019re live on CNN, we\u2019re live on so many different things. It\u2019s always difficult. You know, when you\u2019re always live, you\u2019ve got to change up your speech. You can\u2019t make the speech over and over... \nThe other candidates don\u2019t get covered live ever, except for the debate. \nSo you know, they had 24 million people on the debate. Now they think when the new numbers come out they\u2019ll be even substantially higher than that. \nSo I would\u2019ve said they would have had a million or two. So I say they have 24 million people. And I say, well now the second debate, which is on CNN \u2013 that was on Fox, maybe I should ask for a lot of money and give the money to charity. Does that make sense? All to charity. All to charity. \nWhen I said that to the writers at Time Magazine, they were nice enough to put me on the cover with actually a nice story. And I said, you know, and I sort of thought I said it off the record but they put it in Time Magazine. So now \u2013 maybe should I ask for charity, maybe a nice Nashville charity and American Cancer Society and AIDS research \u2013 so many of this \u2013 there\u2019s so many good \u2013 Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 you know, there\u2019s so many things going on. Maybe I should ask for a lot of money or I\u2019m not showing up. \nYou know, it\u2019s interesting. So they\u2019ll get 2 million \u2013 a million to 2 million people at the debates. You know, they\u2019ve been doing them for a long time. They don\u2019t do great, especially the early Republican debate. Like you know the expression \u2013 it draws flies? That\u2019s what it draws. \nSo this was one of the biggest shows in the history of cable television. I think it might have been the biggest in terms of political in the history of cable television. \nNaturally I took full credit for it, which in all fairness I should. I should. \nSo bottom line I think I might ask for a lot of money for charity but you know. But I did say is it a little hokey if I do that? Maybe it\u2019s not so nice. So what do you think? Should I do it or not? Maybe not. I don\u2019t know. \nHere\u2019s the thing. If I don\u2019t do it, CNN just makes a lot of money. I don\u2019t care about CNN. Honestly. No, they\u2019re going to make a lot of money. They just shut off their camera. \nThey\u2019re actually very nice. \nBut they\u2019re going to make a lot of money and, you know, it\u2019s something we should consider. So we\u2019ll all consider it together. \nBut coming over today, I saw that they were having the illegal immigrants come in and somebody mentioned the term the DREAMERs having to do with children and, you know, the dreams of children. And these are people who come over to the country and they\u2019re DREAMERs. \nAnd I said, \u201cWhat about our children?\u201d Why can\u2019t our children that are in the country, why can\u2019t they be the dreamers? Nobody ever talks about that. No, no, nobody ever talks about that. \nYou know, we talk about the DREAMERs, we talk about illegal immigrants, who by the way are treated better than our vets. \nYou know, our vets are incredible. No, no, the illegal immigrants in many cases...are treated better than our veterans who are the greatest people we have \u2013 our wounded warriors are \u2013 these are the greatest people we have. \nAnd another thing nice about being able to make speeches without having to hire some guy to write and keep writing and reading it and put a teleprompter then say, \u201cGood morning ladies and gentlemen. Nashville, it\u2019s wonderful \u2013 \u201c you know, is that I can sort of be very current. Okay? I can be very, very current. I can talk about what\u2019s happening. \nThis morning on the television, they had a whole story about the Veterans Administration and the hospitals how people are waiting on lines to get in. These are our veterans. These are the people that got hurt fighting for us. Maybe we wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for them, to be honest with you. I mean, that\u2019s possible too. \nThey had a story this morning on Fox, on CNN and a number of them where the veterans are just treated terribly and they showed a desk where there\u2019s supposed to be people behind this desk and they showed this desk and there\u2019s nobody there. And the veterans \u2013 I don\u2019t know, probably some of you saw it, the veterans are saying \u201cWhere are the people?\u201d \nAnd then, they said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d And they said, \u201cThis happens all the time.\u201d There was not even \u2013 nobody even there! And two weeks ago on Wednesday, they had the longest wait in the history \u2013 in the history of the Veterans Administration for people wanting to see a doctor. \nWhen I go to a doctor, if I have to wait like 9 minutes, I\u2019m like \u201cGet me \u2013 \u201c I\u2019d go crazy. It\u2019s true. \nRemember the old days when the doctor used to come to your house? Right? \n...I\u2019m going to tell you a story about Nashville. You\u2019re not even going to believe it. But it\u2019s a very personal story. It\u2019s a very special place to me for a very special reason. \nBut maybe more importantly, we have an incredible woman with us. She\u2019s 92 years old. We don\u2019t talk about age but she\u2019s 92. And she looks magnificent. And her name is Beada and she\u2019s become very famous. You know who Beada is, right? \nBeada, where are you Beada? Look at her. So beautiful. \nSo, she just registered to vote for the first time in her life. She hasn\u2019t seen anybody that really did it to her. And for the first time in her life she just registered to vote and she\u2019s going to vote for Trump. I think, right? \nThank you, darling. I really appreciate it. You know, she\u2019s become so famous. She\u2019s on television all over the world now. \nI have to be nervous even talking to her, you\u2019re so famous. It\u2019s great. \nBeada, thank you very much. I really appreciate it and everybody appreciates it. \nBecause there is a big, big growing like leaps and bounds silent majority out there and we\u2019re going to take this country back and we\u2019re going to make this country so great again and so strong again. \n...Well, I just want to tell you about Nashville. So, years ago \u2013 many years ago \u2013 like I hate to say 40 but I won\u2019t say 40 but close to 40, I came to Nashville. Did you ever hear of a company called Genesco? Genesco. Right? So, they were based in Nashville, Tennessee, and they owned the Bonwit Teller department store chain. \nAnd I was a young guy and I came from Brooklyn in Queens, and I wanted to go into Manhattan. And I went into Manhattan and I did the Grand Hyatt Hotel and I did some other things that were good. \nBut the thing I wanted more than anything was Fifth Avenue between 57th and 56th Street, which is called the Tiffany Location right next to Tiffany. And that\u2019s what I wanted. I wanted that piece of property so badly. \nI shouldn\u2019t say that because you\u2019re not supposed to want things like that so badly. God will get angry at me, right? \nBut I wanted it so badly and the company that owned it was Genesco based in Nashville, Tennessee. \nAnd I came in and I came to Nashville, and I met with the heads of Genesco who were really great people actually. And they were having a lot of difficulties. There were a lot of fighting and a lot of everything. \nAnd I convinced them to sell me the land and the building. And I bought the Bonwit Teller store Fifth Avenue from 57th to 56th street surrounding Tiffany. I bought all the air rights and then ultimately I bought the air rights from Tiffany and I built Trump Tower. And to this day it\u2019s one of the great buildings of the world and it\u2019s one of the great successes. \nAnd I love country music and I went to the Grand Ole Opry while I was here. And I just had such an incredible experience. \nAnd when it came down to speaking because we could speak at a lot of places \u2013 you know, when you\u2019re leading in every poll, they sort of want you. When you\u2019re not leading in the polls, like so many of these guys, they don\u2019t want you at all. \nAnd we\u2019ll talk about the polls in a second. \nBut I had a lot of choices for this morning, and I guess I could have also gone and played golf like the President does all the time, right? But I decided let\u2019s do this. \nAnd I really chose Nashville because the experience is one of my \u2013 it\u2019s not my biggest deal but in terms of a deal it\u2019s so important and it\u2019s been such a great \u2013 from the day I built it it was a home run. And it all really took place because of Nashville, Tennessee. So, I really \u2013 it\u2019s an honor to be with you folks, I can tell you. Real honor. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Janesville, Wisconsin", "text": "...Very sad but I think it\u2019s going to be really a story of hope and something that is really great is going to happen out of that. You watch. \nBut it sort of tells me when I first said this people would say, \u201cOh, it will cost a lot.\u201d Forgetting about the campaign. That\u2019s peanuts by comparison. You know, I\u2019ve spent tens of millions of dollars. \nBut the big thing \u2013 I lost certain businesses and I owned the Miss Universe Pageant. I bought it very inexpensively many years ago \u2013 15 years ago \u2013 and because of the fact that they thought I was against this woman or that one, I had a hard time with television. \nNow, the good news is I sold it for a wonderful \u2013 I was very happy with that. But I didn\u2019t want to sell it. But I sold it and I built it to really a great company. We did a great job with that company \u2013 Miss Universe, Miss USA, Miss Teen USA. \nBut other businesses \u2013 I sort of \u2013 like the shirts and the ties with Macy\u2019s. Macy\u2019s was unbelievably disloyal because of illegal immigration and they ended the shirts, ties. Who care? I mean, that\u2019s not a big deal. \nBut I\u2019m doing something \u2013 nobody is giving up what I\u2019m giving. \nI mean, when Cruz runs, he runs. If he wins, great. If he loses, great. You know, it\u2019s him. He\u2019s a politician. They just \u2013 they run, they win, they lose, who knows? \nBut these guys run for office. That\u2019s all they do. \nI\u2019ve always heard that if you\u2019re a very successful person, you can\u2019t run for office, especially for president. You just can\u2019t run for president, and I can see it. I have so much false press about me. Things that are so false. \nYou know, I saw the other day on television, there were like 56,000 negative ads on me. 56,000. \nIn fact, in Florida, I own Doral and in Florida we had the tournament there two weeks. Adam Scott \u2013 the great Adam Scott \u2013 the great golfer. He was winning. And in between shots, I told you this after the victory speech, in between they have commercials and they were all about Trump. Negative, horrible, negative commercials. Mostly false. Mostly. Not all false. But mostly false, I have to be honest. \nBut it came out the other day, I think it said \u201c$68 million, 55,000 negative ads.\u201d Negative ads. \nAnd when I was running in Florida, I said \u201cHow is it possible to win?\u201d I mean, with all of this because I knew it. You couldn\u2019t turn on in Florida where I was you couldn\u2019t turn on the television without seeing Trump commercials. Sometimes four or five in a row. And they were horrendous. Done by very, very bad people. Very bad, evil people. \nAnd I said, \u201cHow it is possible to win?\u201d \nAnd God helped me. Honestly. Because I won in a landslide. I won by almost 20%. \nAnd now they\u2019re doing it here. Club for Growth. It\u2019s a crooked outfit. \nLook, Club for Growth \u2013 you ever hear this? Club for Growth \u2013 a friend of mine, he\u2019s a conservative guy. He goes would you do me a favor? See Club for Growth. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s Club for Growth?\u201d He said, \u201cThey want to talk to you.\u201d I said, \u201cAll right. Send them up.\u201d He\u2019s a friend. He\u2019s a good guy. And now I\u2019m in politics so I have to see people I wouldn\u2019t normally... \nSo Club for Growth, they come up to my office. This guy was I think a former Congressman. And he tells me a little bit about Club for Growth and I\u2019m falling asleep. And then he goes, \u201c$1 million.\u201d And I said, \u201c$1 million for what? I don\u2019t even know you. I\u2019ve never met you.\u201d I said, \u201cDo me a favor.\u201d I\u2019m trying to be nice and I said, \u201cGo back and write me a little note if you can.\u201d And he was stupid enough to write me a note. \nHe writes me a letter asking for $1 million. I let him know that I\u2019m not interested. You could be rich. I\u2019d rather take a million and throw it all over this room. I\u2019d rather give it to you, to your boy. \n...They write me a letter. It\u2019s like extortion. They asked me for a $1 million. I said no nicely. And then they\u2019re doing ads all over Wisconsin. Club for Growth. They did it all over Florida. Club for Growth. About eminent domain. \nBy the way, without eminent domain, you wouldn\u2019t have highways, you wouldn\u2019t have hospitals, you wouldn\u2019t have bridges. You need eminent domain. If something\u2019s in your way and you\u2019re building a highway, if you\u2019re producing 7,000 jobs and you need a little corner of someone\u2019s property, every once in a while. \nYou know, it\u2019s funny. These guys all want the Keystone Pipeline. Right? Everyone. Conservatives. Conservatives want the Keystone Pipeline. I like the Keystone Pipeline too. But they have a whole big thing on eminent domain in their prospectus because without eminent domain, they wouldn\u2019t go 15 feet. They wouldn\u2019t be able to build it. \nSo, they don\u2019t want eminent domain. They do commercials about eminent domain. They love the Keystone Pipeline, and the whole Keystone Pipeline is based around eminent domain because you\u2019ve got to go from Canada, where Cruz was born, to Texas, where he\u2019s representing. Think of it. \nThis guy \u2013 and don\u2019t forget that. Remember what I said. I\u2019m going to win. Just remember what I said. I\u2019m going to win. And I thank you... \nI\u2019m going to win. But remember this. If for some reason he does, he gets the nomination, the first thing \u2013 remember, I\u2019m a good prognosticator, I\u2019m a good predictor \u2013 the first thing that\u2019s going to happen is the Democrats are going to sue Ted Cruz. He was born in Canada. He lived there for four years. The head of the Harvard Law School, one of the top people in the business in terms of Constitution, is saying that, you know, he\u2019s wrong. And we have a bunch of other people that are much stronger than even that. \nRemember this. If Cruz gets lucky and wins, and the only way he can get lucky is if he doesn\u2019t get \u2013 because it\u2019s all establishment. You know, if I go into that whole mess of the convention, I\u2019m not the establishment. I don\u2019t take their money. I don\u2019t hire their people. I don\u2019t do any of that stuff. Okay? So you have a disadvantage. \nBut if Cruz wins, remember what I said. Just remember. Again, he\u2019s not going to win. But if he does, he gets the nomination, within the first few days he will be sued by the Democrats that he doesn\u2019t have the right to be president. And I think they\u2019re right because he wasn\u2019t born on our soil. He wasn\u2019t born. He\u2019s not a natural born citizen. He\u2019s not a natural born citizen. \nI don\u2019t like to make a big deal of this but it was just brought up by somebody. He is not a natural born citizen. So if for some reason he should get the nomination, I really believe you\u2019re wasting your time and boy do we have a problem because you\u2019re going to have somebody that\u2019s going to be sued, probably will lose the lawsuit. \nAgain, he was born there, lived there for four years, mother was there, the whole thing for a long period of time, and he was a Canadian citizen joint with U.S. until 14 or 15 months ago. Did anyone know that? So he was a senator from Texas, only because of the great Sarah Palin by the way, without Sarah Palin, he could have never won that election. It was a fluke. But he was a Senator from Texas. He lived \u2013 he was a joint citizen. Now, he finally gave up his citizenship to Canada like 16 months ago. He said, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know I was a citizen of Canada also.\u201d Just like he didn\u2019t know that Goldman Sachs and Citibank gave him money. I mean, this guy is \u2013 you just have to study him, folks. \nLook, again, I\u2019m doing this. We\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to turn this country around. We\u2019re going to make America great again. We\u2019re going to win a lot. But you have to know the facts. \nI love you all. I love you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Get out there and vote! Thank you! \nWoman from the audience :\n...I was Miss Wisconsin USA in 2005. \nWoman:\nThank you. You have been \u2013 I just want to say thank you. You saved me in so many ways. \nIn recent years, I\u2019ve been struggling with an incurable illness and I\u2019m on home care now. It\u2019s caused by a doctor\u2019s medical negligence. \nAnd in those dark days fighting \u2013 right now all the tubes have been removed and I have a Do Not Resuscitate Order and I have a seven-year-old son \u2013 in those days in the hospital, I received from you a handwritten letter that said, \u201cTo the bravest woman I know.\u201d \nAnd are you coming along okay? \nWoman:\nNo, sir. But that\u2019s okay because I\u2019m here right now to thank you in person and that was my biggest dream. \nAnd I wanted to thank you because through you and your organizations, my son who\u2019s Mexican-American, seven-years-old, through your organization and just being able to stand on that stage with you back in 2005 the outpouring of love that can from that ultimately provided my son when he graduates high school with a full ride to college. \nWoman:\nSo we thank you. God bless you. And just, you know, he\u2019s a Mexican-American, and you because of your efforts have sent him to college. And I have been writing letters to him for when I\u2019m in heaven to tell him that what you\u2019ve done for him now he has a great responsibility to pay it forward just as you have done for us. \nI have to go down and say hello. Is that okay? \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWhat you just said...what about Ukraine? Don\u2019t worry about Ukraine. Ukraine is going to be fine. Just don\u2019t ask me why. \nYou know, this world of politics \u2013 \u201cMr. Trump, you said -\u201c don\u2019t forget I\u2019m the one that said take the oil. I was right. They didn\u2019t take the oil. You know who has the oil right now? ISIS has the oil. \nYou know, that Libya \u2013 ISIS has all that oil from Gaddafi, all of that big oil from Gaddafi. He took it. We\u2019re like a bunch of dummies. \nWhy aren\u2019t we embargoing? Why aren\u2019t we creating a nice big circle so they can\u2019t get the oil out? Why aren\u2019t we taking that oil back? \nLook, look, look, I\u2019m the one that says though I don\u2019t want to say everything. \nIf I win, I have a good chance of winning. I\u2019m the frontrunner by a lot. I want to go in there. I want to knock the hell out of ISIS. I don\u2019t want to tell all. I really mean this. \nI don\u2019t want to tell everybody in this room \u2013 and look at all the cameras that are going now \u2013 I don\u2019t want to tell the world what I\u2019m going to do because they\u2019re watching. \nJust let me do it folks. I will do it. You would be so happy. You don\u2019t have to know the details. Okay? Let me do it. \nYou know, I used the word before. We have to be a little bit unpredictable. We can\u2019t say, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going and attack on March 14th and then we\u2019re going to hit them from the front and then we\u2019re going to hit them from the back.\u201d \nYou know, Obama did that eight months ago with one of the cities. He said, \u201cWe\u2019re going in next week.\u201d \nLook, folks, folks, folks, you know, you have to trust \u2013 there has to be some trust. Right? Do you trust? \nWe\u2019ve got to stop the stupid. That\u2019s why I really think your question is so great \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear how you\u2019re going to do it, Mr. Trump. Just do it.\u201d I\u2019ll do it. Okay? \nI love that. That woman! That woman! Thank you, honey. Thank you. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \n...Well, we have to get discipline back in the country, forget about school. We have to get discipline \u2013 \nI mean, I have a case. I have a wonderful guy \u2013 campaign manager. You talk about discipline. And you probably saw what happened today with my campaign manager. He\u2019s a good guy. Corey [Lewandowski]. \nAnd by the way, the easiest thing \u2013 \u201cCorey, you\u2019re fired.\u201d I can\u2019t do that. Can\u2019t do it. \nSo fortunately, I have a taping system. You know, very \u2013 I\u2019m rich so I have tapes all over. \nSo this young woman who complained, was all \u2013 she was talking about being maybe thrown to the floor and all this. I said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s horrible.\u201d And then we saw the tapes. \nDid anybody see the tape? What did you think? Right? Nothing. \nWomen \u2013 what did you think? [Audience response inaudible]... \nI mean, she wasn\u2019t like \u2013 her face stayed the same. \nIf somebody squeezed your arm or did something really bad \u2013 don\u2019t forget \u2013 initially she said thrown to the floor. But if somebody squeezed your arm or hurt you, wouldn\u2019t you start screaming or something? \nDid you see any change in her face? [Audience response inaudible]\n \n...It\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s horrible. Honestly, it\u2019s horrible. \nAnd the best thing I could do is say \u2013 but I can\u2019t destroy a man. I\u2019d destroy him. Got a beautiful wife and children and I\u2019m not going to destroy a man for that. \nAnd you know what? When I saw that at the tape, at first I said, \u201cOh, this is terrible.\u201d Then I saw the tape. It\u2019s my tape. I\u2019m the one that had the tape. It\u2019s on the ceiling of this incredible club in Jupiter, Florida, and we\u2019re all leaving and we have a press conference. Right? \nAnd the press conference lasted a long time. It was like 45 minutes. So that was enough. \nI\u2019m leaving with a whole big gang of people. People pushing left and right, left and right. \nAnd all of a sudden, she bolts into the picture. She grabs me or hits me on the arm. In fact, I\u2019m like this with my arm up and then he goes by and maybe he touched her a little bit. But I didn\u2019t \u2013 it was almost like he was trying to keep her off me. Right? \nLike he was helping her. And did you see her fall to the ground? \nOkay, because she talked about falling to \u2013 now after, I must tell you, her statement changed big league because she said go to the ground. You know, all this. I could read it to you. Does anybody want to hear it? \nI mean, I want to be accurate because I\u2019d like the press to treat me. \nSo before she knew she was on tape, she said \u201cI was jolted backwards.\u201d \nWas she jolted backwards? I mean, if she was, her face stayed the same. I mean. \n\u201cI was jolted backwards. Someone grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me me down. Campaign managers aren\u2019t supposed to forcefully throw reporters to the ground, except she never went to the ground. She never even came \u2013 flinched. \nShe didn\u2019t \u2013 you know, if somebody grabbed you even one of the guys, even the bikers, if somebody grabs even a biker or punches you a little bit, you\u2019re \u201cWhoa!\u201d Right? I mean, the toughest guy, the toughest woman. Look at her face. It\u2019s zero. \nThey\u2019re going to destroy a man\u2019s life? \nAnd then I have Cruz saying, \u201cOh, that was a terrible thing. That was a terrible thing.\u201d \nLet me tell you something, folks. If I win, if I lose, I didn\u2019t need to do this. I\u2019m doing this because I just had a beautiful grandchild with Ivanka. Ivanka and Jared \u2013 beautiful, beautiful grandchild. It\u2019s my eighth. I\u2019m doing this all for them. \nI didn\u2019t need to do this. This is not so easy. And I had no idea. You know, maybe none of us did. You know, I had no idea the message was going to get across. It\u2019s a message of competence. It really is. It\u2019s a message of common sense and it\u2019s a message of competence. \nAnd I had no idea that we\u2019d have millions of more votes than we had when we had that stiff Mitt Romney \u2013 a total stiff \u2013 who by the way he\u2019s a dope. He\u2019s not a smart person. I\u2019ll tell you right now. \nLet me tell you about Mitt Romney. That was an election he should have won and he lost. And he should just go away and let the big boys do it now because you know what? That\u2019s an election that should have been won. \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what. I helped John McCain and at that time, honestly, that was a tough deal for him because the world was sort of collapsing. But he lost. \nAnd I helped Mitt Romney a lot and he lost. And I said, \u201cThis time, we\u2019re going to do it ourselves. We\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win.\u201d So just remember that. \nWe\u2019re going to win because of Wisconsin, I hope... \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nDo you think I can take you in a fight? I don\u2019t think so. \nHow about we do it right now? That would be great for television... \nGo ahead. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nYou know what you\u2019re saying? I\u2019ve heard this so many times before with the daycare and everything else. We are going to take care of our vets. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI want to bring money back into this country. I want to bring jobs into this country. I want to bring tremendous wealth into this country. I want to take our wealth back from China, from Mexico, from all of these countries that have our wealth. They\u2019ve taken them like we\u2019re a bunch of babies. \nAnd we\u2019re going to save your Social Security and we\u2019re going to save your Medicare. They want to get rid of it. Okay? Remember that. \nI want to use not too many executive orders folks. You know, because executive orders came about more recently. Nobody ever heard of an executive order. \nThen all of a sudden Obama, because he couldn\u2019t get anybody to agree with him and he start signing them like they\u2019re butter. \nSo I want to do away with executive orders for the most part. \nBut look, just do me a favor. Stick with me. You\u2019re going to be okay. All right? \n...I know, what you\u2019ve said I\u2019ve heard a hundred times and daycare is a huge problem. Huge problem. And your wife not working? Huge problem \u2013 she can\u2019t. So anyway, I bet you have a great wife. Good wife? Better believe it. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWe\u2019re terminating Common Core, and you will see something that\u2019s magic. And I\u2019ve seen it where parents and all of these people \u2013 the uncles, the aunts \u2013 they\u2019re all on the school boards. They get professionals. They have great principals. \nYou can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on from Washington, D.C. Many of the people never even come here. They sit behind their desk in Washington. They draw big salaries. And they\u2019re telling you how to educate their kids. Not going to happen that way. \nAnd I\u2019ve even seen it where they keep graduates \u2013 the child graduates and those parents stay on. They love it because their child went through the system. They love it and they become so good at it. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. \nWe\u2019re one of the worst in the world in education. We\u2019re going to be one of the better ones. Not necessarily \u2013 you know, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to beat Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and China. But we\u2019re going to come very close. \n...So whatever you can do to spread the world, I\u2019ll be around. I\u2019m going to Green Bay. I love their team, by the way. You talk about a great franchise. No, I love it. \nAnd you have a truly great quarterback. I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s probably endorsing somebody else but I don\u2019t care. He\u2019s still a great quarterback. \nTom Brady\u2019s a friend of mine. He said you have a great quarterback. That\u2019s all right with me. When Tom says he\u2019s a great quarterback that\u2019s pretty good. \nBut you know, I really want to win Wisconsin because if we could win Wisconsin, we\u2019re going to put all of this stupidity away. \nWe\u2019re going to put these stupid, stupid people that allow and I\u2019m talking about basically politicians, and in many cases, you know a lot of times people will see deals that are done and I mean take a look at the Iran deal. How bad is that I mean, just as a deal... \nBut many times people will say deals that the country makes, and they\u2019ll say, \u201cHow can our politicians be so stupid?\u201d They\u2019re not stupid. They\u2019re being hit by the lobbyists and the special interests and they make a fortune. Okay? They get tremendous campaign contributions. They\u2019re not stupid. They\u2019re doing it for themselves. \nSo again, I\u2019m not doing that. I\u2019m doing for you. I\u2019m working for you. \nBut just remember, they\u2019re not so stupid like you think. \nBut when you look at the people funding Cruz\u2019s campaign and Kasich\u2019s campaign, and you look \u2013 don\u2019t forget \u2013 Cruz said, \u201cOh the banks, the banks.\u201d You know, he\u2019s going to be Robin Hood. He\u2019s going to be this great guy. \nAnd then in her personal financial disclosure form, he forgot to mention that he borrowed about a million dollars from the banks \u2013 Citibank and Goldman Sachs. He borrowed a million dollars at an interest rate that everybody in this room would be proud to have \u2013 a very low interest rate. Almost no interest. He forgot to announce it on his personal financial disclosure form. He just forgot. He said, \u201cOh, I forgot. I forgot.\u201d \nOkay? So then he hits the banks. He\u2019s controlled by these people, folks. Okay? I mean, what he did was absolutely wrong. But they\u2019re controlled by these people. \nI\u2019m controlled by you. I\u2019m going to do the right thing for you. Okay? So remember that. \nQ&A \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \n22 a day and a lot of people don\u2019t even believe that number. They think it\u2019s almost like an impossible number \u2013 how can it be so bad? \u2013 and it actually could be even worse than that. \nWe are going to take care of them. From their standpoint, they wait, they wait, then they get bad service, then they wait some more \u2013 six, seven, eight days. \nAnd sometimes they\u2019ll see the doctor and the doctor says, \u201cI can\u2019t see you now. I\u2019m going on vacation.\u201d \nYou see the corruptness. \nI just left Phoenix \u2013 21,000 people. Sheriff Joe was there. The job he did was incredible. Incredible. \nYou know they had a little protest. Right? That protest ended so quickly. He arrested three people; everyone else scattered. \nYou know, and you have that kind of a Sheriff here. You have a tough cookie here. I can tell you. I just met him and I can tell you. \nBut you know I have a great policy plan and I\u2019ve gotten a lot of credit for it and it\u2019s on DonaldJTrump.com. And with the veterans when they\u2019re waiting for exorbitant time \u2013 even for a little time \u2013 they\u2019re going to go to the doctor. They\u2019re going to go to local doctors or local hospitals. \nMany of the hospitals are dying for business. You know that they\u2019re dying. Some of these hospitals are dying. They\u2019re going to get immediate treatment, immediate service, we\u2019re going to pay the bills, and we\u2019re going to save a fortune, and they\u2019re going to get great service. \nAnd everybody is in love with it. Everybody loves it. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. So we\u2019re going to take care of our veterans. \nIf we can\u2019t take care of our veterans, we can\u2019t take care of anyone. So we\u2019re going to take care of our vets. \nSo if I would have left a couple of days early, I think I would have won Florida the same. \nBut I\u2019m not going to have anything happen in Wisconsin. We have to win. \nIf we \u2013 look, we have to put these politicians in their place, folks. It\u2019s time. \nAnd believe me, you know, Cruz likes to pretend he\u2019s an outsider and in the meantime he gets all the establishment support, including your governor. \nSo believe me, believe me, they\u2019re all establishment. \nAnd frankly in a way it\u2019s worse because Cruz is establishment and yet he\u2019s got no relationship with the establishment. \nHe goes and he stands on the floor of the Senate for a day and a half and he filibusters, and these Senators \u2013 look, I know. They\u2019re tough cookies. I have the best \u2013 I have one of the great people \u2013 Sen. Jeff Sessions, who\u2019s great. \nNobody better than Jeff. \nAnd you know, Cruz thought he was going to have him and used him in his speech \u2013 \u201cSen. Jeff Sessions\u201d \u2013 and then he comes out and he endorses me. \nBut when you think of it, look, out of all of these Senators, he has one supporter \u2013 Lee \u2013 who\u2019s his friend. I mean, he\u2019s his friend. And by the way took him plenty time to do it. \nBut you know, to stand there and to rant and rave for two days to show people you can filibuster, in the meantime, nothing was accomplished. \nCruz has not accomplished one thing. \nSo he\u2019s an insider but it\u2019s almost like the man on the street because he can\u2019t get anything done. \nHe dislikes people. He calls people like for instance he said horrible things about the Speaker and you know about the Speaker and he said about separately Mitch McConnell. \nI mean, he said some terrible things about \u2013 how do you get things done when you\u2019re calling Mitch McConnell bad names. Okay? Let\u2019s just say bad names. \nSo he\u2019s sort of got the worst of all elements. He\u2019s an insider totally but he can get nothing done. Okay? He can get nothing done. \nYour new Speaker \u2013 how do you like Paul Ryan? How do you like him? \nWow. I was told be nice to Paul Ryan because \u2013 really? \nWell, he\u2019s the Speaker. He\u2019s a nice guy. He called me the other day. He was very nice. \nBut I\u2019m very surprised at this statement. Wow. Are you all Republicans? Are you mostly conservatives? \n...I always say I\u2019m just a common sense conservative. And so, so important \u2013 common sense. \nAnd somebody told me today that somebody else \u2013 I think, Walker \u2013 used my term. \nYou know, Walker used \u2013 I said, \u201cMake America great again.\u201d I said, \u201cMake America great again\u201d, and I copyrighted the term. \nAnd then Walker was making a speech many months ago when he first started and he was saying \u201cMake America great again\u201d because he saw the response that I got. The difference is he didn\u2019t get any response. So then no. \nBut we told him he can\u2019t do that. That was the first real problem I had with him... \nNow, I said a common sense conservative and today I heard he used the term because the press was up and they interviewed me and they said he said he\u2019s a common sense conservative. \nWell, I coined the phrase a few months ago. That\u2019s what I am. I am a conservative. \nI\u2019m very, very conservative on the military. I\u2019m very conservative with our vets and on health care and on lots of things. \nBut \u2013 and I\u2019m actually very conservative on trade but a lot of people would say \u201cHe\u2019s not that conservative on trade because he doesn\u2019t believe in free trade.\u201d Well, actually I do believe in free trade. But it\u2019s got to be good trade for us, right? It\u2019s got to be smart trade. \nIt can\u2019t be where Wisconsin is losing thousands and thousands of jobs where you folks can\u2019t get into China but China comes in here like it\u2019s Swiss cheese. That\u2019s what happens. \nYou know, China does not obey the rules. \nNow, I get along great with China. I made a fortune dealing with China. I have two buildings because of China. Big ones in New York and one in San Francisco \u2013 Bank of America \u2013 that I have in partnership with a great company. And it\u2019s because of China. I sell \u2013 I have one of the big leases with one of their big banks \u2013 with the biggest bank in the world actually from China. \nI sell millions of millions of condos to people from China. I like China. \nI\u2019m not angry China. I like them. I think their leaders are doing a great job for them. \nBut our leaders are doing a bad job for us. \nSame with Mexico. I get along great. The Hispanics. I love the Hispanics. I love the Hispanics. But their leaders are killing us on the border and they\u2019re killing us on trade. \nAnd I\u2019m not angry at them. I\u2019m angry at our country and our leadership because it\u2019s grossly incompetent and we\u2019re going to change it around and we\u2019re going to get the best and we\u2019re going to get the finest. \nThey are right now \u2013 who knows what\u2019s happened to them? But right now, they have a big target on their back. \nPeople that we\u2019ve let go of at Gitmo have now killed Americans. You\u2019ve seen that. You saw that yesterday. That came out yesterday. We let people go out of Gitmo and they kill Americans. Okay. Is anybody surprised at that though? Would anybody be surprised? \nAnd we\u2019re keeping it open. Now they\u2019re spending, you know, hundreds of millions to run it. I guarantee you could run it a lot cheaper. You\u2019d have a lot of money left over. \nSo we\u2019re going to get efficiency in government. But we\u2019re going to end Obamacare. We\u2019re going to replace it with something so much better and so much less expensive. \nWe\u2019re going to get rid of Common Core. We\u2019re going to bring our education local. \nWe are going to preserve our Second Amendment. It\u2019s under siege. It\u2019s totally under siege. \nAnd Christianity is under siege. I\u2019ll tell you, Christianity is under siege. \nYou take a look. I\u2019m with the \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you what. I\u2019ve been with so many pastors lately and Jerry Falwell Jr. was an example \u2013 was telling me that \u2013 first of all, he told me something that \u201cYou remind me so much of my father.\u201d I thought his father was a great guy. What his father did with Liberty College and Liberty University. And Jerry to top it off has taken it to a whole new place. \nBut when Jerry was so strong and so great. \nBut I was talking to \u2013 I probably had 50 of the ministers and pastors, different folks came up to my office, and they\u2019re really under tremendous pressure because they don\u2019t want to have their tax exempt status taken away. This happened during the Lyndon Johnson presidency. \nAnd I said, \u201cWhy is it that you folks are pushed around so much?\u201d Christianity. These are the pastors. These are strong people. These are really strong people. \u201cWhy do you allow that? Why aren\u2019t you more forceful?\u201d \nAnd finally, somebody said, \u201cWell, we have to be a little careful of our tax exempt status.\u201d \nI said when did that happen exactly? It was during the Johnson. \nWell, we\u2019re going to try to get rid of that. Okay? Because that\u2019s really terrible. \nWe\u2019re going to try getting rid of \u2013 and I\u2019ve said that to a lot of evangelicals, a lot of great Christians. We\u2019re going to try to get rid of it because it sort of means somebody walking down the street has more power than somebody of religion, of our religion, of Christianity, somebody that\u2019s an evangelical. \nYou take anybody they have more power because these people are powerless. \nThey\u2019ve actually taken their right of free speech away. \nSo I said we\u2019re going to try to get rid of that and I think we\u2019ll be very, very successful. \nYou know, it\u2019s interesting. I said how many Christians are there? Because you know, we\u2019ve got men, we\u2019ve got women. You cut it in half, we\u2019ve actually have a few more women. But we are far more Christians than we have men or women. So in a way, it\u2019s the most powerful lobbyist \u2013 the biggest group of people. \nBut they\u2019re not allowed to talk because they\u2019re petrified. \nYou saw what was happening with the IRS and what was taking place with regard to certain groups. \nSo we are going to try and usually when I say try that means I\u2019m going to get it done. That means I\u2019m going to get it done. \nBut we are going to try very hard. We are going to get that brought back and I think it\u2019s going to be very hard to counter it. \nBecause if the Christians, and if the whole evangelical Christian sector gets together, nobody, nobody can beat \u2013 \nYou know, when I made the statement about banning Muslims on a temporary basis, I took such heat. \nNow people are saying, \u201cYou know, Trump is sort of right about that.\u201d Now they\u2019re all going, \u201cWow\u201d because they see what\u2019s happening. \nAnd I think if I would have said it about Christians, I think I would have had less opposition. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened in this country. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened in our country. \nAnd we can\u2019t let it happen. We\u2019re going to turn this country around and we\u2019re going to be the smart people. We\u2019re not going to be the dummies anymore. \nWe\u2019re not going to be where China made last year trade deficits $505 billion. Japan over $100 billion. Mexico $58 billion. \nWe\u2019re going to build a wall and Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Okay? \n...Recently, I was in Florida and Marco, who\u2019s a nice guy actually. You notice how nice they are after you\u2019ve defeated them? \nI like everybody I defeat. \nBut when I ran against Marco, it was supposed to be...well, he started it. Right? Just like Cruz started the last deal. He started it. \nBut Marco came after me very viciously. You know he wanted to be Don Rickles, right? And it didn\u2019t work. \nBut what happened is I won by 20 points \u2013 almost 20 points \u2013 and a lot of these issue we were talking about it was big issues. And frankly, I wish I would have left about two days earlier. I wanted to stay in Florida campaign. I wish I would have devoted two more days to Ohio because I almost won in Ohio. I would have won in Ohio but I didn\u2019t want to take a chance leaving my beautiful Florida because I love Florida and I wanted to win that. \nBut you know, you do pretty serious damage, right? Because you want to win and you want to win fast and a lot of people don\u2019t love you after you finish. \nBut I just love you. I don\u2019t care about that. \nIn fact, they\u2019re asking Cruz, you know, at the debate which by the way they said I won every single debate. Now I heard the other night, \u201cI want to debate Trump\u201d. I\u2019ve debated him 11 or 12 times. Every single online poll has me winning the debates. He\u2019s an okay debater but he\u2019s a bad talker. You know, everything\u2019s so dramatic. \nAnd he waits. Phony. And he waits. You know, you ever see he goes sentence after sentence and then he stops for like three, four seconds. And then he goes again. It looks like we\u2019re in the theater. We\u2019re not in the theater. We\u2019re in the real world. \nSo what happens \u2013 thank you. \n...By the way, the Sheriff is here and he\u2019s a great guy and his people are fantastic. Thank you, Sheriff. Thank you. \nI mean, the only thing I feel so guilty about all the people outside. Feel so guilty. We\u2019re going to come back. We\u2019re going to come back, come back to this area. You guys cannot come. Okay? All of the ladies can come but the guys can\u2019t. \nBut all of the people outside, we\u2019re going to take a bigger place because I feel slightly guilty. \nBut look, we have a very serious mess on our hands. We have a very serious situation. \nWe have a country that\u2019s not protected. \nWe have a country that\u2019s sitting on a big fat bubble that\u2019s going to explode. In a certain way, I\u2019d say let it do now, don\u2019t do it after I get in. Three days it\u2019ll explode and they\u2019ll say it\u2019s Trump\u2019s fault. Okay? \nAyeyeye, we are in a big fat ugly bubble. We have interest rates that are so low that if you\u2019re rich like me I can borrow money for any amount. If you\u2019re a hardworking guy with a great farm or you\u2019re a hardworking developer or businessman you can\u2019t borrow money. \nYou can only borrow money really cheaply \u2013 think of how bad it is \u2013 you can borrow money for nothing practically if you\u2019re rich. But if you\u2019re rich, you don\u2019t need the money so you don\u2019t have to borrow it. \nBut if you\u2019re a businessperson and you want to go to the bank for a loan, you can\u2019t get it. \nThe regulators are running the banks. Dodd-Frank is a disaster, by the way. It\u2019s a disaster. It\u2019s a disaster. \nBut the biggest disasters are regulations. Our rules and regulations are horrible. We\u2019re going to get rid of probably 85% of them. There are some we live with. But we\u2019ve got to go back. \nSo many people in this area have told me regulations \u2013 regulatory climate \u2013 is the worst they\u2019ve ever seen. \nI have a friend, who\u2019s a farmer, and if a puddle forms, they consider it a lake for the purposes of environmental. It\u2019s like a puddle and they\u2019d consider it a lake. \nSo we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. So here\u2019s what\u2019s happening. We\u2019re going to make our country so great again. We\u2019re going to make our country so strong again. \nOur military is going to be so amazing. We\u2019re never going to have to use it. \nDon\u2019t forget, I didn\u2019t want to go into Iraq. All these guys think that I\u2019m a tough guy so I\u2019m going to be so quick with the trigger. I\u2019m not going to be quick. \nI was the slowest with the trigger. I didn\u2019t want the trigger. \nNow, when Obama left though, he shouldn\u2019t have left the way he did. He gave a certain date, and the enemy said, \u201cIt can\u2019t be possible. Nobody would be that stupid. Nobody.\u201d \nSo I actually don\u2019t think it\u2019d hurt that much because I don\u2019t think the enemy would ever believe that anybody would be stupid enough to give a date \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re leaving on this date.\u201d And then he left. They said, \u201cHe was serious!\u201d They pulled back. They pulled back. Then you see what happened. They pulled back then they went in with fury. \nBut how about the 50 soldiers. He sent a couple of months ago, a few months ago, he sent 50 of our finest and instead of just sending them quietly, quietly sending them. What does he do? He sends them in and he makes a big press conference or announcement that \u201cWe are sending 50 soldiers in Iraq, Syria\u201d and these soldiers have a big target on their backs. \nWhy can\u2019t we just keep our mouths shut? Why can\u2019t we be unpredictable? Unpredictable? Right? Why can\u2019t we be unpredictable? \nWhy does he have to tell \u2013 first of all, it doesn\u2019t even sound good when you say \u201c50 soldiers\u201d because it sounds like so small. People would say, \u201cIs that good or bad?\u201d I mean, that sounds small. \nBut then when you think about it, why do we have to say that? \nThese are extraordinary people. These are our finest. And they\u2019re, you know, very dangerous missions. Why would you tell people that we\u2019re sending them in? You just keep quiet and let them accomplish something. \nYou know that. You saw it. He was there. This guy follows me around, I\u2019ll tell you. \nBut you were there. Remember, he was going to win that in a landslide. And then I started speaking. I started talking to people, and I started saying the good and the bad and the ugly. \nAnd we won in a landslide and we won the evangelicals. I\u2019ve won just about I think almost every place I\u2019ve won with evangelicals. \nAnd it\u2019s been an amazing time. \nSo now I\u2019m here to talk to the people of Wisconsin. I have friends in Wisconsin. I\u2019ve been here before. It\u2019s an incredible place but it\u2019s a place that has problems. \nBut you have a governor that has you convinced that it doesn\u2019t have a problem. \nI remember when he was on the campaign trail, I was so nice to him. I said, \u201cHow can I hit him? I\u2019m not going to hit him. I\u2019m not going to hit him.\u201d \nAnd I was so nice. I hit Jeb instead, right? Right? \nAnd I hit Rand, Rand, old Rand. \nAnd I hit a lot of people and they all went down. \nWouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a president that could just with his mouth make things happen that are positive? You know. \nBut it\u2019s not with the mouth. It\u2019s really with the mouth, the heart, and the brain. Remember the brain. \nI have a lot of friends. They\u2019re good with the mouth but they\u2019re not good with the brain. It all doesn\u2019t work. Okay? \nYou know, we had an interesting thing today. A poll came out \u2013 a nationwide poll. A great poll. It was Trump 48%. It was an NBC poll. Trump 48%. Cruz was second in the 20s, mid-20s something. And Kasich was way down. \nSo what happened is they showed the poll. It was an NBC poll. They call it an NBC monkey poll. And it was on the Today Show, and it was on Morning Joe. Morning Joe held it up and he said, \u201cWow, those are great numbers.\u201d \n48% is pretty good. You have three people. You know. I don\u2019t get enough credit for that. \nI\u2019ve been at 42%, 44%, 45%, and I\u2019ve had like seven people. How do you get 45% when you have seven people? Nobody says that. They say, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t cracked 50%.\u201d How do you crack 50% when you have all these people running? \nSo I\u2019m at 48%. Poll was good \u2013 way, way ahead of anybody else nationwide. And they showed Hillary Clinton \u2013 hers is very close. \nShe\u2019s got a little problem. Could happen. Got a bigger problem with the emails than she has with Bernie to be honest with you. She should have. Her bigger problem should be with emails. We\u2019ll find out how honest our country is, right? \nBut she\u2019s got a sort of close race. And they put her poll up and it was put up there. You know, big letters. \nAnd then they said, \u201cAnd Donald Trump is winning.\u201d That was it. They didn\u2019t put numbers up. They didn\u2019t say I\u2019m doing great. In fact, they said, \u201cDonald Trump is winning,\u201d and they put some \u2013 a little slightly negative statistic in \u2013 it was like wait a minute. They put her numbers up and they didn\u2019t put my numbers up. \nFolks, it\u2019s so unfair. The press is so dishonest. It\u2019s unbelievable. That was Chuck Todd. That was Chuck Todd this morning on the Today Show. \nThey put Hillary\u2019s numbers. And I\u2019m winning by a lot and they said, \u201cDonald Trump is winning. You know, let\u2019s go to a new subject, okay?\u201d \nNow, I guarantee you one thing. If I was losing or doing poorly, it\u2019ll still be up. It\u2019ll be up all morning because they don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m putting up my own money. They don\u2019t like it. \nTed Cruz and Kasich are getting money from the banking industries, the energy industries. They\u2019re getting money from the pharmaceutical companies. They\u2019re getting money from everybody. \nFolks, you can\u2019t straighten out this mess \u2013 we\u2019re in a mess \u2013 if you can\u2019t do what you have to do. \nWhen millions of dollars are given to Cruz and Kasich and millions from different industries, you\u2019re not going to be able to say, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to do and go against the banking industry to do what\u2019s right for the people\u201d if the banking industry gave you millions of dollars. Now, that\u2019s true with Hillary also. Now, she\u2019s gotten millions of dollars. \nBut I\u2019m the only one self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m in for a lot of money. I in a lot of money. \nWhat is beautiful is when I was running against Jeb in New Hampshire. I was in for like $2 million. Jeb was in for like $48 million. I was in first and he was close to last. \nI said, \u201cWho do you want as your president?\u201d \nBy the way, did Jeb endorse anybody yet? Because I haven\u2019t heard. Because I think Jeb probably endorsed \u2013 huh? Did he endorse? It just shows you how important it is. Nobody even knows. I don\u2019t even know. \nHe\u2019ll probably \u2013 he\u2019ll endorse \u2013 just so you know. Look, when you\u2019re in war, you\u2019ve got to fight and you fight hard. \nWhen I fight, I win. You\u2019re going to win. You know that. You\u2019re going to win. \n...But the motorcycle guys love Trump. \nI love the disabled veterans and the veterans. We\u2019re going to take care of our veterans. You know that, right? We\u2019re going to take care of our veterans. \nWhat is it about Trump that they like? \nI\u2019m serious. We went to Hilton Head. We went to different places, and there were hundreds, hundreds of bikers out there. Beautiful bikes. Lots of Harleys, right? Lots of Harleys. Made in America. But beautiful, beautiful bikes... \nI don\u2019t know what it is but they like me. I feel good with them. I feel safe. I got out took a picture. Secret Service went crazy. \nI said, \u201cThese are great people. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d \nBut listen, I appreciate it, fellas, I appreciate it. \n...We\u2019re going to keep you free. I\u2019m going to keep you free. \nBecause we\u2019re getting rid of ISIS. \nWe\u2019re going to have good borders. We\u2019re going to have borders again. We\u2019re going to have borders again. \nSo here we have something that\u2019s pretty interesting \u2013 I love you too. \nYou lost 70,000 jobs to China. 70,000 jobs. \n100,000 illegal immigrants living in Wisconsin. Taxpayers are paying tens of millions of dollars. \nLook, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. \nSo what happened with Walker and I just will finish off with this \u2013 he\u2019s a nice man. He came up to my office like about a year ago before I did \u2013 you know, I\u2019ve been a politician for about eight months, right? I never thought I\u2019d be a politician. The last thing on my mind I want to be was a politician. \nBut I built a great company. I filed papers. The company is incredible. Very little debt, tremendous cash flow, some of the great assets in the world. \nAnd I say that not in a bragging way. I say that because that\u2019s the kind of thinking we need, folks. \nWe can\u2019t have China ripping us off and Mexico and Japan and Vietnam. We can\u2019t have it. We can\u2019t have it. And they are ripping us like they\u2019ve never ripped anybody before. \nWe\u2019ve rebuilt China. I mean, we\u2019re rebuilding Mexico. \nYou look the other day you saw Carrier moving down. Carrier Air Conditioning. I buy those air conditioners \u2013 a lot of them. I\u2019m not buying any more of them. But Carrier Air Conditioning moving to Mexico. Ford moving to Mexico. \nNabsico \u2013 home of the formerly wonderful Oreo which we don\u2019t eat anymore. Right? We don\u2019t eat it. We don\u2019t eat it. Number one, it\u2019s a good \u2013 it\u2019s called an enforced diet. \nBut you know what? Look, we\u2019re losing our jobs. Look at your jobs. \nWhen I see that statistic, I mean you\u2019re losing your jobs. \nWhen I went after your governor when he decided to run and I said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m going to be nice to him. He\u2019s a nice guy.\u201d The guy came up to my office. He handed me a plaque because I supported him. What do I know? I supported him. I gave $50,000 or $100,000. That\u2019s a lot of money for a guy you\u2019ve never met before. Right? That\u2019s pretty good. \nBut I like the fact that he was fighting, fighting, he was always fighting. \nYou know, to a certain extent, I\u2019d rather see somebody able to make a deal without having to go through all of that mess. \nBut he was fighting and I gave him a lot of money and he came up, you know, a year ago or so and he gave me a plaque. Beautiful picture of something. I haven\u2019t \u2013 I never really got to read it to be honest. And I put it aside. That was it... \nBecause if we win Wisconsin, it\u2019s going to be like over, pretty much over. Because we\u2019re going to do great. \n...Emerson poll came out. I think I have 67%, 68% in New York compared to like 10% or whatever, and you have Cruz talk about New York values, New Yorkers are no good. \nI watched New Yorkers rebuild the World Trade Center. I watched New Yorkers dying. \nBelieve me, New Yorkers are good. New Yorkers are very good. But Cruz said they\u2019re no good. \nSo anyways, so I think we\u2019re going to do great in New York. \nWe\u2019re going to do great in New Jersey. Chris Christie endorsed me. We\u2019ll do great in New Jersey. Good guy. \nBen Carson endorsed me. Sarah Palin endorsed me. Sheriff Joe from Arizona. We love Sheriff Joe. \nAnd you know, with the evangelicals, I\u2019ve had so many ministers. I\u2019ve had so many pastors endorse me. And Jerry Falwell, Jr. endorsed me. It was incredible and we\u2019ve done so well with the evangelicals. I mean, Christians, evangelicals, we\u2019ve done so well. \nIn fact, in South Carolina, when we went to South Carolina, that was going to be Cruz\u2019s territory. He was going take it, except we won it in a landslide. \nThank you. I feel so badly. Outside we have 5,000 people and they can\u2019t get in. I feel badly. I want to apologize. We have speakers outside. But I want to apologize. Who would have thought we have over 5,000 people cannot get in. \n...It\u2019s an honor to be here. It\u2019s an honor to be with you. And very important. You know, we\u2019re doing really well and millions of votes ahead of Cruz. Millions. \nYou know, I get a kick. I call him Lyin\u2019 Ted. Lyin\u2019 Ted Cruz. He stands up \u2013 and I win as you know, you\u2019ve seen it. I have been winning all of the evangelical vote. But he stands up Bible high, puts it down and then he lies. You know, it\u2019s amazing to watch it. \nBut he said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m the only one who can beat Donald Trump. I\u2019ve done it time after time.\u201d \nAnd I said, \u201cWait a minute. I\u2019ve won like most of the states.\u201d \nI think he had like 5 or 6 and I had 20 or 22. Right? \nAnd I said I can\u2019t believe it. And I have millions of votes more. \nHe says, \u201cI\u2019m the only one that can out-vote him.\u201d And I\u2019m saying but I have like millions of votes more. \nI\u2019ll tell you something so important. There is something happening. It\u2019s like a movement. It\u2019s incredible. It\u2019s a movement. And we\u2019re part of the movement. \nNot me. I\u2019m a messenger to be honest. I\u2019m a messenger. \nAnd this is something that\u2019s so special and so amazing and it\u2019s on the cover of time magazine. It\u2019s on the cover of every newspaper. It\u2019s something that has maybe never happened and they\u2019re saying it\u2019s phenomenon. \nSometimes they say I\u2019m a phenomenon. I\u2019m not. The message is what we want. \nWe want jobs. We want trade deals that are smart deals not stupid deals. \nAnd you know, Wisconsin. I wrote down some notes...and it\u2019s like devastating. \nSo [Scott] Walker came out today. I wrote down notes about Wisconsin. \nLook, he certainly can\u2019t endorse me after what I did to him in the race. Right? \nBut look at this. By the summer of 2015, Wisconsin was facing a $2.2 billion two-year budget deficit. That\u2019s terrible. \nBy the way, these are out of books. Like this isn\u2019t Trump. This is out of books. \nTotal state debt is $45 billion. Now, maybe somebody is going to tell me that\u2019s wrong but again these are \u2013 $45 billion. Very high. One of the higher ones. \n20,000 fewer people in the labor force in Wisconsin than seven years ago even though population has grown by 100,000. So your population is higher. \nNow, I wouldn\u2019t have done this but he endorsed Cruz. What am I going to do? Am I going to say he\u2019s doing a great job? He\u2019s not doing a great job. \nYou know, he comes in with his big motorcycle jacket and big Harley. I love Harleys. Right? But the motorcycle guys like Trump. They really like Trump. \nAnd he doesn\u2019t look like a motorcycle guy to me. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. \nUnemployment rate \u2013 well, they say \u2013 that can\u2019t be possible. Unemployment \u2013 they have down 20%. That can\u2019t be possible. What? Is it 20%? Effective or regular? Effective unemployment rate 20%. Hey, this is out of the big book. \n800,000 food stamp recipients. \nMiddle class hit very, very hard due to loss of manufacturing jobs. These are the stats. Right? You know about this, right? \nIt goes on and on. \nWisconsin has lost 15,000 net jobs to Mexico since NAFTA. \nNow, just so you understand, Kasich is running also. We forget about him. He voted for NAFTA. \nBoth of them want TPP. TPP \u2013 Trans-Pacific Partnership. Both of them want Trans-Pacific. That will make NAFTA look like a baby, and Wisconsin will be hit so hard. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Toledo, Ohio", "text": "Not only try. The new solutions are common sense. So simple. \nI mean, keeping our jobs. That\u2019s going to work, folks. Let me tell you. It\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s amazing that it\u2019s gone this long. But again, the special interests, the donors, they control the politicians. \nBut I have a message for them. The future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics and not the critics. \nI\u2019m asking all Americans to join me in dreaming big like we used to in this country. Big and bold for our future. \nI\u2019m going to fight for every American of every background in every stretch of this nation. \nI\u2019m going to fight for every mother who has lost her child to illegal immigration or drugs or gang violence. \nI am going to fight for every community in Ohio, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania and all around this nation whose jobs have been ripped out and shipped to other countries because we have people that are not capable of properly representing us. \nSo sad. So easy and so sad. \nI\u2019m going to fight for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. \nAnd I\u2019m going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. We\u2019re living in a divided country. It\u2019s not going to be divided. We\u2019re going to love everybody like we love the people in this room. \nJust imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God saluting one American flag. Think about that. \nOnce again, we will have a government of, by, and for the people. \nAnd we\u2019re going to work on our ghettos so the \u2013 you take a look at what\u2019s going on where you have pockets of areas of land where you have the inner cities and you have so many things so many problems, so many horrible, horrible problems. The violence, the deaths, the lack of education, no jobs. \nWe\u2019re going to work with the African-American community and we\u2019re going to solve the problem of the inner city. We\u2019re going to solve the problem. \nWe\u2019re going to bring back jobs to the inner cities. We\u2019re going to bring proper education, including school choice. And we\u2019re going to bring safety back. We\u2019re going to bring safety back. \nYou can\u2019t walk out the streets. You buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot. \nSo we\u2019re going to work very strongly with the African-American community. \nAnd remember this: The Democrats have been talking about this for years. I mean, 50, 80, 90, 100, unbroken. \nWe are going to solve the educational problem, the crime problem, and the jobs problem of the inner cities. And a lot of people are going to be very happy. Gonna finally happen. \nThey\u2019ve been talking. They want your vote. So they come in and they get your vote and then they get your vote four years later and then they get your vote again. And at some point, people say, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d \nThey only want your vote. Hillary wants your vote. That\u2019s all. \nTogether, we will make all together America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. \nAnd guess what the last one is? See all those beautiful caps? \nWe will make America great again. \nThank you, Ohio. Thank you. Get out and vote. God bless you everybody. Get out and vote. Thank you. \nAnd we will change our foreign policy. \nHillary Clinton\u2019s policies in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya threw the Middle East into turmoil. \nNow, Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with a nuclear armed Russia, which could very well lead to World War III. \nAnd you see the way she talks about Putin. I mean, no wonder Putin doesn\u2019t like her and has no respect for her. \nYou know, they\u2019re nuclear armed. It\u2019s all right. It would be nice if we got along. If we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t. But it would be nice. \nBut how can he get along with her? How can he get along with her? He\u2019s got no respect for her, number one. And the way she talks, it\u2019s ridiculous. \nI\u2019ll tell you what, honestly, if we can have a good relationship with Russia, that would be a good thing. Not a bad thing. I mean, I hate to say it. It\u2019d be a good thing. \nI don\u2019t know that that will happen but it\u2019ll be a good thing. \nOne thing, I\u2019ll figure it out real fast. You understand that. Right? I\u2019ll figure it out real fast. \nTo all Americans, I say it\u2019s time for a new leadership. We have to have new leadership. \nWe cannot have another four years of Barack Obama. Cannot. \nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days. \nWe\u2019re going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. \nWe\u2019re going to eliminate every unnecessary job killing regulation. \nProvide school choice and put an end to Common Core, bring your education local. \nWe\u2019re going to rebuild our military and take care of our great, great veterans. They have not been taken care of. \nWe will support the wonderful men and women of law enforcement. \nSave the Second Amendment, which is under siege, and appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \nAmericans are tired of being told by politicians that they have defer their dreams to another day but really you and I know it\u2019s another decade or many decades away. \nIt\u2019s like our politics are caught in a total time loop. We keep electing the same people over and over again who keep making the same mistakes and who keep offering the same old tired excuses. \nThese career politicians keep telling us that things can\u2019t change, that we can\u2019t try new solutions. \nSo we owed all this money. \nYou know, I like to say if we owe the money and we\u2019re in tippy top shape. Right? Tippy top. But we\u2019re not in tippy top. We\u2019re in terrible shape. Pretty sad. Pretty sad. \nLet me state this as clearly as I can. \nIf I\u2019m elected president, I am going to keep radical Islamic \u2013 when I\u2019m elected president, ready to get out and vote. I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. Believe me. Believe me. \nHillary also said she wants totally open borders, meaning you don\u2019t have a country anymore. \nA Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. \nAnd yes, we will build a wall. A real wall. This will be a real wall. And Mexico will pay for the wall. \nThousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants. And by the way, the border patrol agents and I.C.E. both endorsed me. Endorsed me. First time they\u2019ve ever endorsed a candidate for president. \nRight here in Ohio, 60-year-old Margaret Kostelnik was murdered in cold blood by an illegal immigrant. Earlier that day, her killer shot a woman in the arm while she was with her children in a nearby park. Police encountered the man more than 3 weeks before the crime spree but federal authorities, under Obama, refused to take him into custody. People that knew this thug were begging \u2013 were begging \u2013 that he be incarcerated. He was so dangerous. Nothing was done. \nThen there was the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, a Minnesota farmer who was brutally beaten by illegal immigrants and left to bleed to death in his own house. \nEarl\u2019s body was found with his hands bound behind his back in duct tape and blunt force injuries to his head. \nHis killers had criminal records a mile long but they did not meet the Obama administration\u2019s priority for removal. \nThen you had the recent case of 800 people \u2013 tough ones \u2013 who were going to be deported. You saw that three weeks ago. Right? They were going to be deported. Now, you know if they\u2019re going to be deported from our country, they got to be trouble. What happened is there was a mistake made, and instead of deporting them, congratulations everybody, they became United States citizens. And it was a mistake made. Instead of 800, I have a little bad news for you, instead of 800, it was close to 1,800 people. So they became. \nSo I then said very strongly then undo the error. Undo the error. And they said we can\u2019t do that. It would not be constitutional. Can you believe this? Can you believe it? Right? \nI have a message for the cartels, the drug dealers, and the gang members \u2013 when I win \u2013 when, when! Do you understand me? Your long reign of crime and terror will come to a crashing end. We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense cuts and rebuild our badly depleted military where we have our greatest people. \nWe will rebuild our army, which is the smallest since World War II. And maybe we need it more than ever before. Almost ever before. We\u2019ve had some pretty bad times too. But we need strength. Peace through strength. Right? \nNew order for equipments for our troops will need to come to places like Lima, Ohio. I like Lima better. What do you like? Home of the Abrams tank. Is that the best tank in the world? Is it? Is it the best? \nHillary also says she wants to put coal miners out of work. Not going to happen. Stop producing shale energy in most places, and place a permanent moratorium on energy development on federal lands where vast coal and shale energy and other forms of energy are located. \nMy administration will unleash all sources of American energy, including shale, oil, natural gas, renewables, and clean coal. And we\u2019re putting the miners back to work. We will put our miners back to work. \nAnd we will put our steelworkers who are under siege back to work. \nWe will become a rich nation once again. \nA woman came up to me three months ago. She said, \u201cMr. Trump, I love you. I\u2019m going to vote for you. But you\u2019re making a terrible mistake when you talk about making our country rich again. It doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d I said to me it sounds good. Why? She explained and I understand. You know, in this world of politically correct, you\u2019re going to be rich again. We\u2019re going to make a rich country again. \nWe need to be a rich country again. If we\u2019re going to do what we have to do in terms of infrastructure, which is a disaster. \nYou know, we spent $6 trillion in the Middle East. We could have rebuilt our country twice. And we are not in far worse shape in the Middle East than if our president just went to the beach everyday. Right? \nOr in the case of Obama, went golfing everyday instead of every other day. Right? \nYou see, the problem is he went every other day so therefore the day he stayed in the White House was not good. \nAnd what about this? What about a guy who\u2019s constantly campaigning for crooked Hillary? It\u2019s all he does. Right? It\u2019s all he does. \nHe campaigns \u2013 this guy ought to be in the White House working on jobs, working on our military, working on defeating ISIS. What a terrible situation. \nBut to be a rich country, we also must be a safe country. \nHillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world. The vacuum was created and it spread into the United States. \nThere are now 1,000 open ISIS investigations in the United States. \nISIS is on a campaign of genocide against Christians in the Middle East or what they call the Nation of the Cross. It\u2019s what they call \u2013 the Nation of the Cross. \nThink of that. Think of that. That\u2019s the term they have for Christians. \nAnd people \u2013 who said that over there? Let me see. Who said that? Who\u2019s the guy? \nDon\u2019t worry \u2013 they\u2019re going to be \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you, they are dreaming of having her win. \nDo you ever notice \u2013 she says we\u2019re going to work on the tax code, we\u2019re going to work on ISIS, we\u2019re going to work on this. She\u2019s been there for 30 years. What\u2019s she been doing? Right? What\u2019s she been doing? \nISIS is dreaming \u2013 ISIS is dreaming of her becoming president. That I can tell you. \nThey\u2019re crucifying, drowning, and beheading their victims. Not since Medieval times have we seen what\u2019s happening. \nHave you ever thought you\u2019d see this? They\u2019re throwing people off buildings and hanging their victims from meat hooks. \nThe New York Post just published reports about ISIS crushing children to death and burning adults alive. \nThis is what we have. This is what has been unleashed. \nNow, Hillary wants massive immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world where ISIS operates, including a 550% increase in Syrian refugees entering our country over and above the thousands and thousands already coming here under Obama. \nA Trump administration is going to suspend immigration from terror prone regions and we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. \nAnd you know what? We\u2019ll work and we\u2019ll build safe zones in Syria. We\u2019ll do things. We\u2019ll get the Gulf States to put in the money because our country has no money. We owe $20 trillion \u2013 doubled up under Obama. \nAnd yet, our roads are no good and our tunnels and our hospitals and our bridges and our schools. \nBut I\u2019ll tell you what. I\u2019ll be in for over $100 million and a lot of work and a lot of energy. And they were saying it doesn\u2019t matter. What you\u2019ve done will go down in the record books and history. \nBecause you know, let\u2019s face it. When we started, it was 17 people, I wasn\u2019t exactly favored to win. The only people that thought that I was going to win were the people that knew me. Right? \nI have friends that went and placed bets. They said anytime I can place a bet 3% on Trump, I will \u2013 I have one friend who made a lot of money. \nBut you know what? One by one they\u2019ve disappeared, and now we\u2019re down to one person who\u2019s got low energy. Very low energy. She goes to sleep. \nSo look, here\u2019s the story, folks. Here\u2019s the story. Who is more low energy? Bill O\u2019Reilly just asked me. I just did Bill O\u2019Reilly. He\u2019s on tonight. He said who\u2019s more low energy. Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton? He just asked me that. \nWhat\u2019s the answer? Who? Who? Who\u2019s more low energy? I don\u2019t know. \nAnd you know what I say? Doesn\u2019t matter. \nOhio is at the center of American motor vehicles and the industry is really suffering in terms of production. \nAccording to the state development, almost 75% of all light vehicles produced in North America are made in Ohio or within 500 miles of this great state. \nThe auto industry and its feeder industries account for 10% of Ohio\u2019s economy. \n75 of Ohio\u2019s 88 counties have at least one automotive industry business. \nNearly 1 in 8 Ohio residents are either directly or indirectly employed by the auto industry. \nHillary Clinton supported and lobbied for the South Korea trade agreement. You know that one. That\u2019s been another disaster. On the promise of 75,000 new jobs. \nInstead, her trade destroyed 100,000 jobs, mostly in the auto industry. \nAnd believe me, as you stand here today, your executives are negotiating deals to move businesses out of Ohio and into Mexico and other countries because we have nobody to protect our companies and really nobody to protect our workers. \nNext \u2013 you\u2019ve got me. You\u2019ve got me. Believe me. I\u2019ll protect you. \nHillary wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will kill the rest of our auto jobs and kill jobs generally speaking in this country. \nHere\u2019s the good news. It will never be as bad as NAFTA. You\u2019d never thought I\u2019d say that. \nNAFTA is the all-time king. There\u2019ll never be anything like it. \nFirst of all, it was defective the day it was signed. You know, it\u2019s a different tax system. Theirs is a VAT tax system. Right? Look, there\u2019s a person clapping because only one person understands in this whole audience. Right? You know what I\u2019m saying. \nIt\u2019s a VAT tax system. So before we even start, if we go in or they come out, we are 17% behind their tax is almost 17%. So we\u2019re 17 \u2013 so it was a defective agreement for many years and nobody ever fixed it. So they had this huge advantage for many years because of the tax systems. \nI will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership and I will bring the auto jobs back to America and keep your remaining auto jobs in Ohio. Believe me, nobody\u2019s leaving. They may leave for a different state, don\u2019t get angry at me, but we\u2019ve got to keep them in our country. We love our country. Right? \nWe will immediately begin renegotiating NAFTA \u2013 that disaster. And if we don\u2019t get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal. All right? Believe me. \nYou know, folks, it\u2019s got to be a two-way street. Right? You know, you want some coming this way. The problem is it\u2019s a one-way highway right out. \nAs part of our plan to bring back American jobs, we will lower taxes on our businesses from 35% down to 15%. We\u2019ll go from the highest to among the lowest. \nHillary Clinton wants to raise taxes on small businesses up to 45%. What a difference? You know, what a difference this is. \nAnd just thinking to myself right now, we should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump. Right? \n...Why are we having it? \nHer policies are so bad. Boy, do we have a big difference. \nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. \nWe\u2019re living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. So true. \nOhio has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by crooked Hillary. \nRemember \u2013 who was the one that said that? This guy\u2019s screaming Slick Willy. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. \nSupported by Slick Willy. I think I\u2019ll make that up. \nRemember every time you see a closed factory and before I get into this. This is too depressing. \nIs this the most fun you\u2019ll ever have? Right? Right? Being at a Trump rally. Being at a Trump rally. There\u2019s nothing better. \nAll right. Now let\u2019s get back to the closed factories. Okay? \nBut every time you see a closed factory, a wiped out community here in Ohio, the Clintons were really involved because NAFTA has been such a disaster and he signed it. \nNew Mather Metal closed its factory in Toledo and laid off 168 workers and shipped their jobs to Mexico. 2010. \nTexti Leather Corporation closed their Toledo factory and laid off 160 workers and moved their job to China and Canada in 2009. \nHoneywell\u2019s auto lights factory in Fostoria over the past 16 years has laid off and moved at least 900 jobs to Mexico. \nEmployees at Dixon Ticonderoga wowowowoo. Dixon Ticonderoga. Right? Is that the name? Who the hell cares? They\u2019re gone. I mean, who cares? \nMaybe we\u2019ll get them back. Should we try getting them back? \nSee? Now with me, they wouldn\u2019t be able to leave because whatever the hell they make, when they go to Mexico and they make their product and they want to send it back over the border and they leave us with closed plants and unemployments and Mexico gets the cash, the employment, the factories, everything. What happens is they make their products. They want to send it across. I say, \u201cNo, thank you. It\u2019s a 35% tax to get your product.\u201d Right? Right? \n35% tax. \nAnd you know what\u2019s going to happen? If I do it early enough, they\u2019re not leaving. They\u2019re not leaving. They\u2019re not going to leave. And if they do leave, we make a lot of money as a country. That\u2019s okay. But nobody\u2019s leaving. \n35% go ahead leave. We\u2019ll enjoy it very much. \nWe\u2019ve lost and I say this all the time because it\u2019s hard to believe \u2013 70,000 factories. I thought it was a typo. I thought it was 700 or 7,000. It\u2019s 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary backed disaster. \nUnder my contract, if a company wants to fire their workers, move to Mexico or other countries, and ship their products back into the United States as I said, we will put a 35% tax or tariff on those products and they will not leave. Not going to leave. \nNow, the politicians knew this. Some of them did. Some of them probably don\u2019t because they don\u2019t have any basic understanding of the way the system works. But a lot of them knew this but they\u2019re controlled by special interests. \nYou know, I\u2019ll have over $100 million invested in this campaign, meaning \u2013 oh, you know, if I don\u2019t win, I will consider that \u2013 some of these dishonest people back here. And they are among the world\u2019s most dishonest. They are disgusting. They are among the world\u2019s most dishonest people. \nBut believe it or not, some of them, they said this what we have all done together is one of the great political phenomenas. Some \u2013 Bill O\u2019Reilly said this is the single greatest political phenomenon that he\u2019s ever witnessed. Right? Right? \nThat means all the residents covered by plans from these companies will be getting cancellation notices very shortly. I\u2019m sure you look forward to that. \nIt\u2019s a catastrophic situation beyond imagination. \nRepealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on Nov. 8th. She wants to keep it. \nShe wants to keep it. We\u2019re going to repeal it. We\u2019re going to have a really great plan that\u2019s going to cost much less and be much better. \nReal change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington. \nHillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 emails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and then told the FBI she couldn\u2019t remember 39 times. \nThe Clinton crew gave more than $675,000 to the wife of the Deputy FBI Director overseeing the investigation into Hillary\u2019s illegal server. \nWe need to re-open the investigation. \nInformation came out today just a little while ago that\u2019s more devastating than anything you\u2019ve seen so far. \nWikiLeaks more information but it pertains to what they knew and it makes all of them \u2013 they\u2019re already liars but it confirms it for the 75th time. \nHillary Clinton put the office of Secretary of State up for sale, and if she got the chance, she\u2019d put the Oval Office up for sale also. \nI proposed a contract with the American voter that will end the corruption and give the government back to the people. \nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment \u2013 and you know, I\u2019ve been on that side, just so you understand. Life was a lot easier on that side. I didn\u2019t have to do this. But the day I announced \u2013 you\u2019re welcome. You\u2019re welcome. You\u2019re welcome. \nWe had to do the right thing. \nThe Washington establishment to hear and heed the words I\u2019m about to say. \nIf we win on Nov. 8th \u2013 okay, okay. You\u2019re right. When we win \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of good energy in Ohio. That I can tell you. \nYou know, I worked here very early in my career like the early years. One of the first jobs I\u2019ve ever done, I worked in Cincinnati and it was a great success. And it gave me that confidence. You know? I had a success. And it was confidence, and I love Ohio. Always have. \nSo when we win, we are going to Washington D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. \nYou know, that phrase started about a week ago, and I thought it was terrible. I didn\u2019t like it at all. I said, I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t like it. And now it\u2019s become one of the hottest phrases anywhere in the world, I like it. \nThat\u2019s like did you ever see the great singers \u2013 Frank Sinatra. Some of his greatest hits, he didn\u2019t like them. But at the end, he liked them very much. Right? \nIt\u2019s what happened with drain the swamp. It\u2019s a great phrase. But it\u2019s true. The people like it. That\u2019s much more important. \nWow! What a nice group. Thank you! Thank you. Thank you! What a nice group. That\u2019s a big group. \nWe\u2019re having some awfully big groups. Thank you everybody. Thank you. \nIn 12 days we are going to win Ohio and we are going to win back the White House. Believe me. \nA brand new poll just came out. Remington Research has us up 4 points in Ohio. \nEarly voting is underway so make sure you get out and vote. Right? \nThis is amazing. All \u2013 no matter where we go, we have these massive crowds. We just left one that was 11,000. We just \u2013 it\u2019s been amazing the receptivity. \nThere\u2019s never been anything like this in this country. But you have to get out and vote because otherwise \u2013 always. \nWe\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win big. I think we\u2019re going win a lot bigger than people even understand. You know what I mean. A lot bigger. \nWe\u2019re tired of stupidity and we\u2019re tired of incompetence, and we\u2019re going to run it properly, and that\u2019s what we want. \nWe want to make America great again, folks. Very simple. \n75% of the American people think our country is on the wrong track. Who are the other 25% just out of curiosity? Who are the 25%? \nWe\u2019re going to fix it and we\u2019re going to get our country back on the right track. \nReal change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. What a mess. \nIt never worked from day one. It was never destined to work. There was no way it was ever going to work and I said before they voted. I said that\u2019s never going to work. \nIt has just been announced that Americans are going to experience a massive double-digit hike in Obamacare premiums, including a 116% premium hike in the great state of Arizona. \nThink of that. \nDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not going to be so far behind. Don\u2019t worry. \nIt\u2019s a mess. It\u2019s a mess. It\u2019s going up in numbers like you wouldn\u2019t believe. \nJust so you understand, Hillary Clinton is going to double down double up. She wants that thing. She\u2019s going to spend so much money. But you\u2019re going to spend more money. \nYou\u2019re right. Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is the craziest thing in the world. \u201cCraziest thing in the world\u201d where the people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. \nJob-killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged. \nHillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, destroying American health care forever and destroying businesses forever because you see what it\u2019s doing to businesses small and big. \nJust this year, crooked Hillary declared that Obamacare is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country. \nCan you imagine \u2013 I just standing here saying can you believe this? Can you imagine if that\u2019s one of your greatest accomplishments as president? And it\u2019s a disaster. \nAnd by the way, we\u2019re going to repeal it but it\u2019s going to die of its own weight. It can\u2019t make it anyway. \nThe insurance companies are all leaving. They\u2019re fleeing. \nHere in Ohio, another 5 insurance companies are dropping out of Obamacare. You\u2019ll have nobody to negotiate with. Just one maybe and that\u2019s a tough negotiation. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania", "text": "They come back. Look at what happened in San Francisco. Five times he came back. On the fifth time, he killed Kate [Steinle]. Five times. But so many others \u2013 one 10 times came back. Killed somebody after 10 times. \nWhen they get deported, they stay out. Otherwise, they have very serious prison terms. They will stay out. Once you do that, they will stay out. \nRight now, they have no consequence. They have no consequences. \nAlso reforms on visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. \nNumber eight, restoring community safety act reduces surging crimes, drugs, and violence by creating a task force on violent crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist your local police, who are doing such a great job. Believe me. \nIncrease the resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars or out of our country and into the country where they came from. \nRestoring national security act, which rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester, which has been very tough on our military, and expanding military investment. \nNow, at no time practically do we need a military like right now. We don\u2019t want to use it. But it\u2019s peace through strength. We need a strong military. Our military is so terribly depleted. \nIt also provides our great veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend a private doctor of their choice. \nIf they\u2019re waiting on line \u2013 and I have the plan up and we\u2019ve gotten as you know tremendous support from veterans, from law enforcement, from veterans, from the military. Tremendous support. \nBut if they\u2019re waiting on line, and you see it \u2013 22 suicides a day. People don\u2019t even believe it. 22 a day. But if they\u2019re waiting on line for seven days, six days, nine days, they can\u2019t get to see a doctor and a simple procedure or a simple prescription can solve their problem and they become very sick and they die. They die waiting in line. \nWe\u2019re going to give them the power to go across the street to a local doctor, a private doctor, a public hospital or a private hospital, all looking to help and all looking to do business. And we\u2019ll pay the bill. So much cheaper but much more importantly, the veterans will finally be taken care of properly because what they\u2019re going through now is unacceptable. \nAlso, we\u2019re going to protect our vital infrastructure from the new thing \u2013 it\u2019s called cyber attack. \nIt establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values. \nWe want people that love our country or can love our country and people that will love our citizens. We want people that can love us. \nAnd there are ways through talent of determining that, and countries do but we don\u2019t. Just come on in, folks. Come on in. \nClean up corruption in Washington act enacts tough new ethic reforms to reduce the corrupting influence of special interests and donors on our politics. \nOn Nov. 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our country, secure our communities, and honesty to our government. \nThis is my pledge to you, and if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by, and for the people. \nAnd importantly, we will make America great again. Believe me. \nThank you. Thank you. \nAnd yet, by far, per pupil more money than anybody and it\u2019s not even close. We spend more money per pupil than anybody. Not even close. We\u2019re at the bottom of the list. Other countries spending far less per pupil are at the top of the list. \nSo obviously, our current system is not working. We will change it and we will make it good. \nIt expands vocational and technical education, which we\u2019ve totally forgotten about in this country, and make two and four year colleges more affordable. \nHave you ever gone to school and you\u2019ve been with people who aren\u2019t good students but they can fix and engine or they can build a wall or they can do things you wouldn\u2019t even think about? Because we can use some of the ones who build the wall. We\u2019re going to need them. We\u2019re going to need them. \nBut did you ever see that? How they\u2019re genius at fixing a car. They can do anything. But history? Not so good. Physics? Not so good. \nWe have to open vocational again. Those are the people. These are great people. \nThe repeal and replace Obamacare act. Fully repeal Obamacare and replace it with health savings accounts. And we can do that. The health savings account \u2013 it\u2019s one way \u2013 there are numerous ways. But this is one very good way. \nThe ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, which we have to do because that\u2019s competition. The politicians won\u2019t let go of it because the insurance companies, they don\u2019t want competition. But we\u2019ll open it up. Believe me. We\u2019ll get rid of that. I\u2019ve been saying it for years. And let states manage Medicaid funds. It will be so good. \nReforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA. There are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. \nThey\u2019re looking at drugs that are looking very good and you have terminal patients. That it\u2019s over. These people. They\u2019re dying. They want to get the drug. They won\u2019t be living much longer. And we study it for years and years. \nAt some point, they have to do what they have to do. They have to do it properly. But we have 4,000 different drugs and products waiting in line for approval and we can\u2019t get them approved. We\u2019re going to speed up that process very significantly. \nAffordable child care and elder care act allows Americans to deduct child care and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site \u2013 so important \u2013 child care services. And you see that with a couple of companies and it\u2019s such a great thing to see. And creates tax-free dependent care savings accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. So good. \nEnd illegal immigration act fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border. Don\u2019t worry about it. Remember, I said Mexico is paying for the wall. With the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall. Okay? \nWe\u2019re going to have the wall. Mexico\u2019s going to pay for the wall. Mexico\u2019s \u2013 by the way, I met with the president of Mexico 2.5 months ago. Wonderful meeting. Wonderful person. But I told him it\u2019s a two-way highway, not a one-way highway. We have our people. We have to take care of our people. We have to protect our people. So it\u2019s got to be a two way street. Otherwise, it\u2019s going to be a whole different deal. \nBut it establishes a two-year mandatory minimum prison sentences if people coming in illegally for illegally re-entering the United States after a previous deportation and a five-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions, or two or more prior deportations. \nSo when somebody comes in, we send them out. They come back in. They go to prison for quite a while. They come back. They come back again? They go five years. Because what\u2019s happening is they\u2019re coming back 10 times, and I could go case after case. \nMiddle class tax relief and simplification act, an economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% a year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. \nWe need that so badly. Jobs. We need jobs. Our jobs have left us. Our good jobs have really left us. \nThe largest tax reductions are for the middle class, who have been forgotten. It\u2019s called the forgotten man and woman. They have been forgotten. \nThe middle class with family of two children will get basically approximately a 35% tax cut and that\u2019s what they can use and that money will go back into the economy. \nThe current number of brackets will be reduced from seven to three, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. \nThe business rate will be lowered from 35% to 15% and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10% rate. \nIt\u2019s stuck. We can\u2019t bring it back \u2013 $2.5 trillion to $5 trillion. Companies can\u2019t get it back into the country. \nSome companies are actually leaving not only because taxes are so high but because they can\u2019t get their money. And they are actually leaving to get their money. \nWe are going to simplify that. We\u2019re going to have them bring the money back into our country and use the money and spend the money on building our country. \nEnd the offshoring act, establish tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate to other countries and ship their products back to the United States tax free. \nThey leave the United States like Carrier, like Ford, like so many others. They leave the United States. They fire all of their employees. They go to Mexico or another country. They build a beautiful brand new plant. They hire other people. They then take their air conditioners, their cars, whatever they\u2019re making, they send it tax free across what will be a very strong border. Believe me. But they send it tax free across the border and what do we end up with? We have unemployment, tremendous losses, and we have none of the benefits. \nSo we will establish tariffs that when they do that, there will be consequences. We\u2019ll work with them. We\u2019ll be nice. We\u2019ll be fair. But there has to be consequences. \nAnd when they know there are consequences, our companies will stop leaving the United States and going to other countries. \nThe American infrastructure act leverages public private partnerships and private investments through tax incentives to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over the next 10 years. \nOur infrastructure is in such trouble. We\u2019ve doubled our national debt to $20 trillion under President Obama. \nIn less than 8 years, $10 trillion has been added. Think of it. And we haven\u2019t fixed anything. We haven\u2019t fixed anything. \nWhat have we done? Our roads are broken. Our bridges, our tunnels, our hospitals, our schools. \nAnd we have $20 trillion in debt \u2013 all time high. \nThat\u2019s true. Our VA hospitals are in bad shape and our VA is in very, very bad shape. And we will fix that. We are going to work on fixing that because our veterans have not been treated properly. \nWe have illegal immigrants that are treated far better in many instances than our veterans and we\u2019re not going to have that. \nSchool choice and education opportunity act redirects education dollars to give parents the right to send their kids, their children, to public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home schools of their choice. \nAnd so importantly, we\u2019re going to end Common Core and bring education supervision to local communities. \nWe do so badly on education. If you look at the lists and you see Sweden, Norway, Denmark, different countries at the top, you see us at the bottom.            \nFifth, very importantly, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas, and clean coal. And we will put our miners back to work. \nSixth, I will lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks that allowed this vital energy infrastructure projects to go forward. We have roadblocks like you have never ever seen \u2013 environmental blocks, structural blocks. We\u2019re going to allow the Keystone Pipeline and so many other things to move forward. Tremendous number of jobs and good for our country. \nWe\u2019re going to cancel billions in payments to the United Nations\u2019s climate change programs and use them to fix America\u2019s water and environmental infrastructure. We\u2019re paying billions and billions and billions of dollars. We\u2019re going to fix our own environment. \nAdditionally on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and constitutional rule of law. We have to do that. \nCancel every unconstitutional executive action memorandum and order issued by President Obama. \nSecond, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia, whose wife by the way has a Trump sign. His wife is a phenomenal woman. Has a Trump sign in her front yard. Isn\u2019t that nice? I just found that out this morning. Boom. Isn\u2019t that nice? He was great. \nFrom one of the 20 judges on my list. You know we\u2019re going to make great decisions from 20 outstanding judges on a list that we submitted who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \nThird, we will cancel all federal funding of sanctuary cities. \nFourth, we will begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country. These are drug dealers, gang heads, gang members, killers. And cancel visas to foreign countries that won\u2019t taken them back. \nAnd when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and they had someone who was bad \u2013 really bad \u2013 and they brought him back to the country and the country wouldn\u2019t take him, she said, \u201cWell, bring him back. We don\u2019t want to force the country to take him.\u201d \nThere won\u2019t be one such instance if I become president. Believe me. \nWe\u2019re going to suspend immigration from terror prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. \nAnd if you look at Syria and the migration, we\u2019re taking in thousands and thousands of people into our country. We have no idea who they are, what their thought process is, where do they come from. And Hillary Clinton wants to increase the number of those thousands and thousands currently pouring in by 550%. \nRadical Islamic terror is right around the corner. We have to be so tough, so smart, so vigilant. We can\u2019t allow that to happen. We have enough problems. \nAll vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. We will be very careful. \nNext, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my administration. \nBut it will be fair trade and it will be real. \nMy security plan \u2013 so important. They\u2019ve taken the jobs from us. \nMy security plan will bring safety to our poorest communities. \nMy ethics plan will end the corruption in our government. \nWe will \u2013 corruption is massive. We will drain the swamp in Washington D.C. and replace it with a new government of, by, and for the people. Believe me. \nThat is why I have chosen Gettysburg to unveil this contract. \nI\u2019m asking the American people to rise above the noise and the clutter of our broken politics and to embrace that great faith and optimism that has always been the central ingredient in the American character. And there\u2019s nothing better or stronger than the American character. \nI am asking the American people to dream big once again. \nWhat follows is my 100 day action plan to make America great again. \nIt\u2019s a contract between Donald J. Trump and the American voter, and it begins with bringing honesty, accountability, and change to Washington D.C. \nTherefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington. \nFirst, a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. \nSecond, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition, exempting military, public safety, and public health. \nThird, a requirement that for every new federal regulation two existing regulations must be eliminated. Regulations are killing our country and our jobs. \nFourth, a five-year ban on White House and congressional officials from becoming lobbyists after they leave government service making a fortune. \nFifth, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. \nSixth, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. It\u2019s what\u2019s happening. \nOn the same day, I will begin taking \u2013 really taking strongly \u2013 seven actions to protect American workers. \nOur American workers have been treated so badly by politicians that don\u2019t have their interests at heart. And we\u2019re going to change that and we\u2019re going to change that very, very fast. \nFirst, I will announce my intention to totally renegotiate NAFTA \u2013 one of the worst deals our country has ever made signed by Bill Clinton \u2013 or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205. \nSecond, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 a potential disaster for our country. \nThird, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator. China is a currency manipulator. What they have done to us by playing currency is very sad. And I don\u2019t blame them. They\u2019ve been very smart. I blame our politicians for letting this take place. So easy to stop. So easy to stop. \nFourth, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. trade representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately. \nThe events never happened. Never. \nAll of these liars will be sued after the election is over. \nBut a simple phone call placed to the biggest newspapers or television networks gets them wall-to-wall coverage with virtually no fact-checking whatsoever. \nHere is why this is relevant to you. \nIf they can fight somebody like me, who has unlimited resources to fight back, just look at what they can do to you, your jobs, your security, your education, your health care, the violation of religious liberty, the theft of your Second Amendment, the loss of your factories, your homes, and much more. \nLook at what they\u2019ve done to you with your jobs. \nIt has just been learned on video that the violent protests at some of my rallies like in Chicago where police and others were seriously hurt \u2013 You saw that. Blood pouring down their face \u2013 were caused by paid \u2013 paid \u2013 DNC and Clinton campaign operatives. \nNow, we didn\u2019t know this. We didn\u2019t know this. This just came out two days ago on tape. We didn\u2019t know this. We were amazed at the level of violence. \nThese were paid operatives. Paid by the DNC and probably the Clinton campaign. \nThis is a criminal act. Policemen were badly hurt and so were many others. And these people should be prosecuted. \nBut because of the rigged system, they probably won\u2019t be. \nJust like we found out about these paid violent protesters, it was probably the DNC and the Clinton campaign that put forward these liars with their fabricated stories. But we\u2019ll find out about their involvement at a later date through litigation, and I look so forward to doing that. \nThe rigging of the system is designed for one reason \u2013 to keep the corrupt establishment and special interests in power at your expense and at everybody\u2019s expense. \nI have no special interest but you \u2013 the American voter. \nI didn\u2019t have to do this. Believe me. There\u2019s nothing easy about it. \nBut I had to do it. I love our country. I love the people of our country, and I felt I had to do it. \nOne thing we all know is that we will never solve our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place. \nHillary Clinton is not running against me. She\u2019s running against change. And she\u2019s running against all of the American people and all of the American voters. \nWe now find ourselves at that very special fork in the road. \nDo we repeat the mistakes of the past or do we choose to believe that a great future \u2013 yet unwritten \u2013 still lies ahead for us and for our wonderful, beloved country? I think it does. I know it does. \nMy economic plan will deliver at least 25 million jobs in one decade. \nNow, our jobs have been taken away. They\u2019ve gone to Mexico. They\u2019ve gone to so many other countries. It\u2019s a one-lane highway where they get the jobs, they get the factories, they get the money, and we get the drugs and we get the unemployment and it\u2019s going to change. Believe me. It\u2019s going to change fast. \nAnd that goes for all countries. \nWhen you look at China, when you look at every country, every trade deal we have is horrible and we should be ashamed of what people and the people that let those deals happen. They\u2019re defective and they knew they were defective and they were done for a reason. And believe me, they will be unwound so fast. \nAnd we will have trade. We will have great trade and it will be free trade. \nBut the FBI and the Justice Department covered up her crimes, which included lying to the FBI and Congress on numerous occasions and included saying \u201cI do not recall\u201d to the FBI on 39 separate times. \nShe recalls everything else but 39 separate times, she said \u201cI do not recall\u201d. Well, that\u2019s a lie also. \nThen there\u2019s the deletion of at least 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress. That\u2019s after receiving the subpoena. \nAs an example, it was announced this week that the highly respected four star general James Cartwright may be sentenced to up to five years in prison with a massive fine for lying on one occasion to the FBI, and he said he did that for national security reasons. Highly respected man. A four star general. Just took place two days ago. How must he feel? \nA big part of the rigging of this election is the fact that Hillary is being allowed to run despite having broken so many laws on so many different occasions. Why is she allowed to run? \nThe dishonest mainstream media is also part and a major part of this corruption. \nThey\u2019re corrupt. They lie and fabricate stories to make a candidate that is not their preferred choice look as bad and even dangerous as possible. \nAt my rallies, they never show or talk about the massive crowd size and try to diminish all of our events. \nOn the other hand, they don\u2019t show the small size of Hillary\u2019s crowd but in fact talk about how many people are there. Very small crowds. You know it. They know it. Everybody knows it. \nOver the last two days, three highly respected national polls said we\u2019re in first place. \nAnd one of those pollster was the most accurate poll on the last two cycles. But the media refuses to even say it or put that word out. They refuse to talk about it. \nThey\u2019re trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people. \nAs an example of the power structure I\u2019m fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN \u2013 a deal we will not approve in my administration because it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few. \nLikewise, Amazon, which through its ownership, controls the Washington Post, should be paying massive taxes but it\u2019s not paying. And it\u2019s a very unfair playing field and you see what that\u2019s happening and what that\u2019s doing to department stores all over the country. \nVery, very unfair. And you\u2019re talking about billions and billions of dollars they should be paying those taxes. \nAdditionally, Comcast\u2019s purchase of NBC concentrates far too much power in one massive entity that is trying to tell the voters what to think and what to do. \nDeals like this destroy democracy. \nAnd we\u2019ll look at breaking that deal up and other deals like that. \nThis should never ever have been approved in the first place. They\u2019re trying to poison the mind of the American voter. \nEvery woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign. Total fabrication. \nThank you very much. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. \nThank you. Please sit down. Thank you. Thank you. \nIt\u2019s my privilege to be here in Gettysburg, hollow ground where so many lives were given in service to freedom. Amazing place. \nPresident Lincoln served in a time of division like we\u2019ve never seen before. It is my hope that we can look at his example to heal the divisions we are living through right now. We\u2019re a very divided nation. \nI\u2019m not a politician and I\u2019ve never wanted to be a politician. Believe me. \nBut when I saw the trouble our country was in, I knew I couldn\u2019t stand by and watch any longer. \nOur country has been so good to me. I love our country. And I felt I had to act. \nI\u2019ve seen the system up close and personal for many years. I\u2019ve been a major part of it. I know how the game works in Washington and on Wall Street, and I know how they\u2019ve rigged the rules against everyday Americans. \nThe rules are rigged. \nNearly 1 in 4 Americans in their prime earning years isn\u2019t even working. \n1 in 5 households have no one with a job. 45 million Americans are on food stamps and 47 million are living in poverty. \nWe have failed our inner cities and in so doing have failed our African-American and Hispanic communities. \nWe\u2019ve misguided military adventures overseas and wars that go on forever that just cannot be won by the people that are doing it now. They don\u2019t know how to win the wars. \nAt home, we have our great veterans dying while waiting for medical care. \nChange has to come from outside our very broken system. Our system is broken. \nThe fact that Washington and the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once in a lifetime. \nThe system is totally rigged and broken. \nFirst, the issue of voter fraud. \nAccording to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate and when I say that there are such inaccuracies, it\u2019s unbelievable. \n1.8 million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting. I wonder how that happens. \n2.8 million people are registered in more than one state. \nThese are numbers, folks. These are numbers. \n14% of non-citizens are registered to vote. \nThe system is also rigged because Hillary Clinton should have been precluded from running for the presidency of the United States. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s Q&A at the Economic Club of New York", "text": "As a real estate person, I always like low interest rates, of course. \nBut I think what\u2019s going to happen is you\u2019re going to have them until Jan. 1st because Obama wants to go. He wants to play golf. And he wants to leave. He doesn\u2019t want to have any stock market disruptions. \nAnd I think the fed is being totally controlled politically. They\u2019re not raising rates. They\u2019re being controlled politically. I think they\u2019re going to be low. I don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re going to have a raise. They\u2019re going to be low until the end of the year. \nI don\u2019t think Obama wants to go out this way. It shouldn\u2019t be working this way. They shouldn\u2019t even be discussing it. \nMartin may or may not disagree with me. I think it\u2019s a terrible thing that\u2019s happening. We\u2019re doing it for political. The Fed is very political. They\u2019ve become very political like many other groups in this country. Beyond anything I would\u2019ve thought possible. \nSo I think you\u2019re going to have low interest rates until the end of the year. Maybe no increase at all. And the market will stay artificially high. And then we\u2019re going to have to see what happens after that. We\u2019re not doing the right job. \nWith all of that being said, all of my life I like low interest rates. Because I\u2019m doing this, I can\u2019t take advantage of it but that\u2019s okay. \nBut I will say it\u2019s become, the Fed, in my opinion has become very political. I don\u2019t think they would do.. I really believe if it was a political decision or a right decision they\u2019re going to go with the political decision every single time. \nH&R Block would be a disaster, okay? Because we\u2019re simplifying. How about people that go with tax? It\u2019s so complicated. You\u2019d need 180 IQ to understand it. \nAnd people that frankly are making a small amount of money, they have to go and they have their tax return done by people. \nAnd by the way, when they\u2019re done you\u2019ll have 10 different tax people and you\u2019ll have 10 different answers to the same person. The whole thing is crazy. \nSo that would be one industry that wouldn\u2019t do well. \n...So, I can tell you an industry that will do well, and an industry that we can use, I know prices are low now but when prices go up, is the energy industry. \nWe have amazing people in that industry and they are just being decimated. They are being absolutely decimated. And energy is salt work. \nAnd we found out because of new technology whether it\u2019s fracking or many other things, we\u2019re sitting on top of our land, it\u2019s turned out to be \u2013 we have more than just about anybody in the world. Our land has turned out to be so valuable because of what\u2019s underneath. \nWe have to be careful. We have to be very environmentally sound. That\u2019s very important. \nBut it\u2019s incredible when you look at what\u2019s happened in the last 5 years. We can be self-sufficient, which we have to be, otherwise we\u2019ll be stuck in the Middle East forever. \nAnd we have to get out of that war. We have to knock out ISIS. I didn\u2019t want to be in that war. But I wasn\u2019t a politician. Nobody really cared. But I didn\u2019t want to be in the war. But we have no choice. The way they got out was bad, to get out so quickly and not leave anybody behind. \nISIS developed. We have to knock out ISIS. \nYou see the atrocities they committed. Yesterday, I guess it was 22 or 24 people hung from racks of a slaughter house like a slaughter house and then their throats cut. I mean can you imagine this? Nobody has ever heard of things like this before. \nAnd then we talk about water boarding. It\u2019s an incredible thing. No, it\u2019s incredible. \nWe\u2019re not playing on the same playing field. \nBut if you look at the atrocities committed just yesterday with the meat hooks, we have no choice but to totally decimate ISIS. We have to do it. We have to do it rapidly. We have no choice. \nAnd then we have to get back to building our country, folks. We have to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. We have to rebuild our country because it\u2019s a mess. \nTrack record, great competence, love of what they\u2019re doing, how they\u2019re getting along with people, references. I mean no different than when you\u2019re running a company how you hire top people. It would be no different. \nThe government, you need people with heart, also. You know it\u2019s probably the one thing you need in government that they don\u2019t have in business quite as much. But you need some some but not a lot. \nBut you need people that are truly, truly capable. \nAnd you need, and I think so much has to do with past history. How they\u2019ve done. How\u2019s it all worked at. You understand what I mean by that perhaps better than anybody. And we have to get the best people. \nWe can longer be so politically correct. \nYou know we do things today, we\u2019re so politically correct. People are afraid to walk. They\u2019re afraid to talk. They can\u2019t speak. They\u2019re afraid they\u2019re going to say the wrong word and they\u2019ll be shunned from society. \nDon\u2019t worry. It only lasts about a week if that happens. It\u2019s not that bad. \nBut we have to stop being so politically correct. \nWe need to get the best and the finest, and if we don\u2019t, we\u2019ll be in trouble for a long period of time. And maybe never come out of it. \nI honestly believe, and I\u2019m not saying this because it\u2019s myself, this is the last time. This going to be the last election we have a chance to make this country great again. To really make it wealthy again. Make it strong again. Make it, you know, all of the things that we want to see. We have to have. \nBut I really believe this is the most important election that we\u2019ve been involved in, you know, for many many many many years. Many decades. And because it\u2019s going down. \nThe Supreme Court justices that I told you about before. I mean if they put certain people onto the Supreme Court, our country is going to be a whole different country. We\u2019re going to be a large-scale version Venezuela. We\u2019re going to be a totally different deal, and this is the last chance that, in my opinion, our country has to really get better, to get well. \nAnd I just think this election is so important, not because of me, but because of the ideas. The ideas that we have. The ideas that we need to do what have to do. \nBut I think it\u2019s going to be a very, very important election and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing such enthusiasm. \nYou know we go make a speech, John, and we have people showing up 25,000 people show up and 30,000 people. And we announced one day. \nWe had one in Pensacola the other day. We had this massive tens of thousands of people showed up. We announced like a day and a half before this speech on Twitter. We don\u2019t even take ads. \nPeople want to see great things happen for this country. People really love this country. The people of this country really love this country. \nEven other countries want to see great things happen because it\u2019s so important. \nSo, I just think this is going to be the most important election that we\u2019ve had for many, many decades, and I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re going to have second chance at it. \n...We have the greatest negotiators of the world.  We have to use. \nWhen China enters that negotiation, they come in with 20 people that are the toughest, smartest, meanest. They don\u2019t say, \u201cGood morning. Isn\u2019t it a lovely day? Isn\u2019t it wonderful? How did the Yankees do last night?\u201d There\u2019s no talk. It\u2019s like we get down to business.  Boom!  No games.  \nWe put people in there that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.  Because this is why we have deficits of $500 billion with one country.  \nWe rebuilt China, and I say that with great respect for China. I have a great relationship with China.  \nThey used to tell me before I was running that they can\u2019t \u2013 I have many friends from China.  The biggest people, the richest people. They cannot believe what China gets away with.  They said we cannot believe it.  \nBut then when I announced I was running for president, they called, \u201cOh I didn\u2019t really mean that.\u201d  They didn\u2019t know this was going to happen.  \nBut in the good old days, they would tell me, \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that. Your government is stupid.\u201d  \nBut now they deny they\u2019ve ever said that. \nWell, I\u2019d go back to the heads of the various groups agencies, you know, all of the different parcels of government, and I would be putting very, very top people into negotiate. We don\u2019t do that.  \nHonestly, we put political people in to negotiate. We put people in that gave contributions. We put people in that, you know, work the system. We put people in that shouldn\u2019t be there.  \nAnd when you say can you cut 1% off your budget, they look like this is impossible when they are people in this room because I know a couple of them. They\u2019re total killers. I won\u2019t call them out. They hear 1%. They say that I can do it all in one year. I can get it down to 25% in one year. Maybe more.  I say take it easy, just relax.  \nBut there are people in this room that would say that.  \nSo you know when you hear, 1% a year for ten years; that\u2019s a massive difference, 1% a year for ten years. \nSo, I would really have it done at the level of the group running whatever individual thing within government that their running.  They will be able to do it if we have the right people.  We don\u2019t have the right people.  \nWe have people that shouldn\u2019t be doing what they\u2019re doing.  We have people that have people under them that are far, far more competent than they are.  And those people lose respect for the system when they see what\u2019s coming, and I can\u2019t tell you how strongly I believe this.  \nThe trade deals are so bad.  NAFTA has destroyed our country.  NAFTA has destroyed the manufacturing leg of our country.  \nYou look at places like upstate New York where they lost 40% of their manufacturing.  And they\u2019re going to lose a lot more before it\u2019s done.  \nDon\u2019t forget, Hillary Clinton\u2019s said when she was running for the Senate that she\u2019s going to bring jobs back to New York.  She meant New York but Upstate New York.  Upstate New York, out on Long Island.  You look at things that are happening and it\u2019s unbelievable.  Building after building that\u2019s empty. She didn\u2019t bring anything. They left. They all left.  \nSo, when we negotiate great trade deals, and we don\u2019t even including that to a large extent in the numbers that we\u2019re giving you.  \nBut when we take NAFTA and make it a two-way highway not a one way, so that, yes, things go out and we have at least equal and I mean at least because we have a lot of things catching up to do.  They have absolutely stripped this country of its manufacturing jobs and jobs.  And companies have destroyed companies.  Thousands and thousands of companies, millions of jobs.  \nWe\u2019re going to get that back.  We\u2019re going to get that back. \nSo whenever I talk about tax cutting and I talk about balancing, a big part of that is we\u2019re going to have great trade deals.  He would be a man to negotiate; I think I will put him in charge of China.  \nNow, there is some areas where you could buy back debt. I don\u2019t know. Somebody put that out. I said buy back debt. \nYou know this isn\u2019t like you\u2019re building a real estate project and the market crashes and you have your shot at a bank. I love those days, you know? I love that. \nSomebody said I\u2019m one of the great in the world at that. I love, you know, I love buying back debt. I love negotiating debt. \nBut with the United States you\u2019re talking about something beyond a gold standard. \nNow the interest is down, but you can buy back, we\u2019re not talking at discount. You can discount. You can do things. But no, the debt of this country is absolutely sacred. Absolutely 100% sacred. You have to do it. \n...We think and hopefully beyond that eventually with time this is going to work out. Absolutely. \nBut the big things, in terms of neutrality, is going to be the amount of business that we generate. The fact that companies are no longer going to be leaving. \nI mean, you have to look at the list of companies. \nI told you just before that Ford Motor Company, this is a massive amount of business they\u2019re taking. Their small cars, all small cars, they\u2019re going to make them in Mexico. \nIt\u2019s like, you know, it\u2019s a story in a newspaper, but it\u2019s devastating for Michigan and areas of the country that have to go through this. \nWe\u2019re going to keep our companies here. \nOur companies are leaving us because taxes are so high. \nOur companies are leaving us because they can\u2019t bring their money back in. \nOur companies are leaving us because of regulation. The regulation is so massive that our companies are leaving us. \nSo, I think we\u2019re going to, number one we\u2019re going to keep companies here. They\u2019re not going to be leaving anymore because now they have a better deal than where they\u2019re looking to go. But importantly, we\u2019re also coupling that with cutting costs. Cutting budgetary costs and lots of costs. There will be many costs that we\u2019re going to be cutting. \nAnd we\u2019re going to be enhanced by certain things like...with the military and the defense of other countries which a lot of people didn\u2019t even know. \nI don\u2019t think too many people knew even this room until I started speaking about it a year ago. I don\u2019t think a lot of people knew that we defend, as an example, Germany or Japan. \nYou pretty much knew South Korea and we\u2019re defending South Korea. You know Saudi Arabia as an example. Saudi Arabia, we know. Lots of wealth. Lots of money. \nThey don\u2019t pay us very much for what we do. \nAnd you know you could ask yourself, \u201cHow long would Saudi Arabia even be there if we weren\u2019t defending them?\u201d \nAnd I think we should defend them, but we have to be compensated properly for that defense. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be thrilled to hear that. \nA lot of that has to do with the cutting because we\u2019re going to be cutting costs also. As part of our tax plan, we have to cut costs. \nBut, I think we\u2019re going to unleash something that\u2019s going to be so amazing and a lot of it\u2019s competition. \nYou look at Ireland being just about the lowest, a little bit lower. So, we\u2019re not the lowest, but we\u2019re getting down there. \nBut right now, essentially we\u2019re the highest in the world, certainly of the industrialized countries. \nAnd we set it from a competitor\u2019s standpoint and we added to that, and very importantly added to that the cutting, the cost cutting. And there\u2019s tremendous fat. \nYou know, it\u2019s interesting when all of us, so many in the room do this, but when we buy companies, we like to buy companies that are poorly run, right? Because we can have so much room to cut. We don\u2019t want to buy a perfectly running machine where we can\u2019t do too much. \nWell, we\u2019re not a perfectly running machine. We have tremendous waste, tremendous fraud, tremendous abuse. \nOur military orders equipment that frankly, it\u2019s ordered, I say politically motivated. Because they\u2019ll buy equipment that\u2019s not as good as the equipment they want and the equipment they want, that the generals want, is better and it\u2019s less expensive. \nWe have so many things we can do if we do it properly. \nAnd you know, my whole theme has been,\u201dMake America Great Again.\u201d We\u2019re going to make America great again. \nI think that. I watch the world, and I look at China and other countries. And if China goes down with GDP to 7% or even 8%, it\u2019s like they\u2019ll have a revolution. \nAnd then what do they do? They start devaluing, devaluing. They do of all sorts of things, and they get it back on track one way or the other. \nAnd I\u2019ve had friends come to me that have been devastated. People that are manufacturers, that are great manufacturers, very successful people, but they\u2019ve become less and less successful because they can\u2019t beat the system. And in this way, too, it\u2019s a rigged system. \nAnd they\u2019re almost doing well and then, boom, there\u2019s a massive devaluation in China or other countries. \nAnd there are plenty of other countries out there. Some are actually hurting China now. \nBut the fact is that when they have 7% and you see it where they start dropping 7% or 8%, they consider that to be a disaster. And yet we\u2019re stuck at 1%. Probably the real number is 1% but certainly no more than 2%, and we try and learn to live with it. We can\u2019t do that anymore. \nSo we\u2019re going to unleash a tremendous opportunity that we\u2019re bringing back the trillions of dollars that doesn\u2019t come into this country. And that does really, I said in my remarks that does really bring a lot of companies out. They go to get their money. They leave. Not even because taxes are too high. They leave to get to heir money. \nSo, we\u2019re going to unleash a lot. We\u2019re going to unleash a lot with the regulations. \nI\u2019ll tell you the thing that most surprised me in going around, because I\u2019ve been to, I mean, I\u2019ve been everywhere. I have been working. This started on June 16th. Who knew this was going to happen, right? But it started on June 16 and it\u2019s been an amazing thing. \nBut what truly amazed me from a business standpoint. I speak to big businesses. The biggest businesses in the world. But I also speak to the small business people and the farmers. If they had their choice between this massive tax cut from 35% down to 15% or regulation relief, they would take almost 100% of the time regulation relief. \nThe regulations are a disaster. They\u2019re killing people. They\u2019re killing the farmers. They\u2019re killing the energy folks. They\u2019ve killed the mines. \nAnd you know we all believe there\u2019s to be regulation for safety, for environment, for certain reasons. But it is gone so crazy and it\u2019s gotten excessive, but they would take that over taxes. \nSo, we\u2019re going to unleash a tremendous number of jobs coming in. \nPlus, we\u2019re going to have great cutting. Waste, fraud, abuse. But think of that word \u201cwaste.\u201d \nI mean, with the Penny Plan. Just a penny out of every dollar. Now, I know you can do that very easily. But we have to appoint to head these massive massive agencies you know, if they were companies they\u2019d be, rather large companies, they\u2019d be up there with the biggest . Some would be bigger than any of the other companies. \nBut you take a penny, a penny, off the dollar and you do that for a number of years and all of sudden really great things start to happen. \nIn addition to that, we spend a tremendous amount on military, which we\u2019re going to increase. We have no choice. \nBut we also defend other countries. And those countries are not paying us nearly what they should be paying us. We\u2019re losing tremendous, billions and billions of dollars on defending other people. Some of whom don\u2019t even appreciate the fact that we\u2019re defending them. And many of them don\u2019t pay us. They don\u2019t pay us. They don\u2019t pay us. I say why because you know, they don\u2019t ask. We don\u2019t ask. \nSo, those countries I\u2019m sure will start to pay for the defense, but it\u2019s a fantastic, it\u2019s a fantastic number. It\u2019s a very, very large, it\u2019s a shocking number. It\u2019s a shocking number. \nI will just finish with saying this. I have great respect for Japan. But as you know, we defend Japan. We defend Germany. We defend Saudi Arabia. We defend South Korea. We have 28,000 soldiers right now South Korea. These are economic behemoths. Behemoths. \nThese are wealthy countries and when I said they have to pay more, a general came to refute my statement and said, \u201cDoesn\u2019t Mr. Trump know that Japan pays 50% of the cost of its defense?\u201d And I said, \u201cAh, why don\u2019t they pay 100%?\u201d \nThe numbers you\u2019re talking about are massive, and when you add it all together, a lot of good things are going to happen.

You can\u2019t say tonight that you can make that pledge? \nBut \u2013 and I am discussing it with everybody but I\u2019m talking about a lot of leverage. We want to win, and we will win. But I want to win as the Republican. I want to run as the Republican nominee. \nQuestion:\nSo tonight, you can\u2019t say if another another one of these \u2013 \nRand Paul:\nThis is what\u2019s wrong. This is what\u2019s wrong.

So if he doesn\u2019t run as a Republican, maybe he supports Clinton or maybe he runs as an independent. \nBut I say he\u2019s already hedging his bets because he\u2019s used to buying politicians. \nQuestion:\nJust to be clear...you\u2019re not going to make the pledge tonight? "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks on Brexit", "text": "Question:\n[On Trump being the chief benefactor of Brexit]\n \nI think that \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to end up being a great thing and the beautiful, beautiful, beautiful thing is your people have taken the country back and there\u2019s something very, very nice about that. And they\u2019ve voted and it\u2019s been peaceful. And it was strong and very contentious. And in many respects, I watched last night, it was a little bit ugly. But it\u2019s been an amazing process to watch. It\u2019s a big move. \nAnd you know, when I came here, I said, \u201cWho\u2019s going to come out here?\u201d It turned out that probably more people came out here. There\u2019s a tremendous turnout. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd I can tell you in the United States, the people want their country back. In the United States, people want smart decisions, not dumb decisions, and we\u2019ve been given dumb decisions for many years and the people are tired of it. And I have a feeling the same thing has happened over here and that\u2019s why you have the result that you had. \nI love you all. Thank you very much. And thank you to my members and thank you to the council. The council has been amazing. And thank you all for being here. Thank you. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI\u2019ve given up The Apprentice. I said I\u2019m not going to do it. Steve Burke [sp] wanted me to do, you know, years more of The Apprentice, continues to do great. I had to give it up because you\u2019re not allowed to do this, you know, with the equal time laws and provisions. You\u2019re not allowed to do it. \nI\u2019ve lost certain things, especially early on. You know, early on, I lost Macy\u2019s and I\u2019m glad to see Macy\u2019s stock tanked because they were very disloyal. But just over the subject of illegal immigration, I lost Macy\u2019s as a vendor for ties and shirts and things. It was not a big deal but it was still a loss. \nNo, this is not for brand. If I wanted to do good for my brand, I wouldn\u2019t have done this because, you know, when you \u2013 one thing about politics \u2013 everybody like me. But once you run for politics, you\u2019ll have 55 for you and 45 against. I\u2019ve never had that before. It\u2019s very interesting. \nMy wife said to me, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never heard this before. There were some crowds \u2013 some of the crowds were a little hostile.\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019ve been with you for many years and the crowds always loved you. And now you have half the crowd hostile and half the crowd loves you.\u201d \nAnd that\u2019s called politics. You know, if you run for office and you get 55% of the vote, that\u2019s considered like a landslide. That\u2019s a big, big difference. But that means that 45% of the people don\u2019t like you. \nSo for my brand, this has not been a good thing. Although I mean, look where we\u2019ve come. We started out \u2013 we were one in 17 and you know we won. We won. And I think we\u2019re going to go much further than that. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI think the borders \u2013 you know, it\u2019s not so different. It\u2019s amazing the way the world is not so different. We\u2019re on the other side of the ocean, but the world is not so different. We\u2019re right over there you go many, many miles right in that direction and to be honest with you, I think a lot of it has to do with immigration. \nBut I also think a lot of it has to do with the fact that they wanted to be independent. They get tired of seeing stupid decisions just like the American people are tired of seeing stupid decisions, whether it\u2019s the Iran deal, whether it\u2019s the border where people just flow across the border like Swiss cheese. They\u2019re tired of seeing stupid decisions made. They\u2019re tired of looking at horrible trade deals. And you have bad trade deals here too. And so I think that has a lot to do with it. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd no, they love what we\u2019ve done here. You know, this is a little bit of what we\u2019re going to do to the United States. \nYou know, the United States has rotted infrastructure. We have roads that are crumbling. \nI have a friend who\u2019s a trucker. A big trucker. One of the biggest in the world actually. And he said he buy these brand new magnificent trucks. They cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and he\u2019s never had this problem before. They\u2019re just getting destroyed because the highways are loaded with potholes. And when you have an 18-wheeler or a 16-wheeler and you have these big massive trucks and they\u2019re going down a highway at 65 miles an hour and they hit a pothole and they\u2019re loaded up with tons of stuff, he said those trucks, no matter how good they are, they get wiped out. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to our country. \nAnd I think this is sort of a mini example of what we\u2019ve done here \u2013 the members love us. Scotland loves us for what we\u2019ve done. The council \u2013 our council member here...The council has been so incredible and you know it\u2019s just been a big love fest. \nWhat we do is the United States needs its infrastructure fixed. You know, the bridges are a disaster. The roads are a disaster. \nMy friend told me, he said, he\u2019s never had a problem like this before. He said you go down the highway and a brand new truck that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars is virtually destroyed. They have to bring it back and have it re-hauled because they\u2019re hitting potholes all over the place on highways. \nOur infrastructure is crumbling in the United States, and we\u2019ve spent probably if you added up now $4 trillion \u2013 maybe more than that \u2013 in the Middle East and we have a problem. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[On whether Trump will cut ties with his business while running for president]\n \nAnd again, I\u2019m here really for the sole reason \u2013 although I did want to see the job that Eric did because if he didn\u2019t do a good job, he wouldn\u2019t be standing here right now. I would give him a hard time. Right? He did a beyond job. Beyond. This is phenomenal... \nBut no, I will absolutely cut ties. \nYou know, the rules are nobody knows. Okay? It\u2019s never had where somebody has this big a business and runs for president and wins. \nIf I win, I would \u2013 even though I don\u2019t have to do that \u2013 I would probably put everything in trust. My children will run it along with my executives. It\u2019s a big company. My children will run it along with my executives and just do a good job running it. \nLet me tell you, the importance of the opportunity that I may be given is so important and so massive \u2013 making great trade deals with China and with you folks by the way \u2013 but with China, the numbers are so staggering when you look at trade deficits of $400 billion and $500 billion a year. The numbers are so staggering and so incredible, I wouldn\u2019t even be thinking about the business. I mean, who cares? I mean, I would actually say, \u201cWho cares?\u201d \nNo, I would absolutely \u2013 you don\u2019t have to do this but I would most likely just put it in a blind trust and they would run it or something. \nQuestion:\n[On why Trump continues holding campaign events at Trump properties]\n \nAnd the other thing is why should I use somebody else\u2019s properties? Number one, it\u2019s not as good. And number two, you know, it\u2019s one of those things. \nNow, I wish frankly that I wasn\u2019t forced by law to pay myself back. We\u2019re forced to pay. You do understand that? Because a couple of people said he\u2019s paying to his campaign. I\u2019m not paying to my campaign. \nI would love to give everything for nothing. \nBut by law, I\u2019m forced \u2013 whatever the fair market value of a ballroom is or whatever it may be that we use or an airplane as an example. If I use an airplane, by law, I have to pay it back. And that\u2019s what I do and that\u2019s reflected in the filings. \nQuestion:\n[On criticizing Obama]\n \nI mean, he\u2019s constantly dictating to the world what they should do. The world doesn\u2019t listen to him obviously. You can see that by the vote. But he\u2019s constantly dictating to other countries. \nSo certainly, it doesn\u2019t stop at the water\u2019s edge with him. And you know, very importantly he got it totally wrong. And he\u2019s embarrassed. I mean, he\u2019s embarrassed by the Supreme Court decision yesterday, which was a real rebuke. And he\u2019s very embarrassed by he got involved. I don\u2019t know if that was through a friendship with David Cameron. It could have been, and I understand friendship, and I can understand why he did it. I can understand that. \nBut I think it\u2019s something he shouldn\u2019t have done. It\u2019s not his country. It\u2019s not his part of the world. He shouldn\u2019t have done it and I actually think that his recommendation perhaps caused it to fail. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd I don\u2019t know if that was the reason but we had a tremendous response to that. \nQuestion:\n[On Obama and Clinton\u2019s encouragement of UK voters to vote Remain]\n \nBut I was actually very surprised that President Obama would have come over here and he would have been so bold as to tell the people over here what to do. And I think that a lot of people don\u2019t like him and a lot of people voted. If he had not said it, I think your result might have been different. But when he said it, people were not happy about it and I thought it was totally inappropriate. \nAnd when I said what I said, I told people, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t do what I\u2019m saying necessarily. Do whatever you think but this was just my opinion.\u201d \nHe came in and really tried to convince people to stay, and I thought it was inappropriate. And then she doubled down and she did the same thing. \nAnd obviously for the 219th time, they were wrong. They\u2019re always wrong, and that\u2019s the problem with them. \nQuestion:\n[On whether Trump would support Boris Johnson as prime minister]\n \nQuestion:\n[On campaign shake-up]\n \nYou know, I say this to all the folks here that don\u2019t come from the United States I ran a campaign in the primaries where we got the largest number of votes in the history of the Republican Party primary votes. So, larger than Ronald Reagan, larger than Richard Nixon, larger than Dwight D. Eisenhower who helped win the Second World War. \nAnd we ran a very lean campaign and I had fewer people and I spent less money and I funded the money myself. I spent $55 million, I think... \nAnd by the way, I\u2019m forced \u2013 you know, legally, I have to pay myself back. In other words, if I use \u2013 this has nothing to do with the campaign. And you won\u2019t see this. This is to support my children. But if I use one of my resorts in the United States and we have a press conference or something, by law I have to pay myself back. I would like not to. I\u2019d like to just say use the ballroom and let\u2019s not bother with it because a couple of people say I pay. By law you have to pay yourself back. \nI think that we should have been given credit for, in addition to winning, for winning with less money spent and with a smaller staff. \nSo now we have a staff of 73 people. And Hillary has a staff of 900 people. I won and she won. I don\u2019t think that \u2013 I mean, honestly, as a businessman, I say, \u201cWow, he won with spending less money and a smaller staff.\u201d See, I\u2019d view that as an advantage. A lot of the pundits say, \u201cShe has a much bigger staff.\u201d Well, I think we\u2019re very nimble. I think we\u2019re very nimble. I think we\u2019re doing well. And you\u2019ve seen the polls that are coming in. They\u2019re very close and very equal. \nWe just had one coming out, I think, from West Virginia where I have a 25 point lead. And North Carolina came out yesterday, we have a 2 point lead. Ohio\u2019s even. Pennsylvania\u2019s even. \nThe national polls, we\u2019re getting very close. And I\u2019m spending much less money. She\u2019s spending tremendous amounts of money. We haven\u2019t even started yet. So it\u2019s going to be very interesting because she\u2019s spent \u2013 what was it? $28 million? I mean, she\u2019s spent a lot of money and we\u2019re even. And I think that\u2019s a good sign and I think that\u2019s a good sign. \nWhen I won New Hampshire, I spent a tiny fraction of what other candidates spent \u2013 one in particular. I won New Hampshire by a landslide. That person came in seventh. \nI think, you know, when you can do it on a smaller budget and with fewer people, that\u2019s the kind of person they want to be the president because to me that\u2019s a big thing. \nQuestion:\n[On whether Trump supports the break-up of the European Union]\n \nSo I could see it happening. I have no opinion really but I could certain see it happening. \nI saw this happening. I could read what was happening here and I could see things happening in Germany. \nI hope they straighten out the situation because you know, it can really become a nasty \u2013 it can be very nasty. What\u2019s going on can be very, very nasty. \nBuilding safe zones in Syria? Great idea. Building safe zones \u2013 magnificent, big safe as can be. But when you\u2019re taking them into the United States by the thousands \u2013 we don\u2019t know who they are \u2013 and when you\u2019re taking them into Germany and other countries. And all you have to do is look around. Look around the world. See what\u2019s happening. Some real problems. \nQuestion:\n[On using immigration to divide people]\n \nI just told you about Germany where people want to leave Germany. People that I would never in a million years have said these people want to leave. They\u2019re going to be leaving. \nSo you can\u2019t unite a country by forcing things the people\u2019s throats. And that\u2019s what happened here. People are not happy. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nBut I wanted to \u2013 really I wanted to support my children who have really poured their hearts and souls into this development. But I think you understand. \nQuestion:\n[On why Trump is in Scotland]\n \nQuestion:\n[On soliciting campaign donations]\n \nTom\u2019s asking does it bother me to \u2013 when you\u2019re raising money \u2013 and again, Tom, I\u2019m raising this money for the Republican Party. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve never done. \nI\u2019ve always contributed money to lots of people. A lot of campaign contributions over the years. And once I ran, I became like an outsider. \nBut no, I don\u2019t like doing that but I have done it and we\u2019ve had amazing weeks. \nLast week, we were in Houston. As you know, we had tremendous lines. I made a speech also and the lines were \u2013 actually on ABC they reported \u2013 ABC local \u2013 they followed the lines all the way to the highways. It was \u2013 actually I\u2019ve never seen anything like that, and then Dallas where we had a similar thing. \nBut we also had fundraisers, and I\u2019ve really never done. You know, I sit with 20 people and we talk and they all hand you checks \u2013 bing, bing, bing, bing. And they\u2019re checks to the RNC and the Republican Party and I feel like I have an obligation to do that. \nAnd Tom, the numbers are going to be, I think, quite staggering, especially in July...Don\u2019t forget, we just sort of started this process a few weeks ago and the first filing was for a very limited period of time and it was almost before we started. But the numbers are amazing. \nActually, the numbers for the small donations \u2013 we\u2019ve taken a lot of money otherwise \u2013 but the numbers for the small donations are coming in at \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s beyond anything that we thought. You know, the $25 and $50 and $100 donations. But we\u2019ll be reporting in June. \nBut especially the July report I think we\u2019ll show you some pretty massive numbers. \nQuestion:\u00a0\n[On Brexit having a negative impact on US economy]\n \nWhat I like is that I love to see people take their country back, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s happening in the United States and I think you see that. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in many other places in the world. They\u2019re tired of it. They want to take their countries back. \nYou know, this isn\u2019t such phenomenon like some people are saying. \nAnd when people ask me what I thought was going to happen, as you know, I said I think they\u2019re going to break away. And it\u2019s just turned out that way. \nAnd it was a little bit surprising because the polls indicated probably that it wouldn\u2019t happen. 80%. \nAnd when I landed this morning, the first thing I asked is that. \nAnd I mean, it was fairly close but it wasn\u2019t that close. So we\u2019ll see what happens. \nI think it\u2019ll be a good thing. You\u2019re taking your country back. You\u2019re going to let people that you want into your country, and people that you don\u2019t want or people that you don\u2019t think are going to be appropriate for your country or good for your country, you\u2019re not going to have to take. \nAnd, you know, look, Europe like the United States has made tremendous mistakes over the last period of time. \nYou look at Germany. You look at some of the things that are happening. There have been tremendous mistakes that have been made. \nSo, I think it\u2019s going to end up being a very good thing. But it\u2019ll take time. \nQuestion:\n[On whether Trump had influence over UK voters on Brexit]\n \nIf I said yes, total influence, they\u2019ll say, \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. His ego is terrible.\u201d Right? So I will never say that...I\u2019d like to give you that one but I can\u2019t say that. \nAnd you know, look, the question was what do I think and I gave my opinion a few times over the last few months. But I also said I really don\u2019t want people to listen to it because it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s about them. It\u2019s about them. It\u2019s their country. \nBut my opinion is that what happened should have happened and I think they\u2019ll end up being stronger for it and they\u2019ll control their country and they\u2019ll control everything about their country. \nQuestion:\n[On whether David Cameron should resign]\n \nQuestion:\n[On whether Trump supports Scotland\u2019s independence]\n \nAnd you know that question really has to be addressed to the people. \nIt was a very, very close vote. I don\u2019t know that people want to go through that again. \nI was here when they were going through that vote. I didn\u2019t take sides but I will tell you it was a nasty period. And I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d go through that again. But the people of Scotland may speak differently. \nQuestion:\u00a0\n[On consulting with his foreign policy advisers on Brexit]\n \nYou know, I\u2019ve been saying that I would prefer what happened. I thought this would be a good thing. I think it\u2019ll turn out to be a good thing. Maybe short-term not but ultimately I think it will be a good thing.\u00a0 \nAnd I\u2019ve actually been in touch. And some by the way don\u2019t like it and some do like it. You know, they\u2019re advisers. They\u2019re like everybody else. They probably know less \u2013 every one of these advisers.\u00a0 \nSomebody said, \u201cGee, you should use advisers that have been really hot for the last five years.\u201d I said, \u201cReally? I think I want to use ones that haven\u2019t been involved.\u201d\u00a0 \nTake a look at what\u2019s happened in the world.\u00a0 \nQuestion:\u00a0\n[On UK-US relationship post-Brexit]\n \nQuestion:\u00a0\n[On trade deal with U.S.]\n \nThe UK has been such a great ally for so long. They\u2019ll always be at the front of the line. They\u2019ve been amazing allies in good times and in bad times. And sometimes they make mistakes together, as we know, but they\u2019ve always been great allies.\u00a0 \nSo I will tell you I think that I was very surprised when I heard President Obama say that. And I think he said that because he thought for sure it was going to stay together but it didn\u2019t stay together.\u00a0 \nAnd I felt it wouldn\u2019t stay together and again I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the United States. It\u2019s not staying together, it\u2019s a really positive force taking place.\u00a0 \nThey want to take their country back. The people want their country back.\u00a0 \nWe don\u2019t want to lose our jobs. We don\u2019t want to lose our borders. They want to have wage increases. They haven\u2019t in the United States, folks, for the members and all of my members are Turnberry, we\u2019ve had hardworking great people that haven\u2019t had a real wage increase in 18 years. So they\u2019re working harder now and they\u2019re making less money.\u00a0 \nQuestion:\u00a0\n[On Brexit]\n \nQuestion:\u00a0\n[Inaudible]\n \nBut I think places like Scotland and England and different places in Great Britain, I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of activity.\u00a0 \nThe pound got high and people weren\u2019t able to do maybe what they wanted to do. But for traveling and for other things, you know, I think it could very well turn out to be a positive.\u00a0 \nNobody really knows. You\u2019ll know in about five years. You\u2019ll be able to analyze it and maybe it\u2019ll take even longer than that.\u00a0 \nBut what is known is that they\u2019ve taken back their independence, and that\u2019s a very, very important.\u00a0 \nQuestion:\u00a0\n[On Brexit]\n \nPeople want to take their country back and they want to have independence in a sense.\u00a0 \nAnd you see it with Europe. All over Europe. You\u2019re going to have more than just \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 more than just what happened last night.\u00a0 \nYou\u2019re going to have I think many other cases where they want to take their borders. They want to take their monetary back. They want to take a lot of things back. They want to be able to have a country again.\u00a0 \nSo I think you\u2019re going to have this happen more and more. I really believe that.\u00a0 \nAnd I think it\u2019s happening in the United States. It\u2019s happening by the fact that I\u2019ve done so well in the polls. You look at the recent polling and you look at the swing states and you see how I\u2019m doing and I haven\u2019t even started my campaign yet essentially.\u00a0 \nWe\u2019ve done very well. We\u2019re raising a lot of money for the Republican Party. I\u2019m going to funding a lot myself. But we\u2019re raising a lot of money for the Republican Party, and you\u2019ll see those numbers come out over the next 30 days and in particular 60 days.\u00a0 \nThe numbers that were put out last week was just the very start. That was a very small period of time. Just a start. But we have raised a lot of money, especially money coming in small \u2013 from small donors. You\u2019ll be amazed when you see the kind of numbers we\u2019re talking about because we were amazed and I was amazed. But that will be reported fairly soon.\u00a0 \nBut I really do see a parallel between what\u2019s happening in the United States and what\u2019s happening here.\u00a0 \nPeople want to see borders. They don\u2019t necessarily want people pouring into their country that they don\u2019t know who they are, where they come from, they have no idea.\u00a0 \nAnd I think, you know, not only did it win, but it won by a much bigger margin than people thought would happen.\u00a0 "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s press briefing remarks in Marshalltown, Iowa", "text": "Part 6 of 6. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a press conference in Marshalltown, Iowa on Jan. 26, 2016: \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nI said \u2013 it was CNN. I said I think you should give money to the vets. And I\u2019ve always said that. Wounded Warriors and the vets. I think you should give money to the vets... \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nYou have to have \u2013 you know we can all be rebels. I\u2019m a little bit of a rebel. But you have to be able to get along with people. We have to build up our country again. \nOur country is absolutely falling apart. $19 trillion in debt. Tremendous deficits. Our \u2013 believe me. The real number in jobs is not 5.2%. It\u2019s probably in the 25% category because when somebody gives up looking for a job as you know they\u2019re statistically taken off the rolls. \nSo we have to build up our country. To do that, you have to get along. At least you\u2019d have to have a semblance of something. People don\u2019t like Ted Cruz. They don\u2019t like him. \nAnd when you say why am I doing better with the evangelicals than Ted Cruz? Because they like me better than Ted Cruz. And they understand I am a Christian. I\u2019m a good Christian. And the evangelicals have figured that out very easily and very quickly... \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nYou know, I\u2019ve had a great life. I\u2019ve employed tens of thousands of people. I\u2019ve given them jobs. That means education. That means health care. I\u2019ve been very proud of it. \nI\u2019ve built an unbelievable company, just an unbelievable one. When I filed with the FEC, all of you people ran down because you were trying to say \u201cWell, maybe he\u2019s not as big as people think\u201d and it turned out that it was much bigger. I have some of the great assets of the world. I have very little debt. I have tremendous cash flow. And I say that only because that\u2019s what our country needs. That\u2019s what our country needs. Our country needs that kind of thinking. \nWe have $19 trillion. $19 trillion. Think of it. Trillion. We have $19 trillion in debt with a horrible budget deal that was just made. Horrible deal. That\u2019s adding another \u2013 at least another $2 trillion. We\u2019re going to be at $21 trillion in debt. We\u2019re spending money like a bunch of people that don\u2019t have any clues as to what\u2019s happening. \nWe have leadership that\u2019s incompetent. We have leadership that in many respects is stupid. When I hear Kerry the other day say that well some of the $19 billion \u2013 okay? \u2013 some of it...the money that they got back \u2013 the $150 billion \u2013 some of it is going to be spent for terror, like routinely it\u2019s going to be spent for terror. \nAnd you know, it\u2019s interesting. They ordered supposedly I read today \u2013 they\u2019re spending all their money in Europe. Iran is spending all of this money in Europe. They ordered 114 Airbus jets made in Europe. Where\u2019s Boeing? Where\u2019s Boeing? Why aren\u2019t they buying Boeing? Why don\u2019t we have provisions where they have to buy our product? \nSo when I look at the stupidity of our leadership in this country \u2013 and that goes from the border to trade to health care to everything \u2013 I say I have no choice. I love my life. I\u2019ve enjoyed my life. I have a great family. I have a great company. But I had to do this. We\u2019re going to make America great again. \nThank you all very much. Thank you. \nPart 5 of 6. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a press conference in Marshalltown, Iowa on Jan. 26, 2016: \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nNo, but why didn\u2019t you read that before? You didn\u2019t read \u201cI hate the concept of abortion\u201d. \nExcuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Very trustworthy. You sort of knew. Because you know what? You didn\u2019t read the question. \nSee? When you quoted Tim Russert, you didn\u2019t read what you just said. Read it again. No, read it again. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \n...Look, I understand him. And I always got along with him fine. But I always waited and I waited for him to do and finally at the last debate he finally started knocking the people of New York and values. I thought it was a disgrace and a lot of people thought it was a disgrace and I\u2019m not just talking about people from New York. \nWhat\u2019s going to happen over the next period of time, nothing\u2019s going to be nice. Nothing\u2019s going to be easy. \nBut Ted is a wreck. And the reason he\u2019s a wreck is because he doesn\u2019t know if he even \u2013 he has checked and he\u2019s a good lawyer. He doesn\u2019t know himself whether or not he has the legal right to run and to serve as president. Now, how can you vote for somebody when you know the Democrats are going to bring a suit? \nThere\u2019s a cloud on title. It\u2019s called in real estate cloud on title. Here it\u2019s a cloud over his head. Nobody knows whether or not he can even run for office. I tend to doubt it. Some great constitutional lawyers are now saying he doesn\u2019t have the right to serve. He cannot run and serve as president of the United States. That\u2019s a problem. \nI also did not like the fact that on his financial disclosure form, it\u2019s a big problem. He\u2019s going to be Robin Hood. He\u2019s going to protect everybody. Not to mention a couple of little facts. The banks. Right? He didn\u2019t put them in. Now, why didn\u2019t he put Goldman Sachs in? Why didn\u2019t he put Citicorp in? He didn\u2019t put them in. He said he forgot. \nHe also said he didn\u2019t know that he was a Canadian citizen 15 months ago. How come he didn\u2019t know? He\u2019s a smart guy. He said, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know I was.\u201d He didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t know that he was a Canadian citizen. So he was born in Canada, he was a Canadian citizen, and 15 months ago he renounced his citizenship. So he probably has a first. He was the first Canadian citizen ever to be a senator in this country \u2013 a senator from Texas. But he didn\u2019t know he was a Canadian. He was a joint U.S.-Canadian citizen. He was a Canadian citizen. He didn\u2019t know that he was a Canadian citizen? \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd if you check Drudge and if you check Time and if you check Slate and all of the other online polls that judge the debates, almost every single poll \u2013 I think every single poll \u2013 but almost every single poll said I won every single debate. It\u2019s not bad. \nPart 4 of 6. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a press conference in Marshalltown, Iowa on Jan. 26, 2016: \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nWe have gangs right now that are made up in Los Angeles and different places that are made up 100% of illegal immigrants who are rough tough dudes. They would be gone so fast. \nThe local police know all about it. They know who they are. They would be gone so fast. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nYou know, my whole life I\u2019ve been dealing with politicians. That\u2019s what I do. I deal with politicians. Politicians are fine. But now it\u2019s time to do it a lot better because these politicians have turned out to be all talk, no action. They talk. All they care about is getting re-elected. \nWe need to get our deficits. We need to bring our country back. \nWe\u2019re losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade with China. We\u2019re losing tremendous amounts of money in trade with Japan. \n...You look at South Korea. I have friends in South Korea. I have deals in South Korea. I have buildings in South Korea. But we have 28,000 soldiers on the line. 28,000. What do we get out of this? \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nFirst of all, Mexico is going to pay for the wall and the reason Mexico is going to pay \u2013 you know, a lot of people think like some of the politicians \u2013 \u201cWell, you can\u2019t get Mexico...\u201d Of course you can. They\u2019re making a fortune off of the United States in terms of trade. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nI\u2019m going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from Mexico. We\u2019re going to bring jobs back to our country. \nOur country is starving for jobs. We\u2019re losing all of our jobs. We\u2019re losing our base. We\u2019re losing our manufacturing. China is devaluing its currency making it impossible for our \u2013 it\u2019s making it virtually impossible for our companies to compete. \nAnd now, Japan is doing the same thing. Japan is killing us with their yen. They\u2019re devaluing, and you take a look at what\u2019s happening with Caterpillar versus Komatsu and some of the companies over there. It\u2019s brutal. \nTake a look at Caterpillar. They\u2019re getting killed because our politicians don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. \nAnd now we have corporate inversions where a lot of people \u2013 you just saw the one today \u2013 Tyco, et cetera coming out moving Ireland. Pfizer moving to Ireland. They\u2019re leaving the country. \nWe have major corporations leaving the country because our politicians don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nThat\u2019s right. They fly in. They come in. They\u2019re here legally. They stay forever. Can\u2019t happen. We either have a country or we don\u2019t. We\u2019ve got to have a country again. \nIt\u2019s called make America great. It\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. \nPart 3 of 6. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a press conference in Marshalltown, Iowa on Jan. 26, 2016: \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd now you say when does this stop? How many debates do you have to do? \nThe Democrats are finished with their debates. Is that a correct statement? They\u2019re finished. They don\u2019t have any more debates. \nThe Republicans go on forever and ever and ever with debates. We have people on the stand that have zero, that have one, that have nothing. So it\u2019s time that somebody plays grown-up. \nAnd then when I see a press release written by a child like I just saw, I said, \u201cWhat do I have to do? Why do I have to make Fox rich? Let me make the Wounded Warriors rich. Let me make the veterans rich.\u201d \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nI don\u2019t want to be used. \nHey look, this country needs somebody that\u2019s a dealmaker. This country needs somebody that\u2019s going to make great deals with Russia and China and Japan, where they\u2019re sending us millions of cars and we get \u2013 what do we get? Okay? What do we get? We have deficits with these countries. \nWe need people that know what they\u2019re doing. We don\u2019t need babies. \nWhen they send stuff out like that, they\u2019re not dealing with a baby. They\u2019re not dealing with a baby. So we\u2019ll see. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nI said give money to the Wounded Warriors. I said give money to the veterans. \nMegyn Kelly is a lightweight. This is a lightweight. This is not a reporter. This to me is just a lightweight. Megyn Kelly shouldn\u2019t be in the debate. I don\u2019t care about Megyn \u2013 when Megyn Kelly didn\u2019t ask me a question, she made a statement last time, I thought it was inappropriate. Everybody said I won the debate. Everybody said I won the last debate. They said I won all of the debates. \nWe\u2019ve had six debates now. Why should the networks continue getting rich on these debates? Give some to the Wounded Warriors. They\u2019re making a fortune. \nLet\u2019s see how much money Fox is going to make with the debate without me. Okay? All right? Let\u2019s see. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nBut I have the toughest plan in terms of border. Nobody close. I\u2019m building the wall. And now other people are saying we want to build a wall. Where were they? You know, where have they been. \nWe\u2019re talking about a wall. We\u2019re talking about building a strong border. Sheriff Joe understand that probably better than anybody as he\u2019s done a great job and he\u2019s been given very little resource. \nAnd so I think the representation of having Sheriff Joe on my side was really great. Something I appreciated very much. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nWhen I announced I was running for president, I did this on June 16th. Illegal immigration \u2013 this would not even be talked about if I didn\u2019t bring it up. Would not even be talked about. \nRight now, it\u2019s the biggest subject. And now it carries over to ISIS and all of the things that are happening with the migration and Syria and people coming in that we have no idea who they are. We have no idea who these people are. They could be ISIS. They could be \u2013 we don\u2019t know. And it\u2019s got to stop. \nWe owe $19 trillion as a country. We have people running our country that are incompetent. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. We have to create a strong border. We need security for our country. We cannot allow that to happen. \nPart 2 of 6. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a press conference in Marshalltown, Iowa on Jan. 26, 2016: \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nNow, the first thing that\u2019s going to happen if he ever got the nomination, which I don\u2019t think will happen, but if he ever got the nomination, the first thing that\u2019s going to happen is the Democrats are going to sue because there\u2019s a very real question as to whether or not he is able to run, as to whether or not he is entitled to run. \nAs you know, Laurence Tribe said it\u2019s not a settled matter, which is a big problem. But other people have now come back and said this is actually a settled matter; he doesn\u2019t have the right to run. \nI think I\u2019m convincing them. I think we\u2019ve \u2013 look, every poll says I\u2019m ahead and you know, we\u2019ll see what happens. I have bonded with the people of Iowa. I mean, Iowa today I\u2019ve bonded. \nThe evangelicals when I get Jerry Falwell who just endorsed me today, who\u2019s a phenomenal man from Liberty University. When Jerry called up, I was so happy to get that endorsement. Then he put it out just a little while ago. \nBut I\u2019ve really bonded with evangelicals, with the Tea Party and with the people of Iowa. We\u2019ll see what happens. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nI\u2019m not a fan of Megyn Kelly. I think she\u2019s a third-rate reporter. I think she frankly is not good at what she does. And I think they can do a lot better than Megyn Kelly...[Inaudible]...The decision with Fox. But I probably won\u2019t bother doing the debate. \nI see they\u2019ve picked me as number one, not only number one, number one by far. But probably I won\u2019t be doing the debate. \nI\u2019m going to have something else in Iowa. We\u2019ll do something where we raise money for the veterans and the Wounded Warriors. We\u2019re going to do something simultaneously with the debate. But most likely, I\u2019m not going to do the debate. \nI didn\u2019t like the fact that they sent out press releases toying, talking about Putin and playing games. \nI don\u2019t know what games Roger Ailes was playing...what\u2019s wrong over there. Something\u2019s wrong. \nBut when they sent out that press release talking about, I said, \u201cWhy are these people playing games?\u201d So most likely I won\u2019t be doing the debate. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nNow, let\u2019s see how many people watch. We\u2019ll have our own event. We\u2019ll raise some money for the Wounded Warriors. We\u2019ll raise money for the vets. \nBut when they sent out the wise guy press releases a little while ago \u2013 I was all set to do the debate. I came here to do the debate. When they sent out the wise guy press releases a little while ago, done by some PR person along with Roger Ailes, I said \u201cBye bye.\u201d Okay? \nPart 1 of 6. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a press conference in Marshalltown, Iowa on Jan. 26, 2016: \n...Well, I want to thank Sheriff Joe. This is a man, when we talk about borders, this is a man who believes in borders. And getting his endorsement means a lot to me. \nAnd he called and he said he\u2019d like to do it, he\u2019s actually wanted to do that for quite some time. We said let\u2019s hold it for a little because we\u2019re looking at the world and we\u2019re seeing what\u2019s happening. We\u2019re seeing a lot of bad things happening, and he\u2019s the kind of guy that we want on our team. \nHe\u2019s tough. He\u2019s strong. And he\u2019s smart. And he\u2019s done an amazing job. And he\u2019s got a great, great following of people that absolutely love him and revere him. \nAnd Joe, I would like to really thank you. Come here. Thank you very much... \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWe got a tremendous endorsement today, as you know, from Jerry Falwell from Liberty University. Jerry\u2019s a terrific man respected by everybody. \nAnd I will tell you that...no deals. Jerry didn\u2019t say, \u201cOh, could I do this? Could I do that?\u201d Joe didn\u2019t say it. Sarah didn\u2019t say it. We don\u2019t make deals. \nWe don\u2019t make deals. Not with Fox. Not with anybody. We don\u2019t make deals. \nYou have a dealmaker for the country. The country needs somebody that knows what they\u2019re doing because we\u2019re a country that is adrift. We\u2019re a country that doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing at the top. \nWhen you look at the Iran deal, when you look at the Bergdahl deal, when you look at any single thing they are doing, we are adrift. We have no idea what we\u2019re doing as a country and it\u2019s a problem. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \n...And I said \u2013 what did I say? You didn\u2019t read it. Read the full statement of what I said. Read the full statement. No, no, you\u2019re not reading the full statement. Go ahead, get out the full statement. Read it. \nQuestion: \n[Inaudible]\n \nNo, no, but read the full statement. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech at the NRA Leadership Forum", "text": "In Florida, for example, they\u2019ve issued more than 3 million concealed carry permits in the past 30 years. Only 168 have been revoked. That\u2019s 0.006%. So very, very few and just no difficulty. \nHillary wants to go into the opposite direction. \nShe said that President Obama didn\u2019t go far enough when he executed this order when he signed this order. He\u2019s not going far enough. He\u2019s gone so far. He\u2019s gone too far. We\u2019re going to stop it. \nAnd we will un-sign lots of different things, including some of those terrible executive orders. Believe me, they\u2019re going to be un-signed so fast they\u2019ll be un-signed the first hour that I\u2019m in office, in the first hour that I\u2019m in office. \nHillary\u2019s pledge to issue new anti-gun executive orders. You know that. This is the behavior, you could say, of a dictator. This is the behavior of somebody frankly I think that doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s not equipped to be president in so many different ways. \nBut this is the thinking of a person that is not equipped to be the president of the United States. Believe me. She doesn\u2019t understand it. Bad judgment. \nWe talk about it. She\u2019s got bad judgment. You know where it came from. Came from me. It also came from her current opponent, who\u2019s doing pretty well. I\u2019ll tell you, you talk about a rigged system. He wins every week and he keeps losing. \nI think Bernie should run as an independent, okay? Let him run. \nI do. I would love him to run as an independent. Then it would be the three of us on stage. I love that. \nThe Second Amendment is on the ballot in November. The only way to save our Second Amendment is to vote for a person that you all know named Donald Trump. Okay? I will tell you. \nI will never let you down. I will protect our Second Amendment. \nI will protect our country. Our military will be strong. Our border will be enforced. \nWe\u2019ll get rid of Common Core, which is a disaster. We\u2019ll bring education local. So important. Our education is a mess. \nWe\u2019re going to get rid of Obamacare. We\u2019re going to have a great, great plan as a substitute. Obamacare is out of control. \nThe new cost, as you know, they\u2019re going to be revealed on Nov. 1st. They\u2019re going to be through the roof. And by the way, don\u2019t let this happen. We\u2019ll have to speak to Mitch. Obama is trying to get it delayed until after the election. The new costs will be revealed on Nov. 1st unless he gets it changed and we don\u2019t want that to happen. There will be so astronomical and it will show what a total failure and disaster Obamacare is. \nWe will repeal it and we will replace it with something great. Okay? Believe me. \nWe\u2019re going to have strong borders and we\u2019re going to make the greatest trade deals every country worldwide, every country in the world is ripping off our great country like we\u2019re children. Like taking candy from a baby. \nOur trade deals will be renegotiated. We won\u2019t be having trade deficits of $500 billion a year with China anymore folks. They won\u2019t be taking our jobs out of here and Kentucky and lots of other places, every place. They won\u2019t be taking our jobs and bringing them into Mexico like with Nabisco where they leave Chicago, moving to Mexico and so many other countries. \nCompanies \u2013 Carrier. You take a look at Carrier Air Conditioning. Just left Indiana. They\u2019re leaving Indiana. They\u2019re moving to Mexico. That\u2019s not happening with me. Because when they make their air conditioners and they sell them across our now very strong border, believe me, they\u2019re going to pay a tax and they\u2019re going to say, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to move to Mexico anymore.\u201d It\u2019s so simple. It\u2019s so simple. \nSo we\u2019re going to have great trade agreements. We\u2019re going to become a strong nation again. We\u2019re going to save our Social Security. We\u2019re going to save our Medicare. We\u2019re going to be so proud of this country. \nYou\u2019re going to be proud of your president. But I don\u2019t care about that. You\u2019re going to be proud of your country again. \nAnd we\u2019re going to start winning again because we don\u2019t win anymore. We don\u2019t win on trade. We don\u2019t win with the military. We can\u2019t beat ISIS. Believe me, we\u2019re going to knock the hell out of ISIS. We have no choice. We\u2019re going to knock the hell out of ISIS. \nSo we are going to start winning again and I have fun saying it and I say it a lot but there\u2019s nothing better. And some of you have heard it but we are going to win, win, win. We\u2019re going to win with military. We\u2019re going to win at the borders. We\u2019re going to win with trade. We\u2019re going to win at everything. \nAnd some of you are friends and you\u2019re going to call and you\u2019re going to say, \u201cMr. President, please we can\u2019t take it anymore. We can\u2019t win anymore like this. Mr. President, you\u2019re driving us crazy. You\u2019re winning too much. Please, Mr. President. Not so much.\u201d \nAnd I\u2019m going to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. We\u2019re going to keep winning because we are going to make America great again!\u201d \nThank you! We love you. Thank you! Thank you, everybody. Thank you, Kentucky. Thank you, everybody! \nPresident Obama tried to take the guns from law-abiding Americans but has reduced prosecutions of violent criminals who use guns. \nPresident Obama is even releasing violent criminals from the jails, including drug dealers and those with gun crimes, and they\u2019re being let go by the thousands \u2013 by the thousands. \nMany of these are also I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not going to be surprised to hear this illegal immigrants. \nPresident Obama pushed for changes to sentencing laws that released thousands of dangerous drug trafficking felons and gang members who prey on civilians. \nNow, I want to tell you, I\u2019ve really learned a lot about the border. In fact, two weeks ago, you probably saw 16,500 border patrol agents endorsed Donald Trump. \nAnd we\u2019ve gotten great endorsements. To have the endorsement from NRA today and to have the endorsement from the border patrol agents. \nAnd I was talking to them \u2013 these are wonderful people that want to do their job. That\u2019s why they\u2019re endorsing me. They could just sort of \u2013 you know, they\u2019re told to stand back, don\u2019t do it. They want to do their job. These are incredible people. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve ever endorsed a presidential candidate and 16,500 so I\u2019m really honored by that. \nThis is Hillary Clinton\u2019s agenda too \u2013 to release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released. She wants people released that you wouldn\u2019t want to walk on the street with, you wouldn\u2019t want to look at. \nAnd you know, whether it\u2019s Kate from San Francisco, you see what happened there or Jamiel \u2013 I\u2019ve become great friends with his father. Jamiel was shot in the face three times by somebody that wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. Or and I always say this because this was tragic \u2013 a 65 year old veteran, a woman who was a great woman, raped, sodomized, and killed by an illegal immigrant who wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. We\u2019re going to straighten it out. \nAnd by the way, this doesn\u2019t have to do with guns per se but may it has to do with a lot of other things. We\u2019re going to build a wall. It\u2019s going to be a great wall. We\u2019re going to have borders again. People are going to come into the country but they\u2019re coming into the country legally, folks. They\u2019re coming in legally. We\u2019re going to keep our borders open. And I\u2019ll tell you, but they\u2019re going to be open when people come in legally. \nNow, Hillary wants to just keep them open \u2013 anybody can come across and that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening and the crime is violent and a lot. And lots of other things are happening with the drugs pouring across. \nSo she\u2019s putting the most vulnerable Americans in jeopardy. And this is a risk we can no longer afford. We\u2019ve had enough. I think we\u2019ve had enough. Wouldn\u2019t you say we\u2019ve had like \u2013 \nIn trying to overturn the Second Amendment, Hillary Clinton is telling everyone and every women living in a dangerous community that she doesn\u2019t have the right to defend herself. \nSo you have a woman living in a community \u2013 a rough community, a bad community \u2013 \u201cSorry, you can\u2019t defend yourself.\u201d That is so unfair and that is so egregious. \nAnd I\u2019ll tell what, my poll numbers with women are starting to go up. I never thought of it. This should really lift them up, right? Starting to go up. \nI will say my poll numbers with the men are through the roof. But I like women more than men. Come on, women. Let\u2019s go. Come on. And those people know that about me. Most people know. \nThis is the most basic human right of all but Hillary wants to strip it away and strip it away from women and all others. \nHillary Clinton will release violent criminals from jail more so than even Obama. She has a more open policy than Obama if that\u2019s possible and put innocent Americans at risk. \nI\u2019m going to put criminal behind bars and guarantee that law-abiding Americans have the right to self defense 100%. \nThere are 13 million right to carry permit holders in the United States. I happen to be one of them. In the past \u2013 nobody knows that. Boy, would I surprise somebody if they hit Trump. If I wasn\u2019t surrounded by like the largest group of Secret Service people, who by the way are fantastic people and our police are fantastic, fantastic people, we have to give a standing ovation to our police. We have to. They are fantastic people. Amazing. \nThey do such a great job. They are so unfairly treated. But they know and they know how the people feel about them. \nThank you. That\u2019s great. \nIn the past 30 years, the number of right to carry states has gone up seven fold. These are among the most law-abiding folks statistically in the entire country. So they have the right to carry. They\u2019re among the most \u2013 you know, they do statistics on everything. Right? Everything. And these are among the most \u2013 and in fact, they\u2019re like at the top of the list. \nIf Hillary gets to appoint her judges, you know, one of the biggest and most important reasons to win this time \u2013 it\u2019s very unusual. Sometimes you get no judges to appoint. Sometimes you go for years and there\u2019s no judges. \nProbably there\u2019ll be a minimum \u2013 you have Scalia who was one of the greats. Well, his position\u2019s up. Great. He was great. But you have Scalia so you have one before you even start. Assuming and I\u2019m sure that Mitch [McConnell] and the guys are going to be able to hold out. I have no doubt about it because we don\u2019t want anybody taking that slot. \nBut you have Scalia and you\u2019ll probably have three \u2013 it could be four and it could even be five judges. So I think in terms of presidential \u2013 and we\u2019re talking about a four-year period. And of course, we tend to be there for eight years. But we\u2019ll make it so good in four that you\u2019ll probably say, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do it any longer, Mr. President.\u201d \nBut I can\u2019t stress in any stronger fashion whoever the next president is going to appoint from three to five judges. \nAnd if it\u2019s Hillary or whoever, assuming she\u2019s allowed to run because you know what? What she did with her emails is so criminal and so dishonest, is so shocking that she shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run but it looks like they\u2019re going to let her run. And that\u2019s okay with me because really I do want to run against her. I have to be honest with you. \nSo if she gets to appoint her judges, she will as part of it abolish the Second Amendment and I have to say that would be in my opinion that\u2019s what she\u2019s going to go for and it\u2019s a little like what she did with the coal miners. She said about, you know, she\u2019s going to put the coal miners, she\u2019s going to put the mines out of business. Then she went to West Virginia and she said, \u201cWell, I\u2019d try to retract.\u201d You know, she tried to retract it. It didn\u2019t work out too well for her. She got really beaten badly. \nHillary wants to disarm vulnerable Americans in high crime neighborhoods. Whether it\u2019s a young single mom in Florida or a grandmother in Ohio, Hillary wants them to be defenseless, wants to take away any chance they have of survival. \nAnd by the way, you have men and you have women sitting in an apartment and outside is tremendous crime \u2013 tremendous crime of all kinds \u2013 and they need to be protected and you know the only way they\u2019re going to be able to protect themselves. And if you take away that gun from them, it\u2019s going to be very unfair situation. \nAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to call her Heartless Hillary. We can do without that. \nSomehow I like crooked Hillary better. \nI put forth and you probably saw it a few days ago, I put forth a list of judges who will protect and defend all of our freedoms, including the Second Amendment. The judges will follow the Constitution and these were all highly vetted \u2013 the Federalist Society, Heritage, some great references from Jeff Sessions \u2013 a fantastic man, from Mitch and from a whole group of people. And we put down 11. I\u2019ll be adding some additional names over a period of the next month or so sometime prior to the convention. \nI hope you can all go to the convention. I hope you can come. And we\u2019re going to be putting some additional names and I think you\u2019re going to be very happy with them. But it\u2019s been reviewed incredibly well. People love these people. \nAnd I\u2019d though I do that because I really think it brings the party together. It really is going \u2013 I mean the effect it\u2019s had is incredible because they weren\u2019t sure. Will Trump appoint this one or that one? Who will the judges be? Such an important thing. So I put together the list with some incredibly important organizations that are highly respected and everybody\u2019s really happy. You\u2019ve seen we\u2019ve got A-plus reviews on that. \nNow, I\u2019d like to call for Hillary Clinton to put together a list also. Okay? Let her put together a list because I\u2019d like to see what that list consists of. And you will see it\u2019s day and night and it will not be good for the people in this room. And it won\u2019t be good by the way for the people of our country, most importantly. \nSo, Americans use guns to defend themselves against violent crime more than a million times a year. More than a million times a year. And they want to take them away. \nHeartless hypocrites like the Clintons want to take this and they want to get rid of guns. And yet, they have body guards that have guns. \nSo I think that in addition to calling for them to name judges, we\u2019ll also call them and let their body guards immediately disarm. Okay? Now, they should immediately disarm and let\u2019s see how good they do. Let\u2019s see how they feel walking around without their guns on their body guards. In the meantime, nobody else can have the guns. Right? \n\u201cPut your guns away\u201d. \nSo their guns are locked up, put in a different area of the place, and this whack job walks in and starts shooting them. Killed all five of them. \nGun-free zones. We\u2019re getting rid of gun-free zones. Okay? I could tell you. We\u2019re getting rid of them. \nThat wasn\u2019t part of my speech. I must be honest with you. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t read you what I have here but \u2013 \nIn fact, if I would have known teleprompters I would have used them. I started to use them a little bit. They\u2019re not bad. You never get yourself in trouble when you use a teleprompter. \nYou know, the problem is it\u2019s too easy. We have a president who uses teleprompters. It\u2019s too easy. \nWe should have non-teleprompter speeches only when you\u2019re running for president. You find out about people... \nSo, the Second Amendment is under a threat like never before. \nCrooked Hillary Clinton is the most anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment candidate ever to run for office and as I said before she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. She wants to take your guns away. She wants to abolish it. Just remember that. \nThe NRA and the late hero \u2013 he was a great guy \u2013 Charlton Heston, who many of you knew. I met him a few times. He was an incredible guy. Did battle with the Clintons to protect our Second Amendment. \nThe NRA has led the fight time and time again to protect our fundamental freedom. \nThis is an amazing group...These are incredible people and they really \u2013 this isn\u2019t like a job. They really, really believe. And we\u2019re all lucky to have people like that. I will tell you. Really lucky. \nOf course, if they didn\u2019t endorse me, maybe I wouldn\u2019t say that. \nI would. \nHillary Clinton wants to reverse the Supreme Court decision D.C. v. Heller upholding the right to keep and bear arms. Hillary said the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. \nThat\u2019s bad. That\u2019s like what she said about the miners \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re going to put the miners and the mines out of business.\u201d \nThen she goes \u2013 right? Then she goes to \u2013 oh, I\u2019ll tell you, West Virginia. How were they? I\u2019d hate to say I won Kentucky but I won West Virginia by even more. I really \u2013 but of course she made that statement after I had already won Kentucky. We\u2019re going to win them all. We\u2019re going to win them all. We\u2019re going to win them all. \nIf Hillary gets to appoint her judges, this is really important. \nLook, defense is number one. We have to protect our country. Defense. Economy is all important. Everything is important. But without defense, we don\u2019t have a country. And our military, as you know, is being decapitated. What they are doing to our military is incredible. \nI saw over the weekend a documentary on our great airmen. And these are people that are flying our jets and they\u2019re running out of parts for our fighter jets. And these are fighter pilots. These are incredible men. And they\u2019re going to junk yards \u2013 plane grave yards they call them where the planes are. They\u2019re grave yards where the old planes \u2013 and they\u2019re taking parts off. They\u2019re cannibalizing the planes. They\u2019re taking parts off the planes and they\u2019re putting them onto the jets. \nAnd I\u2019m saying, \u201cIs this the United States? Why don\u2019t we have new equipment?\u201d \nAnd a man got up \u2013 a great guy \u2013 looks as good or better than Tom Cruise, and you know what I\u2019m talking about because that was a great movie. And he said, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019ve been in this for 20 years and it used to be so incredible. And now it\u2019s like a different world. The equipment, the way it\u2019s being maintained, everything. It\u2019s like a different world.\u201d \nAnd I just have to say, just to interrupt what I\u2019m going to be talking about, I have to say we\u2019re going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and nobody \u2013 nobody \u2013 is going to push us around. Nobody. Nobody. \nAnd by the way, as part of that, we are going to take care of our great veterans. And I have to tell you the proper way. The proper way. \nHe said she suffers from bad judgment and she does. You look at so many of her decisions have been bad. \nSo I think we\u2019re going to do really, really well and I look forward to it. And I actually look very forward to the debates. \nI\u2019ve loved the debates...I\u2019ve never debated before and all of a sudden we have all these debates and that was a big question mark in my mind. How will I do in debates? I\u2019m debating people that were on their national debating teams and all of these top debaters. But they\u2019ve never had people interrupting them every other word they\u2019re saying \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re a liar\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019re a liar\u201d \u2013 they\u2019re trying to speak and they can\u2019t speak. \nYou would have done the same. I know a lot of you in the audience you would have done the same. \nAnd I just want to give this and I want to really \u2013 it\u2019s so important to me. I wrote it down. \nAnd again, my sons have been members of the NRA for many, many years, and they\u2019re incredible. They have so many rifles and so many guns sometimes even I get a little bit concerned. I say that\u2019s a lot. Okay? But I will tell you they are \u2013 they know so much about it. \nReally, they\u2019re surrogates. They go around and speak. And every time they speak to a gun organization or a club, people call me and they say \u201cYour boys are great boys and boy do they know their business.\u201d So, it\u2019s one of those things and it\u2019s the way we want it. \nAnd you know, I\u2019ve mentioned so often we talk about Paris or we talk about San Bernardino and nobody had guns. \nYou know, Paris is probably in the world the toughest place to have a gun. The toughest. France, generally, but Paris in particular. \nAnd when these thugs walked in \u2013 thugs. You know, the press used to call them \u201cmasterminds\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re masterminds we\u2019re looking\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s why people are joining. That\u2019s why people are coming in because you\u2019re using the word \u201cmastermind\u201d. Not mastermind \u2013 thugs. \nIn fact, I call them the guy with the dirty cap. Remember the white cap? And it was filthy dirty. This was the \u201cmastermind\u201d. \nAnd actually, the press has stopped using the term. They\u2019re very dishonest people. Among the most dishonest I\u2019ve ever met but they actually stopped using the term \u201cmastermind\u201d because they use that term and then they wonder why our youth is going and fighting for ISIS. They don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re fighting for. But I think it\u2019s gotten a lot better from that standpoint. \nBut if you look at Paris, 130 people killed, hundreds of people still in the hospital. Just horribly wounded. Can never be the same. Horribly wounded. \nAnd these guys came in \u2013 boom! Boom! Boom! You over here \u2013 boom! \nAnd they just stood there and just shot everybody. \nNo guns in the other side, folks. If you would have had guns on the other side, if I took a couple of these folks in here \u2013 some especially wearing the red caps \u2013 Make America Great Again \u2013 I promise there wouldn\u2019t have been 130 people killed and hundreds of people lying in the hospital to this day. \nIt might not have happened because if they knew there were guns in the room, it might have happened. But if it did, you would have had bullets going in the opposite direction and believe me, the carnage would not have been the same by any stretch of the imagination. \nAnd I tell the same story on San Bernardino. Here is two people. I guess she radicalized him. Who knows? Who knows? It\u2019s a mess. We\u2019re in a mess folks. A mess. \nRadical Islamic terrorism. We have a president doesn\u2019t mention the words, doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, and if you don\u2019t want to talk about it, you\u2019re never going to solve a very big problem and we\u2019re talking a worldwide problem. \nWe\u2019re not talking here. We\u2019re not talking Kentucky. We\u2019re talking all over the world this is a problem, and we have a president doesn\u2019t want to mention the name. \nYou have San Bernardino \u2013 14 people. They worked with these two. They worked with them. They gave them a baby shower. They had a baby. The people they worked with gave them a baby shower. They walked in. No guns on the other side. They had the guns and they killed 14 people. Many wounded. Many in the hospital to this day. But they wounded many. But they killed 14 of their co-workers, and the co-workers thought they were friends. So there\u2019s something going on. \nNow, I\u2019ll tell you again, same story. If we had guns in the other side, it wouldn\u2019t have been that way. I would have boom! If we had guns on the other side, it wouldn\u2019t have been that way. \nAnd then you have gun-free zones. The gun-free zones. That\u2019s real. \nWe had a case, you know, about a year and a half ago. It was the first I really heard of this where you had the five military people \u2013 great people \u2013 one was a master marksman \u2013 a master with anything he touched having to do with guns, weapons, anything he touched. \nAnd they were told \u2013 this was on a military base, folks, on a military base. They were told put your guns away. These are soldiers. These are people that are representing us. These were the top of the line. These were five great brave incredible soldiers. \nThank you very much. This is amazing. I did not know that. I knew I was doing well but I did not know that. \nAnd I\u2019ve been a member for a long time and my boys are members and they\u2019re much better shooters than I am. They know more about guns than any \u2013 I don\u2019t know there might be two or three people in this room but believe it or not, not many. \nSo to get the endorsement, believe me, is a fantastic honor. \nAnd I just said to Wayne and I just said to Chris I will not let you down. Remember that, I will not let you down. \nAnd you know, I wrote a few remarks and I\u2019m actually going to read them because we\u2019re going into a little detail but I will tell you that Hillary Clinton \u2013 and you know, I call her Crooked Hillary because all you have to do is read any newspaper you want. \nBut Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment. Just remember that. We\u2019re not talking about changing. She wants to abolish the Second Amendment. \nSo we\u2019re not going to let that happen, I can tell you that right now. We\u2019re going to preserve it. We\u2019re going to cherish it. We\u2019re going to take care of it. Okay? \nYou know, they keep chipping away. They talk about the magazines. They talk about the bullets. We\u2019re going to take care of it. \nYou know, a couple of things before I give you some more detailed remarks. \nI feel really happy with what\u2019s going on. \nYou know, the Fox poll came out three days ago and in the Fox poll I\u2019m leading Hillary 41 to 44. 44. \nAnd last night, Rasmussen, which is a highly respected poll, came out \u2013 Trump 42, Crooked Hillary Clinton 37. \nSo we\u2019re doing well. \nNow, with all that, we have a long way to go. But if you get every one of your friends to go vote because there\u2019s a big difference \u2013 you know, on a lot of things there\u2019s a difference and some are subtle, some are big. \nAnd by the way, we\u2019re in Kentucky. We\u2019re going to put the miners back to work before I forget about that. We\u2019re going to put the miners \u2013 we just left and I also won Kentucky so I love Kentucky. \nI used to work in Cincinnati. For two summers, I worked in Cincinnati doing a job with my father. And I loved Cincinnati and I\u2019d come over the line and I\u2019d be in Kentucky. You\u2019d be surprise how much I know about Kentucky. But it\u2019s an amazing place. \nBut I said when I won New York, because we won New York in a landslide, and then Pennsylvania and Maryland and we won everything. We were winning everything. We won Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island. And then we went to West Virginia and boy did I win. Did we do well in West Virginia? Wow. \nBut all landslides. We won in all of the states I mentioned and more \u2013 every single county in every single state. That\u2019s called a victory. And we won by massive percentages in the 60s and some in the 70s. \nAnd then of course we went to Indiana. As you know, that was going to be \u2013 that was going to be the firewall for the other side. And it turned out to be a massive victory for us again. It didn\u2019t hurt that Bobby Knight came out and said \u201cI want Trump to win.\u201d That didn\u2019t hurt. If you\u2019re in Indiana and Bobby Knight endorses you, I guess that\u2019s about as good as it gets. \nSo I just want to say that I\u2019ve been watching what\u2019s going on and I\u2019ve been looking at airplanes getting blown up in the air and lots of bad things happening. It\u2019s just not the same. \nAnd we\u2019re going to bring it back and we\u2019re going to bring it back to a real place where we don\u2019t have to be so frightened, where we don\u2019t have to be so afraid. \nAnd you know what\u2019s happening in the schools and you know what\u2019s happening everywhere. We\u2019re going to bring it back and you folks are going to be so happy and you\u2019re going to be so proud of your country again. Just remember. \nBernie Sanders, who I\u2019m sure you all love, he did say one thing that was very interesting. He said that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be the president of the United States. And he said that and it\u2019s just you know one of those things. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Manchester, New Hampshire", "text": "We\u2019re going to reduce the taxes for middle income people. We call them the forgotten man and women. \nGreatly simplify your returns. \nThe only company that I can think of that won\u2019t like us is H&R Block. They will not like it. They\u2019re not going to like Trump too much. \nBut will simplify your taxes. And your businesses, we\u2019re taking it from 35%. which is one of the highest in the world, just about the highest, down to one of the lowest in the world, 15%. \nWe\u2019re getting rid of a lot of the regulations that are stopping growth. Tremendous amounts of regulations are killing your small businesses and your big businesses. \nSo we\u2019re going to have a very tax friendly country again, and it\u2019s going to mean jobs, it\u2019s going to mean expansion, it\u2019s going to be new companies growing. \nWe are going to create the border. We are going to stop the drugs. We\u2019re going have people come into our country. \nWe want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. They have to come in through a legal process. We want a lot of people to come in and they\u2019re going to come in but they\u2019ll come in legally. And we\u2019re going to streamline the process; people are waiting on line now 10 years. We\u2019re going to streamline it because we want them to come in but we want them to come in legally. \nAnd we want merit too. We want to take wonderful, great people that love our country, and they want to get out and they want to do a great job. We want to have them also come in based on merit. A word you don\u2019t hear anymore. A word you don\u2019t hear anymore. It\u2019s too bad. \nWe\u2019re also going to, very importantly, appoint justices to the Supreme Court who you can be proud of and who will respect the Constitution of the United States. \nWe\u2019re going to save our Second Amendment, which is under unbelievable siege. \nWe\u2019re going to help big league on education. We\u2019re going to go with choice, so important, and we\u2019re going to terminate Common Core and bring education local. \nOur military is depleted. We are going to rebuild our military. We are going to lead through strength, and hopefully, we\u2019re not going to have to use our military. \nBut I will say this, ISIL, we\u2019re getting rid of ISIS. We are getting rid of ISIS. ISIS is we have no choice. \nBy the way, not since medieval times has anyone seen anything \u2013 chopping off of heads, drowning in steel cages, burying in sand. Not since, not since medieval times. \nIt all grew during the tenure of Obama and Hillary Clinton \u2013 ISIS. \nAnd you know, she stands up and she says what she\u2019s going to do. Well, she was there. It came out of the vacuum, because we should\u2019ve never gone to Iraq, but once we did, we should\u2019ve gone out the right way, not the wrong way. And the way they went out was so sad, so bad, including giving back Mosul, which now they\u2019re fighting to take back. \nAnd it would have been nice, the element of surprise \u2013 do we agree, does anybody not agree? The element of surprise. We don\u2019t use the element of surprise. We use the element of tell them everything we can possibly tell them, give them plenty of time to get ready, and then attack. And it turns out to be a lot tougher than they ever thought. \nBut we\u2019re going to have a country you\u2019re going to be proud of again. \nWe are going to have a president that hopefully, you will be proud of. \nI will work so hard for every community. I\u2019ll be working very hard for the African-American community, for the Hispanic community. I\u2019ll be working hard for every community. And we\u2019re going to have this divided nation come together. \nAnd I just want to say, we\u2019re going to make America strong again. We\u2019re going to make America, it doesn\u2019t sound nice, but we have no choice, wealthy again. But we are going to make America great again. \nAnd I want to thank everybody in New Hampshire. Get out and vote. You\u2019re very special people. You are very, very special people. \nGod bless you. Get out and vote. Thank you, thank you, New Hampshire. \nHe released again and again after crime after crime and now is at large. \nSarah graduated from college just the day before with a 4.0 grade point average. Top in her class. She was violently, violently killed. Outstanding young woman. I know her parents; they\u2019re incredible. \nAlso among the victims of Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody. And so many people said, \u201cPlease, please, please don\u2019t release him. He\u2019s violent.\u201d And he shot Grant through the head. \nAnother victim who we\u2019ve all read about and known about, Kate Steinle, gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant. And this person was deported five previous times. And now, he\u2019s got a good lawyer and the case will go on and on and on. He\u2019s got a lawyer. I see them in court all the time. The case will go on and on. Shot in the back while standing with her father. Great parents, great brother. \nThen there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long but who did not meet the Obama administration\u2019s priorities for removal. People begged that they be incarcerated or be moved out of the country, but our geniuses wouldn\u2019t listen. \nIn California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never deported. People asked please, please deport him. \nThis is what happened. This is a crime wave that never ends. I can tell you it\u2019s thousands of cases like this. \nWhen I\u2019m president, believe me, it will end. \nNot only will a wall keep out the dangerous cartels and criminals, but will also keep out the drugs, remember New Hampshire, and the heroin poisoning our youth. Our youth is being poisoned before they get a chance. \nAnd by the way, I\u2019ve met plenty of people in New Hampshire that are not our youth that have a tremendous problem, and I want to tell you, we\u2019re going to work with people. We\u2019re going to set up programs. We\u2019re going to try everything we can to get them unaddicted, unaddicted. \nSo as I said, when I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that we would stop drugs from pouring into your community and I guarantee you we will. \nYou will be so proud of your president, you will be so proud of your community. You will be so proud. \nI just want to say in closing \u2014 I just want to say in closing that we have an amazing movement going on. A movement like they\u2019ve never seen before. A movement that hopefully won\u2019t be stopped. \nWe have a movement that the biggest people in the world of the media, the biggest, have said they\u2019ve never seen anything like it before. Every \u2014 every crowd, every auditorium. \nThe other night, we had a situation. We had thousands and thousands of people. And I said to the fire marshal, \u201cIsn\u2019t it possible to let more in?\u201d We had thousands of people in this massive field, and we had many thousands outside of the gates they wouldn\u2019t let in. And I said, \u201cCouldn\u2019t we let them in?\u201d And they said, \u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d I said, \u201cBut there\u2019s no fire. We\u2019re outside.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s stampede, Mr. Trump. We\u2019re worried about a stampede.\u201d \nAnd it\u2019s a stampede of love. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s not a stampede \u2014 it\u2019s a stampede of love. Because there was so many people. They said, \u201cWe have very strong security guards, but Mr. Trump, they\u2019re not nearly strong as 45,000 people come charging forward.\u201d So I fully understood it. \nBut we have something going on that\u2019s so special. It\u2019s so special. \nWe\u2019re going to reduce your taxes. We\u2019re going to simplify your taxes. We\u2019re going to make your businesses welcome in our country. \nThe recent poll said we\u2019re two down in New Hampshire. You know what I said? I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t think so. \nThese polls, these polls, these are called dirty polls. You know what that is? These are false. I don\u2019t think so. \nShe comes up here. She has four people, and it\u2019s like \u201cOh, we have a wonderful crowd.\u201d \nI don\u2019t think so. I think we\u2019re winning New Hampshire big. \nOkay. So we\u2019ll change it. When I\u2019m elected president, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. \nA Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. \nBoy, do you people have energy. You\u2019re great. \nWell, let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s been a long time, right? It\u2019s been a long time. You\u2019ve been waiting a long time for the right person, but you do have energy. \nYou know what\u2019s happening? A lot of these places... A lot of the different places, reports are coming out. They hate to write it, you know the dishonest media. \nBut people \u2014 by the way, great people. \nOh they\u2019re the worst. They\u2019re so dishonest. They are so dishonest, folks. \nBut a lot of these reports coming out in the early voting states, people are coming up that have never voted. These are great Americans. These are great people, but they\u2019ve just never seen anybody that they wanted to like. They\u2019ve never heard people say we\u2019re going to actually bring back your jobs. We\u2019re not going to let companies leave us and fire everybody and move and then let the product pour into our country with no tax. \nNo, no, just go ahead, leave, fire all our people, move to Mexico, make the product, sell your air conditioners \u2014 Carrier\u2019s an example, they\u2019re leaving \u2014 they might not leave, they\u2019re probably all about ready to change their mind. But just let your product come right in, no tax, no nothing. \nI mean, how stupid is this? How stupid? \nAnd I\u2019m a free-trader. I\u2019m a fair trader. But we have the wrong people represent us. \nSo what\u2019s happening is these lines in Florida are four blocks long. They were never like that. They\u2019ve never seen anything like it. \nAnd in Tennessee, a great congressman, been there for 25 years, said to me, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen \u2014 we have never seen anything like it.\u201d \nPeople are coming out that haven\u2019t voted in years. People are coming out, they literally \u2014 they hadn\u2019t voted in years. \nSo they\u2019re not polled because, you know, unless you voted like in the last election, they don\u2019t want to poll you. \nSo, people are coming out that hadn\u2019t voted in years. Happening in Texas. They haven\u2019t voted in years. And people that have never even voted, and yet they\u2019re great Americans. They just never saw somebody that they wanted to vote for. \nAnd they\u2019re coming out and they\u2019ve got the Trump shirt and they\u2019ve got the hat, they\u2019ve got buttons all over the place, you know. \nNow, who knows? Who knows? They may have all of the Trump stuff and you never know. Maybe they\u2019re voting for crooked Hillary Clinton. But I don\u2019t think so, right? I don\u2019t think so. \nHistory has taught us that we don\u2019t think so. So, I think we\u2019re doing great. \nAnd yes, on the border, we have no choice. We will build a wall and Mexico will pay for the wall. Got to stop the drugs. Got to stop the drugs. \nRemember my pledge to everybody but in particular to New Hampshire, because I know what you\u2019re going through with the drugs. I know what your incredible law enforcement, your police and your fire departments, because I see where they\u2019re helping so much. Believe me, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re not spoken about. \nAnd how about where they\u2019re shooting? During fires, they\u2019re shooting at the firemen. Now, this is a new phenomenon. They\u2019re shooting at firemen. They\u2019re shooting bullets at firemen going to fires and fighting fires. \nSo we have a divided country, and we\u2019re going to make our country love again. We\u2019re going to bring it like this room. \nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration. \nThis includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. \nYou\u2019ve heard that story. You\u2019ve seen it. You\u2019ve read about it. \nThe man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the United States community under the policies of this White House. \nWe\u2019re living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. They\u2019re stealing our jobs. Greatest in the history of the world. \nNew Hampshire has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary. \nWe\u2019ve lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary disaster. \nThe Trump administration will immediately begin negotiating, and we will start this negotiation so fast. We will start a negotiation on NAFTA, and if we don\u2019t get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much, much better trade deal. \nAnd I won\u2019t go into the details. But because they\u2019re different tax systems, they\u2019re under a VAT system, and we\u2019re under our system. But because of the fact that they\u2019re under a much different tax system, the day the deal was signed, it was a defective deal, with us having a massive, at least 17% disadvantage. \nSo it\u2019s complicated. I\u2019m not going to bother you or bore you with it. But we\u2019ve been working with a defective deal for years, and nobody, no politician ever went back to renegotiate it. We\u2019re going to get it done, folks, so easily. \nIf a company wants to fire their workers and go to Mexico or another country and then they think they\u2019re going to ship their products back into the United States, we will charge them a tax of 35%. \nSo when you think these companies, which right now are out there negotiating to leave here. They\u2019ll leave New Hampshire. They\u2019ll leave Pennsylvania. They\u2019re gonna leave Ohio. They\u2019re gonna leave all of these places, all of our great places and great states. And right now as we\u2019re talking, they\u2019re negotiating deals. \nMexico is the eighth wonder of the world in terms of the new plants. \nA friend of mine builds plants. He\u2019s the biggest. He said the eighth wonder of the world what\u2019s happening in Mexico. And I say, and I tell this to people, what about us? He said meh, not gonna be \u2014 it\u2019s gonna be the other way around. \nBut there will be consequences. And you know, when they realize that they\u2019ve got to now pay a tax, all of that, to come through our very strong border, because there will be a strong border, with their product, you know what they\u2019re gonna say? They\u2019re gonna say \u201cLet\u2019s stay. We\u2019re not gonna move\u201d, and they\u2019re gonna stay. It\u2019s very simple. \nBut the politicians don\u2019t want to do that because they\u2019re controlled \u2014 they\u2019re controlled by the people that give them their campaign contributions and probably other things. We will \u2014 does anybody know what I mean by that? \nWe will also stand up to Chinese currency manipulation, and we will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \nWe will become a rich nation again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. \nHillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world, and it has now spread into our country. \nThere are right now 1,000 open ISIS investigations across the United States, more than at any time that we\u2019ve ever had. \nNow, Hillary wants to increase by 550% the massive number of Syrian refugees flowing into our country. That\u2019s over the Obama numbers, and those are thousands and thousands of people. \nA Trump administration will suspend the Syrian refugee program. \nAnd we\u2019ll help them with safe havens and we\u2019ll get other countries over there, like the Gulf states who have nothing but money. We have $20 trillion in debt. We\u2019ll get them to pay. They gotta do their share. We\u2019ll lead it. We\u2019ll help. They\u2019ll pay. But you know what? We can\u2019t let people into this country that we don\u2019t know about. We don\u2019t know. \nLet me state this as clearly as I can. If I\u2019m elected president, I am going to keep...When... \nWe love New Hampshire. I love this place. I love this place. \nBy the way, you know, we\u2019re leading in Florida. We\u2019re leading in all these places. \nAnd I learned so much. And I said to the people of New Hampshire that if I win, which I did with New Hampshire. If I win, and I also said, and if I go all the way, we are going to stop the inflow of drugs into New Hampshire and into our country 100%. \nAnd I gave the people of New Hampshire my pledge, more than anybody else in this case, because they really taught me about what\u2019s happening with the world of drugs pouring in. Hard to believe. It\u2019s just so, so strange when you look and see the beauty of this place and then you see that heroin and drugs are your number one problem, by far. \nAnyway, with months these lobbyists sealed over $26 billion in foreign arms deals, including over $19 billion in Qatar. Some people would say Qatar, which happened to be off Bill Clinton $1 million as a birthday gift for a few minutes of face time. $1 million. \nThe lobbyists, one of whom was the sister-in-law to Hillary Clinton\u2019s current campaign chairman, received hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees. The contractor got billions of dollars in contracts. And Hillary Clinton got her campaign cash and money for her foundation. \nAnd you know I\u2019m putting up tremendous amounts of money. Today, I wrote another check for $10 million. I\u2019m spending money like crazy. I\u2019ll probably have over maybe close to or over $100 million of my money spent on the campaign. \nBut there\u2019s something nice about that, unless I lose, in which case I say, \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d \nBut we\u2019re gonna do what\u2019s right for you, not what\u2019s right for some contributor or special interest. \nHillary put the office of the Secretary of State up for sale. And if she ever got the chance, believe me she would put the office \u2014 and you know what office I\u2019m talking about \u2014 the office called the Oval Office up for sale too. \nI propose a contract with the American voter which will end corruption and give government back to our great people. \nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words I\u2019m about to say. And I never loved this expression but now I love it because it\u2019s become \u2014 it\u2019s become the hottest expression. \nIf we win on Nov. 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. \u2014 when we win, okay? \u2014 and we are going to drain the swamp. \nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. You\u2019ve been suffering with the jobs. The jobs have gone like candy being taken from a baby. \nNew growth numbers just released put the average growth rate for this year at a disastrous 1.5%. \nIf China goes down to 7% or 8% GDP, you know it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. \nLast quarter we were at 1%. Our job numbers last week were horrible. They were anemic, as the expression goes. They like to say anemic \u2013 that was the word they used. \nObama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of 3% growth. \nAnd they say it\u2019s hard because we\u2019re a large county. \nWell, India is a much larger country and they\u2019re at 8%. China is at 7%. And China\u2019s not happy. \nSo we\u2019re at around 1% and we just keep going along, just keep going along, losing our jobs to Mexico and every other place. \n47 million Americans are on food stamps, and 45 million people \u2014 think of it, this is our country \u2014 are living in poverty. \nMeanwhile our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year. You say, \u201cWho negotiates these contracts?\u201d \nWe\u2019re living through Obama. It\u2019s true. Obama. Obama. \nYou know, instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton, he ought to be in the White House in the Oval Office negotiating trade deals, beating ISIS, taking care of our veterans, which he does not do. \nHillary bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena. That alone to me \u2013 there were more serious things done, but how does it get much more? But that was so obvious. \nShe gets the subpoena and she bleaches and deletes 33,000 e-mails. \nThat to me \u2014 because it was so simple, you know? Not \u2014 it\u2019s not about the sale of uranium that nobody knows what it means \u2014 I know what it means \u2014 to Russia. \nThen she talks to me about Russia. 20% of the uranium in our country to Russia. \nBut you know, the deletion of 33,000 e-mails, boy, that just sort of is so out there, after receiving a subpoena from the United States government. \nShe lied to Congress. She lied to the FBI. She made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. \nThe Clinton crew gave more than $675,000 to the wife of the deputy director of the FBI, and the man who was overseeing the investigation into Hillary\u2019s illegal server but maybe that takes care of itself. Right now, that takes care of itself, I think. I think. \nVery proud that the FBI was willing to do this actually. Really, very proud. \nJust yesterday we learned that Bill Clinton\u2019s right-hand man pushed for Clinton\u2019s Foundation donors and other large corporations to funnel as much as $66 million in personal profit to Bill and Hillary Clinton. \nThis man explained that the cozy relationship between his consulting firm, foundation, and Clinton\u2019s personal income had helped Bill and Hillary enrich themselves and obtained in-kind services, including personal travel, hospitality, vacations, and the like. \nThe same people paying Bill Clinton for speeches were lobbying Hillary Clinton at the same. The same time, same time. And \u2014 these people are seriously corrupt. Terrible conflict. \nHillary\u2019s pay for play included defense contracts. \nTake Raytheon. When the contractor wanted big foreign arms deals, they hired three lobbyists that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Hillary\u2019s last campaign and are raising money for her current campaign. \nAnd by the way, 50 to 1 in ads. 50 to 1. \nAnd if you look at Florida, we\u2019re winning. Ohio, we\u2019re winning. Iowa we\u2019re winning. Doing great in New Hampshire. I think we\u2019re going to have a tremendous victory in Pennsylvania. We better have a great victory in New Hampshire, please. Okay? I mean, give me a break. \nIn fact, when this news \u2014 when this news of the FBI\u2019s investigation, when it just happened a little while ago, they said, \u201cMr. Trump, I think they\u2019d understand. We could skip your speech in New Hampshire. This is so big.\u201d \nI said, \u201cI don\u2019t have the courage to skip the speech in New Hampshire.\u201d Believe me, I don\u2019t have the courage. I\u2019m not skipping New Hampshire. I never will. \nYou know, when I won, and you remember because I go around and we had the big rallies, and they said \u201cOh, the big rallies will never work in New Hampshire. You have to sit down and have dinner with everybody.\u201d I said that\u2019s like \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of dinners. They don\u2019t expect that. \nBut you remember when we met, and I\u2019d have a lot of small meetings too with people. We\u2019d talk, and New Hampshire more than any other place taught me about drugs flowing into this country. \nAnd your police department, so great, the police departments in New Hampshire, they told me. I went to some, I became friendly with some. And I never knew \u2014 I never knew, honestly, I knew it was bad, I never knew it was so bad. \nAnd I said to the people of New Hampshire, because more than any other place, you look at the beautiful little roadways and lakes and streams, and everything is so beautiful, the trees, and you say how could they have a drug problem here? It doesn\u2019t fit. \nBut I\u2019d sit down with groups, and I said what\u2019s your biggest problem? And I figured they\u2019d say maybe the veterans which are suffering greatly in this area. We understand that. But it was always \u2014 and we\u2019ll solve that problem. But it was always, you know what? It was always heroin. I\u2019d say heroin? What do you mean? \nIt\u2019s a disaster, just like everything else in this administration. \nIt has just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare premiums, including a 116% premium hike to our very good friends in the great state of Arizona. \nEven Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is the craziest thing in the world, where people\nwind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. \nIn Minnesota, where the premium increase will be almost 60%, the Democratic governor said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. \nJonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, admitted it was all a fraud and he said it was passed because of the stupidity of the American voter. \nHey, we\u2019re doing a lot of good work, aren\u2019t we? We\u2019re catching all of these people. We\u2019re doing a good job. Jonathan Gruber, there\u2019s another. See, we didn\u2019t forget. I never forgot Jonathan Gruber. \nI said you know, if I do this, we\u2019re going to run and his name came up and people forget after a week or two. I said I am never going to forget Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare and what he said. So we did not forget. Almost \u2014 can you imagine, it\u2019s like a little more than a week before the election. We didn\u2019t forget the name Jonathan Gruber. \nBut the only real stupidity is that shown by our politicians who passed this monstrosity over the furious objection of certain politicians and the American voter. Job-killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged. \nWhat I\u2019ve just announced previously, it might not be as rigged as I thought. Right? Right? \nThe FBI \u2014 I think they\u2019re going to right the ship, folks. I think they\u2019re going to right the ship. And they\u2019re going to save their great reputation by doing so. \nHillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, destroying American health care forever. She wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. \nI will repeal and replace Obamacare, and we will replace it with a much less expensive plan and a plan that is much, much better. \nJust this year, Hillary Clinton declared Obamacare is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, the Democratic Party, and our country. Well, that was \u2014 that\u2019s turned out to be wrong. \nDo they do anything right? We don\u2019t win anymore. \nWe don\u2019t \u2014 I mean, you\u2019re going to have such a good time starting in \u201917. We\u2019re going to start winning again. We\u2019re going to start winning again. \nBecause it\u2019s turned out, and I\u2019ve been saying this from before it passed, Obamacare is a catastrophe beyond imagination. \nInsurers are leaving. Doctors are quitting. Companies are fleeing. Workers\u2019 hours are being cut. Part-time jobs are all over the place. Those beautiful full-time jobs that you used to have don\u2019t exist. And deductibles are through the roof. You don\u2019t get to use it. \nWe don\u2019t get rid of Obamacare, we have no choice. But if we don\u2019t get rid of it, our health care system is gone forever. We\u2019ll never have another chance. \nAnd by the way, if we don\u2019t win this election, you\u2019re never going to have another chance either, that I can tell you. Never going to happen again. \nRepealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on Nov. 8th. \nBut real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington, and again, maybe that\u2019s happening. Wow. We have a big day. \nNo, think of it, I won my first primary in New Hampshire. And I am getting here and the news this morning is \u2014 this is bigger than Watergate. This is bigger than Watergate, in my opinion. This is bigger than Watergate. \nThank you. Thank you very much. \nWe love New Hampshire, I can tell you that. \nI need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement. \nThe FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new e-mails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s investigation. \nAnd they are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America. \nHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. \nI have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made. \nThis was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood. And it is everybody\u2019s hope that it is about to be corrected. \nSo that is a big announcement that I heard 10 minutes ago, and I guess obviously most of you folks have heard about. \nAnd in all fairness for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less, including just recently four-star General James Cartwright, General Petraeus, and many others. Perhaps finally justice will be done. \nWith that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech? \nWe will talk about borders. Right? We will talk about trade. We\u2019ll bring back our jobs, we\u2019ll strengthen our military. And let\u2019s get going. \nOkay? \nI want to thank General Flynn, he\u2019s a great general, and I want to thank you for being here, general. Thank you very much. \nJust before General Flynn was going up we heard this news. I said, \u201cGeneral get up there and keep them busy. We want to digest what just happened here.\u201d \nThank you, General. \nIn 11 days we are going to win New Hampshire, the state of my first victory. And we are going to win back the White House. \n75% of the American people think our country is on the wrong track and we are going to fix it. We are going to get our country back on the right track, and very, very quickly. \nReal change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare, and that is (inaudible), that is (inaudible). \nWe can\u2019t forget how big a news that is. Okay? We can\u2019t lose track. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Pueblo, Colorado", "text": "So we are going to build a border wall...We\u2019re going to build a wall, and we\u2019re going to stop the drugs, the gangs, the violence from pouring into Colorado. \nWe got a lot of bad people that came in. We have great people that came in, but we have a lot of gang members. We have a lot of drug lords. We have a lot drug sellers. We are going to ship them the hell out, okay? Immediately. \nWe are going to shut down the sanctuary cities that have led to the preventable deaths of so many. \nCases like Kate Steinle murdered in San Francisco by a five-time deported illegal immigrant who should never ever have been here. \nOr cases like Sarah Root killed by an illegal immigrant released and then released again after the killing. \nThere are over two million criminal aliens in this country, and we are going to get them out and get them out fast. \nTo the cartels, the gangs, the drug dealers, I have a simple message for you. Your days are numbered, and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end. \nBut we also have to keep our country safe from terrorism. \nThe terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and New Jersey and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota \u2013 you all saw that last week \u2013 were foreign nationals admitted into our country, as was the mall shooter in Washington. \nOr look at cases like the Boston bombers here on asylum. Or the San Bernardino shooting here on a fiancee visa \u2013  fiancee, nice visa \u2013 from Saudi Arabia, killed 14s people that gave them a baby shower a short while before and she killed them. Not only killed them but many, many, many horribly wounded \u2019till this day. \nOr the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan. Terrorists are infiltrating our country. \nNow, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and countless more refugees from across the Middle East. \nI want to keep your families safe. My job is not to represent foreign countries. My job is to represent the citizens of the United States of America. Putting your jobs, your wages, and your security first. \nAmerica first, remember that. America first. \nIf you\u2019re living in the United States today as a lawful resident or a U.S. citizen, I will ensure you have a safe community, rising wages, and secure immigration system, which is what we want. \nImmigration security is national security. Very important. It\u2019s national security. \nHere are some of the things we will do starting in 2017. \nWe are going to lower your taxes substantially. She\u2019s going to raise your taxes. \nWe\u2019re going to eliminate every unnecessary regulation. \nWe\u2019re going to repeal and replace job killing Obamacare. \nWe will make child care affordable. \nWe\u2019re going to save your Second Amendment, which is under siege. And I have the endorsement of the NRA, very early on. Thank you. \nWe\u2019re going to support the men and women of law enforcement. \nAnd we\u2019re going to appoint justices to the Supreme Court of the United States who will uphold and defend our Constitution. \nWe are going to finally rebuild America. We are going to revitalize America. We are going to unite America. We\u2019re going to come together as a people. \nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God saluting one American flag. \nTogether, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America \u2013 like your cap \u2013 we will make America great again. \nThank you everybody. God bless you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. \nHillary Clinton supports Obamacare and wants to expand it. And Obamacare is an absolute disaster. \nHow much have they raised your premiums in this area? Double. Double. How about triple, quadruple? It\u2019s horrible, and it\u2019s going to die of its own weight. But we are going to terminate it and we are going to replace it, and it is going to be so much better and so much less expensive. \nPremiums in Colorado are set to go up another 20%. The only way to stop this disaster is to vote for Trump. I\u2019m telling you to vote for Trump. They will be going down. \nHillary Clinton also supports the terrible trade deals like Bill Clinton\u2019s NAFTA and China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization. \nAnd next she wants to support Trans-Pacific partnership \u2013 the deal she calls the gold standard. That she lied to during the debate. She said she never called it the gold standard. And Lester Holt kept questioning me on everything, but he never questioned her on that. Right? And it turned out she called it the gold standard and she will approve it if she gets in. \nBut if she gets in, that will be one bad mistake I can tell you. \nColorado has lost more than one in seven manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and China deals. \nBut while you\u2019ve lost out, Hillary Clinton has raked in cash from her contributors. \nShe and Bill have made $150 million dollars in speeches \u2013 and she\u2019s a bad speaker \u2013 to special interests. They gave 39 speeches to big banks, including $2 million in speaking fees to Goldman Sachs. The Clintons received another $2 million from a Swiss Bank after Hillary negotiated a favorable settlement for them as Secretary of State. \nTo hide the corruption, Hillary Clinton puts her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena to hide them from the public. \nShe lies to Congress under oath. And her ring leaders took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals. Explain that one. \nIn so many ways, it\u2019s worse than Watergate. The investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged and it\u2019s a shame. And it\u2019s one of the saddest things that has ever taken place in our nation. Believe me, what\u2019s gone on. \nWe\u2019ve become a Banana Republic. You know what? We have. \nNow today we learned that the FBI may have made a side deal with Clinton\u2019s top aides to destroy their laptops. Did you know this? \nLet me repeat, the FBI reportedly made a deal to destroy the laptops of government officials implicated in a massive criminal cover-up. \nI think you have a lot of great people in the FBI and you do indeed. I think they\u2019re extremely upset at what\u2019s going on. \nHillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels. \nAnd the American people have one chance to stop it \u2013 by showing up and voting on Nov. 8th. \nPeople have had it with the years and decades of Clinton corruption. This is the year the American people say enough is enough. \nThe Clintons are the sordid past. We are together, as a movement all of us, outside of this area, all over the country, we are the bright future. \nNow another issue I want to address today finally is immigration. \nAs I\u2019ve mentioned, Pueblo is filled with wonderful hard working immigrants. It\u2019s these hard working immigrants who stand to lose the most from our open border immigration policy. \nIllegal immigration and broken visa programs take jobs directly from Latino and Hispanic workers living here lawfully today. You know that. They\u2019re taking your jobs. \nIllegal immigration also brings with it massive crime and massive drugs, including a terrible heroin problem right here in Colorado. You have a big problem. \nThat has contributed so much to this country and to this state, amazing place, through the people of Pueblo \u2013 thank you \u2013 and their families. \nWe\u2019ve hailed from all regions \u2013 they\u2019ve come from all regions of the world. You are united by this one very important factor \u2013 you are all Americans. \nAnd as Americans, you\u2019re entitled to the same protections as every other American gets. \nEveryone living lawfully inside our borders are entitled to the same things \u2013 safe communities, a great education, and access to high paying jobs and really good jobs. \nAnd this isn\u2019t happening...[inaudible] change that I will deliver. \nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years delivering nothing but talk and failure. \nYou know the other night when we\u2019re at the debate, I noticed more than ever before, we\u2019re at the debate and she says she\u2019s going to do this or this or this or that. And I said to myself, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t she been doing it for 30 years?\u201d Right? Just talk. \nHer policies have brought death and destruction overseas and poverty at home. \nShe\u2019s brought massive poverty for everyone, but especially for African American and Latino citizens. \nShe comes in, tries to get their vote. Although I must tell you the enthusiasm for her is very small. \nDon King, the great boxing promotor, who endorsed me, said \u201cDonald, the African-Americans, Donald, love you.\u201d Don King, big Don. \nAnd here\u2019s a man whether you like him or not that\u2019s a smart cookie, a tough cookie, and he\u2019s done a job, he\u2019s done a job. \nBut he said, \u201cYou are going to see a big surprise on Nov. 8th with\u201d \u2013 and in this case he was talking about the African Americans \u2013 he said, \u201cYou going to see a big surprise because so many African-American people love you, and they want you to really help them out in terms of the inner cities in particular where it\u2019s so dangerous, where education is so bad, where jobs are non existent, where youth cannot get jobs.\u201d \nSo I want to thank Don King and so many others for their endorsement. \nWe had so many others so many reverends and pastors. Bishop Jackson from Detroit, incredible people. Darrell Scott, Pastor Darrell Scott, so many, and I\u2019m so honored by it. Believe me, I am honored by it. \nAnd Don said that Hillary Clinton takes the African-American vote for granted. \nHere\u2019s the bad news, I don\u2019t think their gonna want to go out and vote for her. This is not Barack Obama where they really had spirit to vote for him. Nobody has spirit. \nRemember she called African-American male youth \u201csuper predators\u201d? Who wants to vote for her? She\u2019s not going to do the job anyway. \nShe opposes school choice, and she wants to trap African-American and Latino children into the failing government schools because she\u2019s getting a lot of money from the teacher\u2019s unions. So, she doesn\u2019t want to have choice. And she doesn\u2019t want to end Common Core so we can bring education locally, which is very important. She doesn\u2019t want to do that. \nWe\u2019re going to get poor minority...[inaudible]... \nI\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m telling you the Commission on Presidential Debates is operating this microphone. \nEvery time the Secret Service hears that sound they go \u201cWhoa!\u201d \nNo, that Commission on Presidential Debates, what a joke they are. I got to go through them on Sunday night again. \nAnd by the way Mike Pence on Tuesday night. He has been fantastic. Governor Mike Pence, what a fantastic guy. Tuesday night! Tuesday night! \nWe are going to get poor minority children out of failing schools and then into the public, private charter or magnet school of their choice. Going to be a big difference. \nI\u2019ll tell you the Latino children, the African-American children, it\u2019s going to be some difference, believe me, some difference. \nAnd that\u2019s what I do, and that\u2019s what we have to do right now, because our country is under tremendous pressure. \nWhen the pressure is on, when the odds are stacked against me and you, because many of you people are the same way, when people say it can\u2019t be done, that\u2019s when we just get started. We\u2019re going to change things around. \nThe thing that motivates me the most is when people tell me something is absolutely impossible. For me, impossible is just a starting point. That\u2019s when you begin. \n...With $20 trillion in debt and a $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities, a lot of people say it\u2019s impossible. \nWe are sitting on a big, fat, ugly bubble. And Obama doesn\u2019t allow our Fed to raise interest rates, because when those interest rates go, you watch what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s going to be very unattractive. He\u2019ll be out playing golf some place. \nBut you know what? They\u2019re wrong in what they are doing, and it\u2019s unfair to the people. It\u2019s unfair to the country. \n...From the depths of that terrible real estate depression, I created a company worth billions and billions of dollars and created tens of thousands of jobs. \nOur company, our employees, we actually re-made skylines together, revitalized neighborhoods, rejuvenated communities, and hired thousands and thousands of workers. \nOn Nov. 8th, America\u2019s comeback begins, and we need a comeback. \nAnd we are going to rise up from our present challenges, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. \nA lot of people said \u201cWhy are you going to Pueblo?\u201d \nI said, number one I like the state. Number one everything about Pueblo says winner, including what Dwight Eisenhower said long ago. \nAnd they said, \u201cDo you think they will like you in Pueblo?\u201d I said I think so. \nThey said, \u201cWell, you have a lot of Hispanics/Latinos in Pueblo.\u201d I said I think that\u2019s why they are going to like me actually. That\u2019s why they are going to like me. Believe me. \nWhen you look at what\u2019s happening with the African-American community, when you look at what\u2019s happening with the Hispanic community, very, very unfair. Very, very unfair. \nThank you. \nThe people here in Pueblo know what it takes to rebuild this country. \nThis is the city with \u2013 friend or foe, friend or foe? Well, he\u2019s got a very weak voice so you can let him stay. But just be good. sir, be nice, be nice. We all love you. You\u2019re on the other side. \nYou know the Bernie Sanders people had so much more spirit in them and vigor than the Hillary people. The Hillary people are not in the same category. \nIf Bernie Sanders had not made the deal with the devil, he would have gone down in the history of politics as a very rare and unique person. \nBut when he made that deal, and I know that he wished he didn\u2019t, his followers were lost. He had an event recently where 150 people showed up to hear him talk. \nAnd I will say this, we\u2019ve always had by far the biggest crowds. But you know what? He was second. He was second. \nBut he made a deal with the devil and his supporters are really no longer his supporters any longer. That I can tell you. \nAnd you know one of the things that Bernie Sanders and I agreed on is trade. \nAnd trade is something that is so sad for our country. What\u2019s happening, how your jobs are being taken. \nThe difference is, I can do something about it and make a bad deal into a great deal. All he knew is it was bad. And we want to do something about it. We just can\u2019t be a critic. \nThis is a city with a rich immigrant history and a rich Latino history. \nThe Latinos love Trump, right? \nIn the early 90\u2019s, they splashed the front pages with stories about how Donald Trump, me, they said I was finished. Everybody said that I was done. \nThere were front page articles in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, among many others. They were thrilled and delighted. \nAnd I\u2019m still here. Can you believe these people? They must be going crazy. Can you believe it? The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, they are going crazy. They say 1990\u2019s and now here I am still. They say \u201cCan we ever get rid of this guy?\u201d \nBut they were thrilled to write these negative stories. So they said I was finished. \nThe only person who didn\u2019t think that I was in trouble was a guy named Donald J. Trump. I didn\u2019t think I was in trouble. \nI sort of didn\u2019t know what they were talking about. Does that make sense? Power of positive thinking. But I didn\u2019t know what they were talking about. \nI started my company with a small loan, and as I grew I borrowed money to grow the company. And big money from big banks. \nWhen the bottom fell out from the real estate market, I had this large amount of debt and it stayed the same but the value of assets plummeted. So you have to learn. I was young so you have to learn. And I learned, and I worked really hard. \nBut I knew how to use the tax code to rebuild my company when others didn\u2019t. \nI knew how to understand, and I fully understood the banks and the bankers and how to deal with them. I knew a lot. \nBut my understanding of the tax code gave me a tremendous advantage over those who didn\u2019t have a clue about it, including many of my competitors who lost everything they had, never to be heard from again. Never. They were never heard from again. \nSome people that I knew, they were good, they were doing a good job, never ever to be heard from again. \nNow they\u2019re gone and I\u2019m here and I\u2019m ready to turn things around for our country. \nWe\u2019re going to do it. The early 90\u2019s was a very tough time for the world. But in tough times, you need very tough and very smart people. \nThese are tough times for America. And I will tell you, we need very tough and very smart leadership. Not people who tell you what you want to hear, but people who tell you what you need to hear. \nWe must never allow corrupt career politicians like the Clintons ever back into the White House again. \nThese tough times were when I performed my very best. \nThe economy and banks, they were collapsing. The government was a mess. But I enjoyed waking up everyday to go to battle, and that\u2019s what it was for three years. \nI had an expression in the early 90\u2019s, \u201cSurvive until \u201995 and you\u2019ll be okay.\u201d And people copied it. Survive till \u201995. \nI enjoyed getting up every morning to take on the financial establishment on behalf of my company, my employees, my family and myself and win. And that\u2019s what we did. I won, I won, and I kept on winning, \u2018till this day. I kept on winning. \nAll you have to do is ask all of the 17 people that we competed against and you\u2019ll ask them, \u201cHow did Trump do?\u201d They\u2019ll say, \u201cHe won.\u201d \nBut that\u2019s the thinking we need for our country. That\u2019s the thinking we need when we\u2019re negotiating trade deals, which are horrible. And military deals and economic deals on behalf of the American people. \nWe need great people negotiating our deals for us. \nWe have the greatest negotiators and the greatest business people in the world. And we use political hacks to negotiate our deals. Not anymore we\u2019re not. Not anymore. \nPut me into the boardroom as your representatives, and I promise I will deliver. \nHillary Clinton is in it only for herself, her donors, and her special interests. \nI\u2019m fighting for America. \nMany people have said over the years that I perform better under pressure than anyone they\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019ve proven that over and over again. \nOh, oh. I thought that was the commission on presidential debates. That was what...I said I didn\u2019t know they were here. You know, when they were playing with the mic back and forth I thought that was the commission? I thought that\u2019s a beautiful commission. \nLet\u2019s see what happens on Sunday again. My biggest opponent was the microphone. \nAnd now our country is in need of a major comeback. It needs one now just about more than ever. \nWe owe $20 trillion in debt, doubled during Obama\u2019s period as president. Doubled. Think of it. \nBut that\u2019s only part of the story. We have over $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities, and we have a budget that\u2019s out of control with annual deficits. \nIn addition, because of the incompetence of our leaders, we run massive trade deficits on an annual basis. \nI\u2019ll get Bernie to negotiate a couple of these trade deals, you\u2019ll find out. \nAnd we now have almost $800 billion a year in trade deficits. \nAnd you say to yourself, who are these people that negotiating our deals? \nOur country is broke. It\u2019s broke. \nAnd the worst part is that with all of the money we spend so foolishly all over the world, stupidly all over the world \u2013 we protect the other countries with tremendous \u2013 I mean tremendous \u2013 losses. \nAnd we want to protect countries, but they should pay us the proper amount. Why should we be losing money? \nBut think of it, with all of the money that we spend and with $20 trillion in debt, and all of the things we do and all of the talk and all of the political nonsense, we have a decaying infrastructure. We have failing schools. We have rising crime. \nWe have a depleted military \u2013 are great people and a depleted military. \nWe have planes that are so old they go to airplane graveyards to take out parts. They go to museums to take out parts \u2018cause they don\u2019t make the parts anymore. \nWe have an open border. We have an economy that can\u2019t create full time high paying jobs. Because our jobs \u2013 our great jobs \u2013 many of them have been taken. \nAnd we will build the wall. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re going to build the wall. We\u2019re going to build the wall. We\u2019re going to build the wall. We\u2019re going to build the wall. \nWe\u2019re going to build the wall. Mexico is going to pay for the wall. They don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re going to pay for the wall. \nAnd you have a tremendous problem right here. But we\u2019re going to have drugs stop pouring into our country, destroying our youth, poisoning our people. Poisoning our people. \nWe are a divided nation, and each week it seems we\u2019re getting more and more divided with race riots on our streets on a monthly basis. \nSomebody said don\u2019t call them race riots, but that\u2019s what they are. They\u2019re race riots. And it\u2019s happening more and more. \nYou looked at Charlotte, a great city where I have property. A great city. You look at different places around our country. St. Louis, Ferguson, Baltimore, Chicago. \nIn Chicago, thousands of shootings, thousands since Jan. 1st. 4,000 shootings, think of it, since January. \nThis is not the America that was handed down to us, and it\u2019s not the America that we want to leave to our children. And it\u2019s certainly not the America we want to pass down to our grandchildren. \nBut this is the America we will have if we don\u2019t turn things around starting immediately. We don\u2019t have much time, folks. We don\u2019t have much time. \nAnd if we don\u2019t win this election, it will never happen again. This opportunity is never going to happen again. \nWhat I say is not lost on the American people because 70% of you believe our country is headed in the wrong direction. \nAnd I\u2019m trying to figure out who the other 30% are. I want to meet them. \nWe cannot have another four years of Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton will be worse. She will be worse. \nWe can turn our country around. But if we don\u2019t make a change in leadership right now, it will never happen. \nThe failed political establishment must go. It must go for the sake of your country, your future, and those you love the most. \nAnd when people make the mistake of underestimating me, that\u2019s when they are really in for their biggest surprise. Same thing with a lot of the people in this room. \nJust look at what happened in the primary. Remember the primary? \n\u201cTrump\u2019s running. Oh, don\u2019t worry about it. He\u2019s the star of The Apprentice. He built a nice company. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d \nJust look at what happened. Our incredible movement is doing, just take a look, this is a movement, folks. A movement like they\u2019ve never seen. \nWhat we\u2019ve done is amazing, and now we have one person left, crooked Hillary, and we have to beat her on Nov. 8th. \nAnd you have to get out and vote, and you have to get out and make calls, and you have to do. \nAnd jokingly I like to say, \u201cIf you\u2019re sick, if you get the absolute worst prognosis from the doctor, and it looks like maybe you\u2019re not even going to make it, it doesn\u2019t make a damn bit of difference. Get up and vote on Nov. 8th.\u201d \nBut the reason I never felt endangered, really and I never did, I never felt endangered during the real estate downturn \u2013 I guess I didn\u2019t read the stories \u2013 was that I knew myself, I knew my business, I knew the financial system, I knew the tax code, and most importantly I knew how to fight. Because that\u2019s what you had to do. That was fighting. And that\u2019s what I am, I\u2019m a fighter. \nAnd I\u2019m now going to fight for you. I\u2019m not fighting for me anymore. I\u2019m fighting for you, fighting for you. \nWith my knowledge, I knew that I would make a comeback without question. I never had a doubt in my mind. \nAnd, again, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t even think of it as a comeback. It was just like, you know, we had tough periods, good periods, tough periods. We just knew that things were going to be just fine. \nBut that is why I\u2019m here today. \nThank you, darling. And I\u2019m praying for you and I love you. Great people. Now I get the whole hero thing. Now I get it. \nBut that is why I have left private business to go into public life. \nIf you would have ever told me that I was going to be doing this \u2013 now had I known I was going to be doing this I would have commenced with certain television interviews, radio interviews, I would have said things slightly differently. And I wouldn\u2019t have had as good a time in life and as much fun in life, but it would have made my life as a politician a little bit easier, right? \nAnd you know, these people, holier than thou, they never say anything around the breakfast room table, do they, do they? They never do. \nBill and Hillary never say anything like this around the breakfa \u2013 can you imagine what they say? \nWell, they talk about deplorables and irredeemables, right? They talk about that. \nYou\u2019re deplorable. You\u2019re irredeemable. I think irredeemable might be worse if you think. Everyone talks about, ugh, deplorable. Ay yai yai. \nThese are the greatest people in this room and many other rooms like it. We\u2019ve seen hundreds of thousands of people. These are the greatest people. \nAnd really, importantly, we\u2019re going to make it great for all of the people. It\u2019s not my people, or people that are voting for me. We\u2019re going to make it great for all of our people in this country. \nBut I\u2019m doing this, and I\u2019m doing it for a very specific reason, because I understand our country is in very, very bad shape. \nThat\u2019s all right. Sounds like a nice person. \nPeople like my opponent Hillary Clinton whose only \u2013 \nFolks, let\u2019s win on Nov. 8th. Okay? Let\u2019s just. \nAnyway, her only method of making money is by selling government favors and granting access to special interests. Know nothing about how businesses succeed and grow. Hillary Clinton has never created a single job in her entire life. \nBy the way, we have somebody who has. Where\u2019s Bernie Marcus? Where\u2019s Bernie? Bernie Marcus, founder of Home Depot. Go to Home Depot. He only created about hundreds of thousands. How many jobs does Home Depot produce right now, Bernie? \nMillions, that\u2019s a lot of jobs. A great guy, a great man. An unbelievable entrepreneur, and somebody that put a lot of people to work, and Home Depot is a terrific company. And thank you for being here, Bernie. I appreciate it. Thank you. \nThey haven\u2019t added a single dollar of value, people like Hillary, to the American economy. \nHillary Clinton hasn\u2019t made an honest dollar in her entire life. \nAll she does is takes from you, takes from your country and peddles influence to donors, special interests, and foreign actors, for astronomical dollars like you\u2019ve never seen before. It\u2019s corruption of the highest order. You know it, I know it, she knows it, and plenty of other people know it but they\u2019re not doing anything about it. \nWell, I made my money as a very successful private business person, following the law all the way. \nHillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official, breaking the law and putting her government office up for sale. And now she\u2019s running for president. \nBy her own account, Hillary Clinton left the White House, dead broke. She said \u201cdead broke\u201d. \nAnd then remember, she became a Senator for New York, did nothing. Remember the jobs she was going to produce? She never produced them. \nAnd then she became Secretary of State. \nAnd now, she and her husband have made more than $200 million without building a company or creating a single thing of value. \nDuring the early \u201890s, as companies went absolutely bust. They were collapsing all over the place, left and right, the media and powers that be said, \u201cDonald Trump, he could never, ever make it back.\u201d \nOh I remember those stories. We were all. How many people then were in trouble like everybody was in trouble? \nBut they said, and they were so gleeful, \u201cHe could never make it back.\u201d They said I had billions of dollars in borrowing, which is true. And hundreds of millions dollars in personal guarantees, which is true. And no pathway out, which is false. \nThat was a bad time. That was an ugly time. Lot of people you\u2019ll never hear from them again from that period. \nBut I never had any doubts whatsoever. And most importantly I never ever gave up or thought about giving up. \nThat\u2019s because I knew in my heart that when the chips are down is when I perform the very best. That is always when I perform the best. It\u2019s when I make my best decisions, judgments. \nYou remember Bernie saying Hillary Clinton has bad judgement? \nAnd honestly my single greatest asset probably is temperament because if you didn\u2019t have the right temperament, you could have never escaped that financial jungle. That\u2019s for sure. \nSingle greatest asset is my temperament. And I have a temperament for winning. You have to win. We have a temperament all of us for winning. \nI understand the tax laws better than almost anyone, which is why I am one who can truly fix them. I understand it. I get it. \nAnd that is what I commit to do. We want fairness. We want money brought in. And we want money to be spent when it goes out because they spend our tax dollars so unfairly and unwisely. Remember that. \nAs a businessman and real estate developer, I have legally used the tax laws to my benefit and to the benefit of my company, my investors, and my employees. \nI mean honestly, I have brilliantly \u2013 I have brilliantly used those laws. \nI have often said on the campaign trail that I have a fiduciary responsibility to pay no more tax than is legally required like anybody else. Or put it another way, to pay as little tax as legally possible. \nAnd I must tell you, I hate the way they spend our tax dollars. And believe me, that makes a difference. \nAs a major real estate developer in this country and throughout the world, I face enormous taxes \u2013 city taxes, state taxes, sales taxes, excise taxes, employee taxes, federal taxes, VAT taxes (different countries). \nIt\u2019s my job to minimize the overall tax burden to the greatest extent possible, which allows me to re-invest in neighborhoods and in workers and build amazing properties, which fuel tremendous growth in their communities, and always help our great providers of jobs and we have to help our small businesses. What it\u2019s all about. What it\u2019s all about. \nThe news media is now obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the 1990\u2019s at the end of one of the most brutal economic downturns in our country\u2019s history. \nIf you remember the early 90\u2019s, other than I would say 1928, there was nothing even close. \nThe conditions facing real estate developers in that early \u201990 period were almost as bad as the Great Depression of 1929 and far worse than the Great Recession of 2008. Not even close. \nWhat had been a booming economy in the era of Ronald Reagan changed dramatically and the business landscape changed with it. Bank failures and collapse. The absolute total destruction of the savings and loan industry. And the implosion of the retail market and real estate in general. Something we\u2019ve never seen anything like it. \nMany businesspeople, including many of my competitors and some of my friends, were not able to survive. \nCompanies, jobs, and opportunities were lost, and lives were destroyed as tens of thousands of people were put out of work. \nSome of the biggest and strongest people and companies went absolutely bankrupt, which I never did by the way. Are you proud of me? I would have loved to use that card but I just didn\u2019t want to do it. \nThank you. \nYet today, my company is bigger, stronger, far greater assets than it\u2019s ever had before. More premium properties. We\u2019ve never done better. It\u2019s the strongest we\u2019ve ever been. \nAnd we employ thousands of people, and over the years have employed thousands and thousands of people, which is a thing that frankly makes me most happy. \nThat did not happen by chance or luck. It happened by action and talent \u2013 lot of talent. \nI was able to use the tax laws of this country and my business acumen to dig out of the real estate mess. You would call it a depression. When few others were able to do what I did in those most \u2013 I\u2019m a star. Thank you. You are too \u2013 Oh, they were amazing times. \nIn those most difficult times when so many had their backs to the wall, I reached within myself and delivered for my company, my employees, my family, and the communities where my properties existed, and I really delivered. \n...Thank you. \nIt is so great to be here in Pueblo, Colorado. We love Pueblo. And those two gentlemen are amazing men and I want to thank them for being with us. \nYou know, Pueblo is called home of the heroes. Did you know that? Because of your proud tradition of military service. \nPueblo\u2019s the home of four Medal of Honor recipients and I just got the endorsement of 19 altogether, 19. So when you have 19, that\u2019s pretty good. \nBut you have 4 which is amazing. As President Eisenhower said, \u201cThere must be something in the water out here in Pueblo\u201d. Because all of you guys turn out to be heroes. What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s going on? Is there something in the water? Give me some of that water. \nColorado is home to six military bases. We\u2019re going to eliminate the defense sequester and rebuild our military. We\u2019re going to strengthen it. We\u2019re gonna make it truly, truly, strong again. \nAnother great Colorado legacy is hunting and fishing. \nMy sons know that very well. They\u2019re here all the time. \nWe\u2019re going to conserve your lands for the future generations, and we\u2019re going to save your Second Amendment, which is under siege. \nYou know, a lot of people in this room, this is very impressive. \nThank you.  Thank you. It\u2019s a great honor. It\u2019s a great honor. \nOne other issue of such great importance in Colorado is energy. \nCrooked Hillary Clinton wants to shut down the mines and shut down shale and shut down oil and natural gas, and we\u2019re going to end the war on American energy, and we are going to put the miners back to work. They have to be put back to work. \nI\u2019ve also made a centerpiece of my economic revitalization plan the largest middle class tax cuts since Ronald Reagan and the largest regulatory reform in American history. We\u2019re gonna do that. \nAnd Hillary Clinton is going to increase your taxes very, very substantially, and she admits it. At least she admits it. \nBut that\u2019s because I know how over taxed and over regulated the working people and companies in this country are. \nA central issue I would like to address today is our broken tax code, an issue of concern to all Americans, along with securing our borders, rebuilding our military, keeping us safe from terrorism, re-doing our trade deals and bringing back jobs \u2013 they\u2019re sort of one and the same. \nFixing our broken tax code is one of the main reasons I\u2019m running for president. \nI\u2019ve been saying from the beginning of this campaign, how ridiculous, complex and, yes, unfair the tax system is. It is an unfair system. And so complex that very few people understand it. Fortunately, I understand it. \nThis is not the fault of the IRS, but the political class that is owned outright by the special interests and lobbyists. Believe me. \nIt\u2019s these politicians who wrote the tax code and who are constantly adding, revising, and changing an already over complicated set of laws \u2013 all at the behest of their favorite donors and special interests who want certain provisions put in and they won\u2019t take no for an answer. It\u2019s thousands of pages long and almost no one understands it. \nThe average American would need an army of accountants and lawyers to wade through and wade through it. \nMany so called experts, due to the sheer size and complexity of the code, don\u2019t have a clue what these pages represent. These are experts. They get paid and they don\u2019t even know what it represents. \nThe unfairness of the tax laws is unbelievable. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been talking about for a long time despite quite frankly being a big beneficiary of the laws. But I\u2019m working for you now. I\u2019m not working for Trump. \nBelieve me. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks on donations to veterans groups", "text": "Question:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nHere\u2019s the way I look at it. \nWhen I have somebody that\u2019s not on my side, when you know \u2013 by the way, I\u2019ve gotten great applause from the press in terms of as an achievement because the Republican Party is really well unified. \nWe have come up. People that you would have never thought possible are now saying, \u201cI support Trump.\u201d So remember that. We don\u2019t talk about that too much. \nBut actually last week, the big story was how fast the Republican Party is healing because it is a healing process. It was a rough \u2013 that was a rough campaign... \nI can this. The real is how fast we\u2019re getting together. \nNow, if I have a Republican who\u2019s not on my side, I\u2019m not going to be \u2013 why should I be particularly nice to that person? I\u2019m not going to go after it like I would Hillary or Crazy Bernie. But you know what? Why should I be nice to that person if I have a person that\u2019s not going to support me? I have no obligation. \nPolitically, I may be right. I may be wrong. But that\u2019s who I am. I\u2019m a very honest person... \nIf somebody is going to say a little bit negative or a lot negative about me and if they happen to be Republican, I may choose to hit them back. Not always. But I may choose to hit them back. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd if you read the front page of the Wall Street Journal about Mitt Romney, he looks like a fool. \nLook, I\u2019m not a fan of Mitt Romney. Just so you understand. I raised a lot of money for Mitt Romney. I made robocalls for Mitt Romney. I made speeches for him. He let us down. \nIf you read the front page of the Wall Street Journal this weekend, Mitt Romney looks like a fool. \nNow, what would I say good about Mitt Romney? \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd by the way, more money is coming in. I wasn\u2019t looking for the credit. \nBut I had no choice but to do this because the press was saying I didn\u2019t raise any money for them. \nNot only did I raise it, much of it was given a long time ago. And there is a vetting process and I think you understand that. \nBut when I raise almost $6 million and probably in the end will raise more than six because more is going to come in and is coming in. But when I raise $5.6 million as of today, more is coming in. And this is going to phenomenal groups. \nAnd I have many of these people vetting the people getting the money and working hard. And then we have to read probably libelous stories or certainly close in the newspapers and the people know the stories are false, I\u2019m going to continue to attack the press. \nLook, I find the press to be extremely dishonest. I find the political press to be unbelievably dishonest. I will say that. \nOkay, thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nBecause I don\u2019t care... \nI have a judge who\u2019s very, very unfair. \nWell, you\u2019ll see it in court documents. But I have a judge who\u2019s very, very unfair. He knows he\u2019s unfair. And I\u2019ll win the Trump University case. I can settle that case. I could have settled it. I just choose not to. \nIn fact, when I ran this, they said why didn\u2019t you settle up that case? I don\u2019t want to settle the case. \nBecause you know what? Because I\u2019m a man of principle. And most of the people that took those courses have letters saying they thought it was great essentially. It was good. It was great. \nAnd you know what? When they\u2019re on the stand and you say \u201cHow come you signed the letter saying that Trump University was so good? How come you signed the letter?\u201d \nThe woman that was the original plaintiff in the case \u2013 they went to the court and the judge allowed her to get out of the case. The case should have been dropped. The whole case should have been dropped. \nThey wanted her dismissed from the case. You know why? Because she was deposed, she was such a bad witness that we\u2019d win the case easily. She signed a letter and she\u2019s on film. She\u2019s on tape like these cameras saying unbelievably good things about Trump University. So they didn\u2019t want her anymore because she\u2019s a disaster for them. \nSo they went to the judge and they said \u201cYour honor, we\u2019d like to have her not be a participant, not be a plaintiff in the case.\u201d And he said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s okay.\u201d She\u2019s the one that started the case. \nNow, they don\u2019t even want her to testify. They don\u2019t want her to testify because she\u2019s a disaster. She has all sorts of beautiful statements about it. And importantly, she\u2019s on tape saying how great it is. They don\u2019t want her. I wouldn\u2019t want her either. \nNow, I could have settled that case. I could settle that case. I can settle that case. I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019ll go through the process. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \n...Here\u2019s what happens. What happens is you will not have \u2013 and very importantly \u2013 you will not have Supreme Court justices. You\u2019re going to lose. You could have as many as four or five. That\u2019s over. \nNow, [Bill] Kristol\u2019s the one that\u2019s \u2013 but he\u2019s the last one. Don\u2019t forget, he said \u201cTrump will never run.\u201d The guy\u2019s not a smart person. He said, \u201cDonald Trump would never run.\u201d Remember? \nYou remember? I actually blame you. Why do you put this guy on television? I see him on the different shows. He\u2019s got no credibility. Said I won\u2019t run. If I run, I won\u2019t do well. If I do well, this and that. He looks like such a fool. \nI saw him on one show. He\u2019s practically crying because he can\u2019t justify. \nNow he comes out with a tweet over the weekend \u2013 over Memorial Day weekend \u2013 it sounds like he\u2019s going to put somebody up. Even I thought it. I thought, \u201cOh, they\u2019re going to find indie.\u201d \nNow he comes out with something saying he was almost \u2013 almost \u2013 kidding. Okay? \nLet me tell you, these people are losers. He\u2019s trying to make you \u2013 he\u2019s trying to drive you guys a little bit nuts. \nIf they do an indie, assuming it\u2019s decent, which I don\u2019t think anybody with a reputation would do it because they\u2019d look like fools. But what you\u2019re going to do is you lose the election for the Republicans and therefore you lose the Supreme Court, therefore you will have a group of people put on the Supreme Court where this country will never ever recover. It will never, ever be the same. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWait, wait, wait. Bill Kristol is a loser. His magazine is failing, as you know. It\u2019s going to be down \u2013 I don\u2019t think it even survives. He\u2019s getting some free publicity. \nBut Bill Kristol \u2013 I\u2019ve been watching this for two years. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t going to run.\u201d Then I go into a race, we go into New Hampshire. \u201cOh, he\u2019s not going to win New Hampshire.\u201d I win in a landslide. Every place I went I was not going to win. But I win in a landslide. Do you think maybe he doesn\u2019t like me? \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nYou look at what\u2019s happening in Phoenix and different places throughout the country where they\u2019re catching people stealing and they don\u2019t even fire them, where people are waiting five days, six days, seven days on line. They\u2019re dying while they wait on line. \nAnd I am in favor of if they can\u2019t get to a doctor within a reasonable period of time, they\u2019re going to see a doctor and the country\u2019s going to pay for it. They\u2019re going to go to a private doctor or a public hospital and a public doctor but some place that can take them immediately. We\u2019re losing thousands of people waiting on line. \nAnd the Veterans Administration is run by Obama just as incompetently as he\u2019s running our country. \nYou look at the TSA, you look at what\u2019s going on at the airports and you look at that. Okay? Just take a look at that. That\u2019s like the Veterans Administration. \nNothing in our country works anymore. It\u2019s a mess. \nAnd maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing so well in the polls. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd by the way, that\u2019s going to be a lot less expensive. And we\u2019ll check it out and be careful. But that\u2019s going to be a lot less expensive than what\u2019s going on. \nThese people are living in hell. \nAnd Hillary Clinton said the Veterans Administration is working just fine. And the head of it, [Bob] McDonald said last week that waiting in line is not bad \u2013 look at Disney World. Okay? These are the kind of people we have running things. It\u2019s ridiculous. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd I think if you people will say I\u2019m the one that came up with the term \u201crigged\u201d. I used it for myself, except that I won by such big margins that the whole system is rigged on both sides. With the Republicans it\u2019s less obvious. With Democrats with the whole super delegate thing, it\u2019s ridiculous. \nSo I think that they\u2019re going to have to make that determination. \nIf you\u2019re asking me who I prefer running against? \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd many of the other groups were upset. They received $100,000 in the mail. They didn\u2019t even know what it was for. It was from me. Other groups received $200,000, $250,000. They didn\u2019t know what it was for. \nAnd again, upstairs I have received phones calls with people crying. I have received letters \u2013 heartfelt letters. \n...The bad part about the dishonesty of the media is that people like me will be inclined not to do it anymore. Because why should you raise $5.6 million and I think I\u2019ll go over $6 million pretty easily. Nobody said that we started this out as a small little project where it was less than $1 million because it kept just mushrooming and building and building. But nobody talks about that. \nSo we raised $5.6 million. We have so many happy groups. So many happy veterans. \nAnd then I see these Hillary Clinton people outside. Now, of course, they don\u2019t know the extent. They probably figured based on reading the press that Trump didn\u2019t make, you know, didn\u2019t raise this kind of money. \nBut we raised a lot and I\u2019ll be raising more and we\u2019ll be sending it to other people as we get along. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd I think when the press portrays it differently, the press is being very dishonest. So I don\u2019t like that. I don\u2019t like dishonesty. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nJeff Sessions is a person that I believe that Ted Cruz has the most respect for and I think Ted thought that he would get an endorsement. \nYou know, Jeff Sessions has never endorsed a presidential candidate before as many years as he\u2019s been in the Senate. \nSo you know, Jeff Sessions is certainly somebody that I would consider. Absolutely. He\u2019s a fantastic person. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nYou have a child, a young child, at stake. You know, it\u2019s too bad there wasn\u2019t another way. \nI thought it was so beautiful to watch that powerful almost 500 pound gorilla and the way he dealt with that little boy. But it just takes one second. It\u2019s one second \u2013 it\u2019s not like it takes place over \u2013 well, he\u2019s going to do it 30 seconds from now. It just takes one little flick of his finger. And I will tell you they probably had no choice. \nBut wait a minute. The point is law enforcement \u2013 these people didn\u2019t allow you to have any more people. \n...I had a tremendous crowd but it was the biggest crowd you could have had. It was all cordoned off. You weren\u2019t allowed to have any more. You weren\u2019t allowed to have any more people than that. \nSo instead of saying Trump made a speech in front of a packed crowd, they said \u201cTrump was disappointed\u201d because I didn\u2019t have millions of people going from Jefferson to Washington. I mean, give me a break. \n...Honestly, it\u2019s dishonest reporting. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \n...I could have asked all these groups \u2013 he just showed up. I just saw him. But I could have asked all these groups to come here and they could have made \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to do that. \nI\u2019m not looking for credit. But what I don\u2019t want is when I raise millions of dollars have people say like this sleazy guy over here from ABC \u2013 he\u2019s a sleaze in my book. You\u2019re a sleaze because you know the facts and you know the facts well. \nVeteran:\nThank you, Mr. Trump. \nFirst of all for the record, I\u2019m a state representative from New Hampshire, 10 years on the veterans affairs committee, 22 years in the Marine Corps, retired First Sergeant. \nWhat I want to clarify here first of all, I would never ever in a million years put my name on a candidate that did not from his heart look me in the eye and tell me he\u2019s concerned about veterans. That\u2019s Donald Trump. I met him over a year ago. \nI\u2019ve been involved in many fundraisers. There are many scammers out there. He did the right thing by vetting these groups there. \nIf you look at some of the groups, they\u2019re given 20 cents, 40 cents on the dollar and they\u2019re spending the rest for you know their nice lavish trips. He gave 100%. \nThe liberal media is the only ones that have been calling the foundation. All right? I\u2019m a former chairman. I\u2019ve been dealing with this stuff for years as a veterans activist. \nStop using veterans as a political pawns. You\u2019ve got a guy outside...go do a Google search on his Facebook. He\u2019s out there. His pictures with Clinton. \nThey are using veterans as political pawns. It must stop. \nDonald Trump is doing this with a heart. You\u2019re all focused on the way he\u2019s raising money and you\u2019re not looking at the 22 veterans that are killing each other everyday. You\u2019re not concerned about the thousands of veterans that are on waitlists. \nLook at his plans on his Trump website. He talks about medical cards. He talks about fixing the VA. He talks about competition. \nI think the liberal media and I\u2019ve been dealing with you a long time. You need to get your head out of your butt. Focus on the real issues. \nThank you. \nI had people \u2013 teams of people \u2013 reviewing statistics, reviewing numbers and also talking to people in the military to find out whether or not the group was deserving of the money. \nWe have given to groups that are unbelievable groups. And honestly, I wish you could hear the phone calls and see the letters. They are so happy. And I\u2019m happy to do it. I didn\u2019t want the credit for it but it was very unfair that the press treated us so badly. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd then I see a few guys standing out there. They don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re there for. They have no idea. They\u2019re there because Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign sent them. \nAnd actually I think it was you or one of you that found out that they actually were with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, which was interesting but I wasn\u2019t surprised. \nI don\u2019t want the credit for it but I shouldn\u2019t be lambasted. \nAnd remember this: So out of the almost $6 million that was raised not one penny did I take for administration cost. That\u2019s unheard of. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nYes, I made a speech and during the speech I said, \u201cLet\u2019s raise a little money for the vets.\u201d It turned out to be a lot of money, not a little money. I thought if we could get to $1 million, it would be great, which it would have been. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \n...But I think the political press...I think the political press \u2013 I see the stories and I see the way they\u2019re attached. \nFor instance, I went down this weekend to do Rolling Thunder. I was invited. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with it. We had a tremendous gathering of people \u2013 thousands \u2013 I don\u2019t know how many thousands \u2013 but many thousands of people. And I joked \u201cOh, I thought we were going to go from the Jefferson Memorial to the \u2013 \u201c I was joking. They said \u201cDonald Trump was disappointed\u201d. Everybody knew I was being sarcastic and joking. They said some of them. Said Donald Trump was very disappointed that it didn\u2019t go from Jefferson to Lincoln. You know, millions of people. \nI was joking. I said \u201cOh, I\u2019m used to watching it. We had \u2013 \u201c I was joking. So they put it down as serious. They know I was joking. \nI\u2019ll give you another example. We had a certain \u2013 same event \u2013 it was roped off where you could only get so many people there and there were a lot of people. I don\u2019t know \u2013 10,000, 15,000, maybe 25,000. I don\u2019t know there was a lot of people. Plus there were people breaking the seams all the way along. \nEugene Washington, a man I like actually, wrote an article said there were 5,000 people there. There were many times that. And you weren\u2019t allowed to have any more people. \nAnd all of these people were with their motorcycles in parking lots all the way. They were waving to me as I\u2019m going. \nSupport for Siouxland Soldiers \u2013 $100,000. \nTask Force Dagger Foundation \u2013 $50,000. \nThe Mission Continues \u2013 $75,000. \nThe National Military Family Association Inc. \u2013 $75,000. \nVeterans Airlift Command \u2013 $100,000. \nVeterans Count \u2013 $25,000. \nVeterans-In-Command Inc. $150,000. \nVietnam Veterans Workshop Inc. \u2013 $75,000. \nWarriors for Freedom Foundation \u2013 $50,000. \nAnd I believe we\u2019re going to have some more coming in. Some friends of mine, some more coming in. And that adds up to $5,600,000 total and we\u2019re going to have some more coming in. \nNow, every one of those checks have been passed other than the one check which is being held subject to they\u2019re getting a final approval from the government. But every one of those has been passed. \nThis is my check for $1 million. \nWe have many letters from the different groups thanking us very much for the money and they didn\u2019t ask \u2013 I didn\u2019t ask people to be here today. I could have asked every one of the group unlike Hillary who asks people to stand outside and say \u201cDonald Trump didn\u2019t give the money.\u201d \nNobody gave this kind of money. \nSo I gave $5,600,000. More is coming in. Probably tops the $6 million number. \nI never thought we were going to raise $1 million when we started. And we end up doing almost $6 million. \nI have to tell you the press is so dishonest and so unfair. \nA lot of the people behind me and some of the people over here helped in vetting the various requests for money. And I just want to thank all of those people.  \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI was going to give it to three companies or three groups and we couldn\u2019t vet them quickly. And so I gave it to the Marine. \nAnd if you look at number, the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation is a fabulous group and I didn\u2019t have to go through a big vetting process with them. Because I was going to split the $1 million check up amongst...and in the end I just didn\u2019t want to go through the process of having to vet all those different groups. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \n...Look, when this started...I said if we could raise $1 million that would be good. And we ended up raising almost $6 million. And I\u2019m going to have more coming in over a period of time. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nActually though what I got was worse than credit because they were questioning me. And this is money. And by the way, most of that money went out very early just so you understand. But a lot of these groups \u2013 getting vetted by, you know, when you pay the money out, they need government documentation. They need a lot of different things. \nJust so you understand. When I didn\u2019t do the Fox debate...because I didn\u2019t think they treated me right but actually they\u2019ve been extremely fair over the last three or four months, I have to say that about Fox. But when I didn\u2019t do that one event, the debate, I gave a speech. I didn\u2019t have to do this with the money for the vets but I decided to because I thought it would be a good idea. \nAnd I had some very generous people \u2013 Carl Icahn gave $500,000. Phil Ruffin gave $1 million...Ike Perlmutter gave $1 million. We raised a lot of money. And I didn\u2019t have to do that. It would have been easier just to give the speech. \nAnd the problem with the press what they do is they convince people like me not to do it, not to give money to different things because it\u2019s a lot easier actually that way. \nArmed Services YMCA of the United States \u2013 $75,000. \nBob Woodruff Family Foundation Inc. \u2013 they do a good job \u2013 $75,000. \nCentral Iowa Shelter and Services \u2013 these are all vet-related \u2013 $100,000. \nConnected Warriors Inc. \u2013 $75,000. \nDisabled American Veterans Charitable Service Trust \u2013 $115,000. \nFisher House Foundation \u2013 great people \u2013 $115,000. \nFolds of Honor Foundation \u2013 $200,000. \nFoundation for American Veterans \u2013 $75,000. \nFreedom Alliance \u2013 $75,000. \nGreen Beret Foundation \u2013 $350,000. \nHire Heroes USA \u2013 $75,000. \nHomes for Our Troops \u2013 $50,000. \nAnd just so you understand, we\u2019ve got a long way to go. This money was raised during a little speech that I made rather than doing a debate. The one debate I missed. It was the lowest rated debate by the way but I won\u2019t say that. \nHonoring America\u2019s Warriors \u2013 $100,000. \nHope for the Warriors \u2013 $65,000. \nIntrepid Fallen Heroes Fund \u2013 $175,000. \nK9s for Warriors \u2013 $50,000. \nLiberty House \u2013 $100,000. \nMarine Corps \u2013 Law Enforcement Foundation \u2013 $1,100,000. I gave $1 million to them. A great group. \nNavy Seal Foundation \u2013 $465,000. \nNavy-Marine Corps Relief Society \u2013 $75,000. \nNew England Wounded Veterans Inc. \u2013 $75,000. \nOperation Homefront \u2013 $65,000. \nPartners for Patriots \u2013 $100,000. \nProject for Patriots \u2013 and we\u2019re still vetting them by the way. The check is ready to go. But they don\u2019t have all of their appropriate \u2013 in fact, we have down here will be released to them upon the receipt of the IRS determination letter. It\u2019s the only one, which we hear they\u2019re fantastic but they have to give us that final document. \nThis is what I mean by vetting. You have to have all the documents. Otherwise you can\u2019t give them the money. \nProject for Patriots \u2013 $100,000. \nPuppy Jake Foundation \u2013 $100,000. \nRacing for Heroes Inc. \u2013 $200,000 \nAnd behalf of the vets, the press should be ashamed of themselves. They are calling me. They are furious because I sent people checks of a lot of money. \nWe\u2019re going to give you the names right now, which is what you want. \nAnd instead of being like \u201cThank you very much, Mr. Trump\u201d or \u201cTrump did a good job\u201d, everyone said, \u201cWho got it? Who got it? Who got it?\u201d And you make me look very bad. \nI have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job. \nSo I will give the names because that\u2019s what you want. Right? \nOkay. Are you ready? \nI brought them here. It takes \u2013 because you have to vet each company. You know, much of this money was paid out fairly early. \nBut you have to vet all of these different groups because these are many different groups. You have to go through a process. When you send checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars to people and to companies and to groups that you\u2019ve never heard of \u2013 charitable organizations. You have to vet it. You send people out. You do a lot of work. \nNow, most of the money went out quite a while ago. Some of it went out more recently. But all of this has gone out and I\u2019ll give you the names. \nAre you ready? Do you have your pad? \nAnd again, I really think the press \u2013 look, the media, you know my opinion of the media. It\u2019s very low. I think the media is frankly made up of people that, in many cases, not in all cases, are not good people. But I think this is an example. \nAnd I just on behalf of all of the folks that have worked hard on this and all of the people that have made contributions, including myself; I gave $1 million, but I just want to tell you that there are so many people that are so thankful for what we did. \nOne other thing that\u2019s important to know. Zero dollars have been taken out for administration. \nYou know, when you go to a lot of these different groups, in this case, zero dollars have been taken out for administration. So a lot of these companies that make a lot of money doing the administration stuff. So no money \u2013 it costs zero dollars to accumulate all of this money. Okay? \nSo you have 22 Kill and that\u2019s $200,000. \nAnd you can call these people. That was another thing. A lot of the money when it was sent out, different people would call. I could tell you, I\u2019m not going to mention anybody specifically, but there were a couple of people that were really disgusting. They\u2019d call and these vet groups they don\u2019t get a lot of calls from the press. And maybe some of them would keep quiet or they didn\u2019t know or they didn\u2019t want to talk to the press or they didn\u2019t feel comfortable. \nSo if they didn\u2019t say they got the money, which they all did, 100% got the money. All certified checks. If anyone wants to see the certified checks. \nBut rather than say why don\u2019t you \u2013 could I see a certified check? They said \u201cWell, they didn\u2019t say they got the money.\u201d They all got the money. \nBut they\u2019re not people that always talk to the press. Many of them do talk to the press. Many of them have \u2013 I guess you found $2 million or $2.5 million where they talked. \nWell, the number is $5.6 million and it\u2019s going to possibly go above that because I believe some other people are coming in. \nReady? \n22Kill got $200,000. \nNow, these are checks that have been delivered, that have been cashed, that are now being used to help the vets. \nAchilles International \u2013 great organization \u2013 $200,000. Much of this money was paid a long time ago. \nAmerican Hero Adventures \u2013 $100,000. \nAmericans for Equal Living \u2013 $100,000. \nAmerica\u2019s Vetdogs \u2013 The Veterans\u2019 K-9 Corps Inc. \u2013 $75,000. \nAMVETS \u2013 $75,000.\n... \nWe\u2019ve gotten the nomination. We\u2019re going to have an incredible period in Cleveland. We look forward to it. \nWe\u2019ve started working already on the convention. \nAnd LeBron, good luck in the series because we\u2019re going to have the series, which of course the longer it goes the less time we have but that\u2019s okay. And it\u2019s going to be very interesting to see what happens. \nBut as you know, they\u2019re playing the basketball championships partially in that arena so I think it will be very exciting. It\u2019ll add to the excitement in Cleveland and that\u2019s good. That\u2019s what we want because it\u2019s going to be an exciting period of time. \nWe have \u2013 we\u2019ve done some awfully good work. I was just informed...that we\u2019ve got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican primaries and we still have I guess six or seven locations to go, states to go. \nAnd in the history, think of it, in the history of this great party, we\u2019ve gotten substantially more votes than anybody else by millions \u2013 by many millions more \u2013 than anybody who\u2019s ever run. \nSo that\u2019s a great. You know, when you think Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan and everybody, we have the most votes by far. So that\u2019s something to me that\u2019s very exciting. \nAnd overall, it\u2019s just been a very exciting process. I think we\u2019re going to do very well. \nWe have no idea what\u2019s going to happen on the Democrat\u2019s side but they\u2019re certainly having difficulty. I don\u2019t like to see people having difficulty. But if anybody has to have it, let it be them. \nAnd I think it\u2019s going to be very interesting. \nI\u2019m very proud to say that we\u2019ve gotten the most votes and also if you look at the overall primary the amount of votes cast, that\u2019s also a record. So we\u2019ve broken a lot of records in terms of the voters. \nOur polling has come out and the polls are doing very well as you know. We\u2019re pretty much even and in some cases ahead of Hillary. And I think we\u2019re going to have a very, very successful number of months. And I think it will all culminate in November and we\u2019re going to make America great. Okay? \nSo that\u2019s the way it is... \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nBut I\u2019ve raised almost $6 million. All of the money has been paid out and I\u2019m going to give it to you in just a second. \nIn fact, I brought a list just in case that question was asked. \nBut the money has been paid out. \nI have been thanked by so many veterans\u2019 groups throughout the United States. \nOne gentleman called me up recently crying that out of a blue he got a check for $100,000. I have been thanked by so many groups \u2013 great veterans\u2019 groups. \nAnd by the way, outside you have a few people picketing. They\u2019re sent there by Hillary Clinton and they\u2019re picketing that the money wasn\u2019t sent. The money has all been sent. \nI wanted to keep it private. If we could, I wanted to keep it private because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anybody\u2019s business if I want to send money to the vets. \nBut I have to say this. I raised close to $6 million. It\u2019ll probably be over that amount when it\u2019s all said and done. But as of this moment, it\u2019s $5.6 million. \nWhen this started, it started with a speech in Iowa when I said let\u2019s raise some money for the vets and it went up from $1 million to $2 million to $3 million. And it now ends up to be almost $6 million and again I think we can even do better than that. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech to African-American voters in Cleveland", "text": "Just today in the Wall Street Journal \u2013 they have an amazing story about \u2013 amazing Wall Street Journal story today \u2013 about all of the support that we\u2019re getting, and from lots of rich people even. They\u2019re coming in. \nYou know, these were \u201cnever Trump, never Trump, never Trump\u201d, and now, they\u2019re believing. \nThey see lower taxes. They see cutting the regulations. They see job-creation, which is so important. And it\u2019s really been amazing. \nAnd one of the things that they see, and that you people see, is that it\u2019s so important \u2013 the judges. \nSo, I picked 11 judges very much into the world of the Constitution. Because we have \u2013 we have people that in some cases \u2013 I think in all cases \u2013 that will, the Constitution will have no bearing on their decisions, okay, if somebody else gets it. \nAnd we picked 11, and we\u2019re adding 9 more. We\u2019re going to have a total of 20 people, and I will pick from that group of 20 people. These are 20 outstanding people. \nThe rest of them \u2013 already 11 have been named, we\u2019re adding nine more who are terrific. Very much Federalist Society choices, Heritage and Federalists. And they\u2019re really, really amazing judges. \nAnd I will pick from that group. \nAnd these judges- you know we lost Judge Scalia- and these judges are very much the mold of Judge Scalia. \nSo, I think it\u2019s very important \u2013 so important. So important. \nThis election, those people and those Republicans that aren\u2019t helping \u2013 they should be ashamed of themselves. They should be ashamed of themselves. \nQuestion:\n[Omitted]\n \nAnd, I\u2019ve already gotten the endorsement from so many different groups. And, they\u2019re great people, great people. \nNow, great people \u2013 you always have problems. You have somebody in there that either makes a mistake, that\u2019s bad, or that chokes. \nI must tell you. I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa. And that man was hands up. That man went to the car hands up, put his hands on the car. And to me, it looked like he did everything you\u2019re supposed to do. \nAnd he looked like a really good man, and maybe I\u2019m a little clouded because I saw his family talking about him after the fact. So, you get a little bit different image, maybe, but to me he looked like, you know, somebody who was doing what they were asking him to do. \nAnd, this young officer \u2013 I don\u2019t know what she was thinking. I don\u2019t know what she was thinking, but I\u2019m very, very troubled by that. I\u2019m very, very troubled by that. \nAnd, we have to very \u2013 we have to be very careful. \nSo, I mean, these things are terrible. In my opinion that was a terrible \u2013 a terrible situation. \nAnd, we\u2019ve seen others, we\u2019ve seen others. And, the police are aware of that, too. \nBy the way, the police are troubled by it, too. They look at it...Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? \nBut, maybe people like that, people that choke, maybe they can\u2019t be doing what they\u2019re doing. Okay? They can\u2019t be doing stuff like that. \nSo, we all respect our police greatly, and they will just have to get better and better and better. \nThank you. \nQuestion:\n[Omitted]\n \nYou\u2019ve been trying and working in the inner cities with the Democrats for so many years. Sometimes over a hundred years. There are actually communities so and they\u2019re a disaster. The schools, the safety, the jobs, it\u2019s all horrible. \nI mean, in some cases they\u2019re less safe than places like Afghanistan. You know, we hear about Afghanistan. Some of the inner cities are less safe. \nSo, I just tell you this. We are going to make such headway, such a change, and you know they\u2019re not gonna to do it. Because Darrell, they have been doing it for 50, 60 \u2013 some were I mean minimum was like 32 I think. There\u2019s one said 32. Unbroken. Unbroken. \nAnd I I say that and some people I told you before some people love it and some people don\u2019t like it that much. What do you have to lose? Can\u2019t get any worse. It really can\u2019t. The inner cities cannot get much worse. Perhaps they can, but not much. And I will fix it. \nWhat do you have to lose? I will fix it. So we\u2019re going to change it. \nQuestion:\n[Omitted]\n \nNAFTA is destroyed country. It\u2019s destroyed our manufacturing. Our manufacturing has gone to Mexico and all these other countries. \nAnd we\u2019re gonna renegotiate those deals and we\u2019re gonna make \u2018em either very good and very fair or we\u2019re going to terminate \u2018em. We\u2019ll start all over again. Believe me. We\u2019re gonna bring our jobs back. We\u2019re gonna bring our companies back that have left us, fired all their employees. We\u2019re gonna bring \u2018em back. \nSo that will be the thing maybe I originally started on that and illegal immigration. And we have to stop the illegal immigration by the way. We have to stop illegal immigration. \nAnd Hillary Clinton is not in any way, shape, or form capable of doing that. \nQuestion:\n[Omitted]\n \nAnd the involvement that you have, which is a Common Core involvement, the involvement that you have is not a good involvement. \nWe\u2019re gonna be very much involved with the inner cities and we\u2019re gonna create incentives for the inner cities so that the inner cities can grow and produce jobs. \nAnd we\u2019re gonna bring our jobs back from all these countries that have stolen \u2018em like we\u2019re a bunch of babies. It\u2019s like candy being taken away from a baby. That\u2019s the way they took it. And we\u2019re not gonna let that happen anymore. \nMany of you folks have had great jobs that you don\u2019t have anymore your company is gone. And you\u2019ve never been able to replace that great job you had when you were younger. \nAnd we are going to bring our companies back and we\u2019re gonna bring our jobs back believe me. \nIt is to a large extent about jobs. \nQuestion:\n[Omitted]\n \nYou know that question and that response is amazing because I get it in so many places and you\u2019ll hear about these never-Trumpers, who are dying. Right now they\u2019re on a respirator, okay? \nI know the hardships this inflicts, and I\u2019m determined to do something about it. \nPlease know this: For any who are hurting, things are going to turn and turn for the better. \nWe are going to win again as a country, and we are going to win again for all of our people, not just certain segments of our people, for all of our people. \nI want to work with you to renew the bonds of trust between citizens and the bonds of faith that make our nation strong. \nAmerica\u2019s been lifted out of many of its most difficult hours through the miracle of faith. And you people understand that very well. Everybody in this room understands, which is one of the reasons you\u2019re here. \nNow in these hard times, for our country, let us turn again to our Christian heritage to lift up the soul of our nation. \nI am so deeply grateful to be here today, and it\u2019s my prayer that America and the America of tomorrow will be one of unity, togetherness, peace and love. We can do that. \nI\u2019d like to conclude with a passage from 1st John Chapter 4: \u201cNo one has ever seen God. But if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.\u201d So true. \nSo pastor, I want to thank you. I want thank the congregation. This has been a really great honor for me and we have some interesting days ahead. \nWe will have a little debate on Monday night. A couple of you might be watching it. Anybody going to watch it? \nAnd we have a very big election coming up on Nov. 8th, so hopefully you\u2019ll get out and vote. \nBut again, to the African-American community, to the Hispanic community, to all communities I wanted to just say we\u2019re going to make it right. We\u2019re going to make it great. \nThank you. Thank you, all. Thank you, all. \nQuestion:\n[Omitted]\n \nAnd we\u2019re going to have great education in our country. We don\u2019t have it now. But choice  very important. Very, very important. \nAnd Common Core has to be ended. We\u2019re bringing education local, meaning our loving parents and all of the professionals, we\u2019re going to do it on a local basis not with the bureaucrats. \nQuestion:\n[Omitted]\n \nAnd you have everybody in this room. You have Asian. You have white. You have black. You have everybody right here. And you see what\u2019s happening. \nSo the churches are so important and all of our religious institutions. \nAnd the other thing, we have to stop the drugs from pouring in from across the border. \nWe have a tremendous drug problem in Cleveland, in Ohio, in North Carolina, in South Carolina, and in New Hampshire. There\u2019s a tremendous problem. Heroin. Particular in New Hampshire. \nBut we are \u2013 our country\u2019s being poisoned and it\u2019s pouring in across the southern border. And we are going to stop it, believe me. \nYou know the border patrol agents are great. 16,500 they endorse us recently. They endorsed Trump. First time they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. \nWe are going to stop the drugs from poisoning our youth from poisoning our country. It\u2019s just poisoning our youth. \nBut today I just want to let you know that I am here to listen. To you, I\u2019m going to listen, and I\u2019m always going to listen. \nIt\u2019s a promise that I make. I\u2019m running to be President for all Americans \u2013 every single one. \nOur nation is too divided. \nWe talk past each other constantly, not to each other. \nAnd to those who seek office, we do not do enough to step in to the community and learn what is happening and what is going on. They don\u2019t do it. Again, they want your vote and they\u2019re gone. \nI\u2019m here today to learn so that we can together remedy injustice in all of its many very unattractive forms. \nOur political system has failed the people and works only to enrich itself. I want to reform that system so that it works for you, all of you. \nI believe true reform can only come from outside the system, from outside the establishment. \nBecoming the nominee of the party of Abraham Lincoln has been the greatest honor of my life. It\u2019s on his legacy that I hope to build the future of our party. \nI believe we need a civil rights agenda for our time, one that insures the right to a good education and the right to live in safety and in peace. \nIt also means the right, so true, so, so unsafe. When you see people being shot in the streets walking to a store with their child, often times, their child being shot for no reason whatsoever, so sad. \nIt also means the right to have a government that protects our workers and fights for our jobs. \nI want to rebuild our country and I want to rebuild our inner cities, it\u2019s time, it\u2019s time. \nIt breaks my heart to see any American left behind or to see a city like Cleveland that has had so many struggles. \nNothing is more sad than when we sideline young Americans with unfulfilled potential. \nYou look at somebody like Don King where he\u2019s become so successful. He just broke that system. He wouldn\u2019t take no. I mean he\u2019s an amazing inspiration to so many people, including me. \nOur whole country loses out. We\u2019re one nation, and when any one hurts, we all hurt together. That\u2019s the way it is. That\u2019s the way it should be too. \nWe are all brothers and sisters, and we\u2019re all created, all everyone, created by the same God. \nWe must love each other and support each other, and we\u2019re all in this together. \nI fully understand that the African-American community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right. \nI want to make America prosperous for everyone. I want to make this city the economic envy of the world, here in Detroit and Baltimore and there\u2019s so many places. \nWe have so much work to do. Factories everywhere, new roads, new bridges, new schools, new hope. We\u2019re going to bring our jobs back. Our jobs have been taken away by inept politicians that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. Our companies have left and gone to Mexico and other places. \nWe\u2019re going to bring our jobs back. Believe me. And it\u2019s not even going to be hard. \nI have been so greatly blessed in so many ways with no greater blessing than my family. I have a wonderful family. \nNothing would make me happier than to use what I have learned in business and in traveling the world \u2013 I have been all over \u2013 to bring wealth and prosperity and opportunity to those who have not had these opportunities before. \nWhen I see wages falling \u2013 and falling big league \u2013 people were making more money 18 years ago in many cases than they\u2019re making today and today they\u2019re working harder. They have two jobs. It\u2019s not supposed to be that way. \n...I\u2019ll read it out for you but I feel very strongly about it. So much can be done and it\u2019s not being done. \nThey come and they take your vote and then they say we\u2019ll see you in four years. Thanks a lot. We\u2019ll see you in 4 years. \nAnd we\u2019re going to do it differently. \nFor centuries, the African-American church has been the conscience of our country. \nIt\u2019s from the pews, pulpits, and Christian teaching of black churches all across the land that the civil rights movements lifted up the soul of our nation. \nIt\u2019s from these pews that our nation has been inspired toward a better moral character, a deeper concern for mankind, and a spirit of charity and unity that binds us all together. \nThe African-American faith community has been one of God\u2019s greatest gifts to America and to the American people. \nThere\u2019s perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal \u2013 and I mean heal \u2013 our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform, stronger, greater to the black churches and church goers. \nI was in Detroit recently with Bishop Jackson, who is an incredible also, and it was incredible what I saw. The love in that room and I\u2019m not saying the love for me. I\u2019m just saying the love in that room for everybody. And the spirit. Even the song. His wife is a beautiful singer... It was just amazing. I didn\u2019t want to leave. \nSo it\u2019s great. \nYou do right every day by your community and your family. \nYou raise children in the light of God. I will always support your church and defend your right to worship always. I will always be there. \nI am here today to listen to your message and I hope my presence here will help and very much help your voice to reach new audiences. It\u2019s going to happen in our country. \nAnd these are people \u2013 believe me, there are many people out there that desperately need it. \nChurch faith is not the past but the present and the future. It is the foundation of progress. \nAnd I pledge to you that if I win. Some people say why if and when. Let\u2019s say if because we have to be realistic. It\u2019s a close race. But if you all go out and vote, we\u2019re going to win. \nBut I pledge to you we\u2019re going to end the Johnson amendment, which takes away the voice of your pastors, your minister, your great leaders. It takes away their voice. We\u2019re going to end quickly \u2013 quickly \u2013 the Johnson amendment. \nSo important. It\u2019s taking away your voice. \nPassed in 1954 by a very powerful man, Lyndon Johnson, because he didn\u2019t get along with a certain church, they say, in Houston. Because the pastor was maybe against him, maybe not with him, maybe something was going on. \nShows you the power of Lyndon Johnson. All respect. You have to respect it.  But he had this past that takes away your leaders and your people that you must respect. People like pastor Darrell Scott. He\u2019s not allowed to talk politics. If he does, they take away his tax exemption. \n So what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re silencing your leaders. They\u2019re silencing the people that you want to hear. \nIt\u2019s not fair because they\u2019re the people I want to hear also. \nSo we\u2019re going to get rid of the Johnson. \nAs I campaign all across this nation...I will have an opportunity to lay out my plans for economic change. \nI will have a chance to discuss school choice, which is so important, and how to put every American on the ladder to success, meaning a great education and a great job. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at the Republican Jewish Coalition", "text": "Question on Hillary Clinton: \nI mean, Bernie Sanders has brought her to positions that she didn\u2019t want to be at. You look at some of the things that she\u2019s saying right now. \nBut I\u2019ll tell you what, whether she is or not, she doesn\u2019t have the strength or the energy to help Israel. I\u2019m telling you she doesn\u2019t. \n...But just take a look. She\u2019ll come out and do an event and you don\u2019t see her for another four days, three days, five days. No, it\u2019s true. \nThink of it. We don\u2019t need \u2013 some people say it\u2019s not nice to say. She doesn\u2019t have the strength or the energy. \nIsrael needs more than just our support. They need strength. They need real power behind them. \nBecause you know, you look at as these countries fall over there, Israel\u2019s looking more and more \u2013 you know, Israel has some difficulties. \nAnd one thing and I think you\u2019ll all admit it. These people are fighting really dirty but they fight a lot better than we used to think. Right? We used to think \u201cOh, that was easy.\u201d \n15 years ago with my friends from Israel because I have a lot of friends from Israel, they used to smile and laugh \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Now they\u2019re saying, \u201cThese guys are \u2013 they\u2019re dirty fighters.\u201d And they\u2019re not bad. You know, they\u2019re tough. They\u2019re not the JV. Okay? Obama said they\u2019re the JV. They\u2019re not the JV folks. \nWe need tough. We need General George Patton. We need General MacArthur. We don\u2019t need the guys we have. I see them on television \u2013 generals. I don\u2019t want my generals on television saying \u201cWell, ISIS is very tough.\u201d \nI saw a guy the other day. ISIS is very tough. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t need that. \nDo you think General George Patton \u2013 they don\u2019t like him because he was a foul mouth vicious horrible brilliant guy. So he would never make it. They probably would have had him thrown out years ago. \nBut we need Patton. We need a genius like MacArthur. \nAnd we have those people. We have those people. I\u2019ll find that person. \nBut we\u2019re going to knock the crap out of them, I\u2019ll tell you what. We\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win. \nQuestion on the greatest challenges facing the U.S.: \nBut radical Islam is \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you one thing I know isn\u2019t is global warming. That\u2019s the one thing...I know isn\u2019t. \nI mean, we have a guy that just the other day who said \u2013 here they want to blow everything \u2013 this is right after Paris. They want to blow our cities up. They want to destroy our civilization, and he\u2019s worried about global warming, which a lot of people think is a hoax. \nBy the way, I won so many environmental awards shockingly. No, it\u2019s true. \nAnd you know what I want to do? I want really immaculate air. I want clean, crystal water. I want a lot of things. Okay? I want a lot of things. \nBut global warming \u2013 you noticed they changed the name \u2013 they go global warming, they go climate change, they go \u2013 now I hear a lot of extreme weather. How can you miss with extreme weather, right? If it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s okay. If it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s okay. If it\u2019s windy, if it\u2019s hot \u2013 everything is extreme. So now they use extreme weather. It is a disgrace what\u2019s going on. \nAnd to have this man embarrass us by standing up and saying that global warming is our biggest threat, we got to get him out so fast and thank goodness we only have a year left. \nThank you. Thank you very much everybody. \nQuestion on whether Jerusalem should be the undivided capital of Israel: \nDo me a favor. Just relax. Okay? You\u2019ll like me very much, believe me. Okay? And you wonder why you get yourself in trouble. All right? You\u2019re going to like me very much. It\u2019s going to be fine. \nBut again, you can\u2019t go in with that \u2013 if you\u2019re going to make a deal and you could make a great deal \u2013 you can\u2019t go in with the attitude we\u2019re going to shove it down. You\u2019ve got to go in and get it and do it and do it nicely so everyone\u2019s happy. Don\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019re going to be very happy. Okay? Don\u2019t worry about it. \nQuestion on Netanyahu: \nAnd \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ll talk about deals after the fact, which is a shame but I think the Iran deal is the worst single thing. \nPerhaps it\u2019ll go down \u2013 and I\u2019ve been pretty good at predicting things. I think it\u2019s going to go down as the worst single thing that\u2019s ever happened to Israel. I think it\u2019s a catastrophe for Israel. \nAnd I think the fact that Obama was willing to make that deal for anybody that loves Israel to support this guy or even the Democratic Party is impossible to believe. \nI think it will be one of the great catastrophes. \nBut if I get in, I will straighten it out, believe me. It\u2019s going to be straightened out. It\u2019s going to be straightened out tough and it\u2019s going to be straightened out fast. \nThe one bad thing is if I get in, the $150 billion is gone. That hurts me and that hurts the people of Israel. But the $150 billion is gone because it\u2019ll be gone before you get there. \nYou know, we\u2019re talking about a year and more actually. Although the election very quick. You know, it\u2019s coming up. It\u2019s now less than a year and you know we have the Iowa starts on February 1st and then we go right down the line and it\u2019s very exciting. We\u2019re talking about a couple of months now for it to start. \nFor a person like me, I mean, it\u2019s very exciting. \nQuestion on which Arab leaders with whom Trump can work: \nYou know, I told you I made commercials for Bibi. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to help me in the negotiation. I can tell you. You know, I\u2019m trying to keep it nice and level, right? Then I get people screaming at me. But I\u2019m trying to keep it as level as possible but I for the most part don\u2019t know. \nThe King of Jordan seems like a nice man. I mean, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re going to see. A lot of people like him; some people don\u2019t. \nBut I think I will probably be able \u2013 what my history \u2013 you know, I took some heat because I get along with Democrats, I get along with liberals, I get along with conservatives, I get along with Republicans. I get along with everybody. That\u2019s what I was \u2013 I\u2019m a businessperson. I get along with everybody. We have to get along with everybody. \nAnd I took some heat and I always explained that. I said, \u201cWait a minute, I\u2019m a businessperson. I\u2019ve got to get along with everybody.\u201d I live in Manhattan. It\u2019s all Democrat. I mean, it\u2019s virtually all \u2013 Republicans don\u2019t even run people for the most part and if they do they get 5%. You know, they get a very small percentage of the vote. Got to get along with everybody. \nI think that\u2019s going to be a tremendous asset because right now we have gridlock in Washington. We have people that \u2013 they don\u2019t talk. \nYou know, I remember that years ago because I\u2019ve been a very political person on the other side but always very political. \nBut years ago, the Republicans and the Democrats \u2013 they used to like each other. They\u2019d get along. They\u2019d have dinner together. They\u2019d argue and they\u2019d fight and they\u2019d disagree and would have, you know, different views and things. \nBut in the evening, they\u2019d go out and they\u2019d have dinner together with their families. You don\u2019t see that anymore. \nThere\u2019s total hatred and there\u2019s total gridlock. \nI\u2019ll give you one point, which I think is important. Corporate inversions. Right? So you have companies leaving the United States and they\u2019re leaving because of better taxes and better a lot of things. A lot of things are better. But they\u2019re leaving. Pfizer. How good is Pfizer? Thousands and thousands of jobs are going to be lost. \nBut they\u2019re also leaving because we have $2.5 trillion at least \u2013 I think it\u2019s a much higher number than that. $2.5 trillion \u2013 that\u2019s out of the country that these companies can\u2019t get back because of bureaucracy and horrible trade agreements but because the taxes are too high. They\u2019re so onerous that nobody in this room would agree to pay that much money to get your money out. \nSo they leave it over there and they actually take the company and they move the company to the money because that\u2019s how much money. \nThe Republicans and the Democrats totally agree that the money should come back. For three years they can\u2019t get a deal. There\u2019s no leadership. It\u2019s gridlock. \nThere\u2019s an example of something where everybody agrees \u2013 all the people that you see up here they all agree but they can\u2019t get it done because they\u2019re politicians. They\u2019re all talk; they\u2019re no action. \nSo there\u2019s something and it\u2019s so important. It\u2019s not like something where they don\u2019t get \u2013 like there\u2019s big disputes and we understand that. This is something everybody agrees \u2013 the money should pour into this country and we should use the money and all the things \u2013 taxes paid. \nBut they agree and they can\u2019t get it doen because of gridlock and incompetent leadership. \nQuestion on the new hotel Trump is constructing: \nBut to show you how important this forum is and how important the country is to me and how important Israel is to me, it\u2019s so important, I don\u2019t mention my projects. It\u2019s not like very important to me anymore. \nWhat\u2019s really important to me is the United States and making it great again. \nMy theme is Make America Great Again. I mean, it\u2019s taken off like crazy. The hats \u2013 it\u2019s going crazy. \nBut you know, some of these guys try to copy it but I had it trademarked because we\u2019re smart. \nA couple of them got up. No, you see, I was making this speech and everybody stood up \u2013 make America great again... But nobody stood up to them. But we sent them a little notice \u2013 don\u2019t use that term. We\u2019re trademarked. \nCan you imagine I got the approval? \nBut we are \u2013 we\u2019re building a great hotel down the road. I hope you all stay and it\u2019s going to be wonderful... \nQuestion on Trump\u2019s view on Israel\u2019s commitment to peace: \nAnd one of the questions was about Israel and the Palestinians what\u2019s going to happen. \nI said \u2013 I used that as an example of some deals that are maybe the hardest deal ever in history to make...Can we think of any deals? We all have tough deals, right? You know, we have some good, some bad... \nBut I said people are going to have to make sacrifices one way or the other. \nI believe \u2013 because I\u2019m a dealmaker \u2013 I believe that I can put both sides together. \nBut I said, it\u2019ll take six months. At the end of six months and maybe sooner \u2013 with us we have a deal instinct. A lot of us. And you can walk into a room and you can almost tell like in two seconds whether or not you\u2019re going to make a deal. \nI will know very quickly whether or not I\u2019ll be able to put that deal together. \nI used that in this interview as an example of perhaps the hardest deal in history to put together. There\u2019s probably no tougher deal. \nIf I could do that, it would make me so happy because there\u2019s so much violence, so much death, and just been going on for so many years. \nNow, I said you have to have a commitment to make it. I don\u2019t know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I don\u2019t know that the other side has the commitment to make it. \nWith that being said, you know, I have a good chance of winning because you look at what\u2019s going on. So I have a good chance. I don\u2019t like to as a dealmaker give away a lot of cards by talking about how I feel about this or that. I\u2019d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room. I don\u2019t want one side or the other saying. \nLook, I think people know where I stand. But wouldn\u2019t it be great if they could make a deal? But a lasting deal, a real deal. Not a phony deal that\u2019s going to last a week and then bad things started happening again. \nI\u2019d love to \u2013 and I will give it. You know Obama, as you know he said it won\u2019t happen, meaning he gave up on this before it even started. \nBut I think it would be a great thing for Israel \u2013 I think it would be a great actually for both sides if a real deal could be made, and I\u2019m going to give it my best. \nI\u2019m a great dealmaker. That\u2019s what I do. I made a lot of money. I\u2019m going to give it my best. It would be great if that deal could be made. \nBy the way, Israel has given a lot...And a lot of people don\u2019t know that. I think the public relations for Israel hasn\u2019t been so great because Israel\u2019s given a lot but hasn\u2019t been given a lot of credit for what they\u2019ve given... \nIn fact, some things have been given which were unthinkable and a lot of turmoil it caused in Israel. There were things given. But I\u2019d like to go in with a clean slate and just say let\u2019s go, everybody\u2019s even, we love everybody, and let\u2019s see if we could do something. \nBut I do think this \u2013 and I do think right from the beginning and that one of the reasons I\u2019m saying it now even though perhaps it comes back to haunt me later on it has to be said that Israel has given a lot. I don\u2019t know whether or not they want to go that far in a little step and you know that\u2019s going to be up to them. But Israel has not been given the credit that they deserve for what they\u2019ve done. I will say that. I will say that. So that\u2019s it. \nBut the fact is I want to renegotiate that deal. I want to drop him right smack in the middle of where he came from. The hell \u2013 they can have him even if we don\u2019t get the five guys back because that\u2019s not going to happen because you know where they are right now? They\u2019re right now all in the battlefield fighting us and trying to kill us and kill anybody that gets in. \nSo they get their five guys that they\u2019ve wanted for nine years they\u2019ve wanted them and we get a dirty rotten traitor. But that\u2019s the way our people negotiate. They\u2019re stupid people. Okay? They\u2019re stupid people. \nIt\u2019s very sad. It\u2019s very sad. \nSo I\u2019ll just tell you that I\u2019m going to win. I am. I\u2019m going to win. I mean, unless something happens, you know, walk across the street, the wrong thing happens. But I\u2019ll tell you what, I have a great secret service. Here\u2019s a nice one, you\u2019re number one, they give you a secret service. I never saw so many people \u2013 talented people, great people. \nBut I believe I\u2019m going to win. I really have just a great feeling about it. And you know, my life has been about winning. I\u2019ve won, and my life has been about winning, and that\u2019s what I want to do for the country. \nAnd if people say about my company and deals and you can do this deal or that deal, I have no interest. \nIt\u2019s like the other day \u2013 Ivanka, she\u2019s doing so great. \u201cDad, we can buy this wonderful office building and I said, \u201cHoney, who cares? How can you talk to me about such trivial things, Ivanka?\u201d It\u2019s amazing. See? Now I\u2019m dealing in trillions. I\u2019ve never heard of trillions before. You know, with this \u2013 we owe $19 trillion. \nWe just signed a budget that\u2019s so bad and the Republicans \u2013 you know, we know where the Democrats are coming from. But these Republican politicians, they go to Washington and they\u2019re going to end Obamacare, which I\u2019m going to do by the way \u2013 I\u2019m ending, I\u2019m terminating, it\u2019s going to be repealed and replaced with something much better. But they go to Washington and they\u2019re going to do this and they\u2019re going to do budgets \u2013 like I heard the guy before \u201cWe\u2019re going to work in the budget.\u201d It\u2019s all about that. What happens is they\u2019re going to do budgets like we\u2019re going to do this and that and I tell this story \u2013 then they walk into the Capitol Building, which is magnificent, and they look up \u201cDarling, oh my, look at those columns, look at the ceiling, look at the angels. Oh, look at these magnificent floors.\u201d They\u2019ve never seen anything like it. \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived. This is incredible.\u201d And then they become mainstream. \u201cWe\u2019ll vote on Obamacare. Yes, I vote.\u201d They don\u2019t want to leave. They lose all of their courage. I want to use a nice word because otherwise they\u2019d get reported for foul language. They lose all of their courage and they\u2019ve let us down. That won\u2019t happen with me. \nSo, again, you\u2019re not going to support me even though you know I\u2019m the best thing that could ever happen to Israel and I\u2019ll be that. I know why you\u2019re not going to support me and you know you\u2019re not going to support me because I don\u2019t want your money. Isn\u2019t it crazy? No, it\u2019s true. \nYou know, if I wanted to have your money, I think I\u2019d have a damn good chance and I think I\u2019d get more money than anybody else. \nDo you know the money I have turned down? This has not been my life turning down money. Guys want to give me millions. \nI would have made \u2013 poor Jeb Bush, I mean, this poor guy with his low energy. It\u2019s sad. No, it\u2019s sad. \nI came up with that term, it became so defining. It\u2019s like having it on his forehead \u201cI am low energy\u201d. No, no, it\u2019s sad. \nHe raised $125 million, which means he\u2019s controlled totally, totally controlled by the people that gave him the money. \nThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t want to give me money, okay? But that\u2019s okay. You want to control your own politician. That\u2019s fine. Good. Fine. Think about that, folks. Don\u2019t worry about it. \nI understand. Hey, five months ago, I was with you. Who\u2019s better than me? Who is better than me? I gave $350,000 to the Republican Governors Association. I never even gotten a letter of thank you. It\u2019s true. $350,000. I didn\u2019t receive one letter, not one letter from one governor. Stupid. The good thing is I don\u2019t give any \u2013 why would I give any more? You don\u2019t get a thank you letter. \nPoliticians \u2013 remember this \u2013 politicians forget, politicians generally aren\u2019t competent, and the one thing they are good at is getting elected and that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to end up having. \nBut I would love your support but I don\u2019t want your money. I appreciate it. Now, let\u2019s take some questions. Okay? Good. \nShe was a horrible Secretary of State. She did a horrible job other than traveled a lot. She traveled a lot, nothing ever got done. The whole \u2013 the world blew up around her. It blew up. \n500 to 600 calls and emails and everything from our ambassador asking for help and she didn\u2019t respond. \nThe truth is she doesn\u2019t have the strength or the energy. She responded to her friends. You know the friends we\u2019re talking about. Some of those friends are, you know, sort of an interesting friend going on there. \nBut she responded \u2013 yeah, you get that, right? A lot of people don\u2019t get that. \nBut she responded to a friend, but she doesn\u2019t respond to an ambassador that\u2019s asking for help. Hundreds \u2013 hundreds of requests and she doesn\u2019t respond. \nNow, remember this, I go every night to someplace. I mean, yesterday I was in Manassas, Virginia, we had an unbelievable crowd. \nThe other day I was in Florida, we had 12,000 people in Sarasota at 12 p.m. with the football games going on. 12,000 people. The convention center held 5,000. So we had thousands outside. I made a speech outside. I made two speeches...I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t get me a larger convention center so I can do one speech?\u201d My people said, \u201cNo, this is the biggest one. We set a record \u2013 a big record. We set a record everywhere. We beat the record of Elton John. It\u2019s true. Elton John. I\u2019m no longer competing with politicians. I\u2019m competing with the musical talent. \nOne of the great musicians said \u201cYou get the largest crowds of any single human being on Earth without a guitar\u201d meaning who doesn\u2019t count on music. \nSo it\u2019s true, we\u2019ve had tremendous response. We\u2019ve had incredible response. \nI think you know if you look at what\u2019s going on and I think based on the response, based on the polls \u2013 again I don\u2019t want your money therefore you\u2019re probably not going to support me because stupidly you want to give money. Trump doesn\u2019t want money therefore we can\u2019t \u2013 even though he\u2019s better than all these guys, even though he\u2019s going to do more for Israel than anybody else, even though Bibi Netanyahu asked me to do a commercial for him and I did and he won his race, so I was very happy about that. But he asked me to do a commercial. And they said I was the only celebrity. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s \u2013 but they said I\u2019m the only celebrity. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a celebrity. See now I\u2019m a politician. I\u2019m so embarrassed by that term. \nYou know, my how life I\u2019ve been a business, I\u2019ve been a developer. I\u2019ve employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. I have unbelievable statements and unbelievable company. \nA lot of people said, \u201cOh, he\u2019ll never file.\u201d This you\u2019ll get a kick out of. \u201cHe\u2019ll never run because he\u2019ll never want to file various papers. And then he\u2019ll never file this and that and then you\u2019d have to sign your life away.\u201d The first paper \u2013 we all know about first papers. You sign your life away. That\u2019s the end of it. He did it. \nThen they said, \u201cWell, he\u2019ll never sign and he\u2019ll never file his financials because who knows, maybe he\u2019s not as rich as people think.\u201d \nSo I filed my financials \u2013 almost 100 pages. The biggest ever filed by the federal elections. And everybody said, \u201cOh my, it\u2019s much bigger and much stronger and holy mackeral, look at these numbers!\u201d \n...If I didn\u2019t run, I\u2019d probably would have filed anyways because you know I built a great company and I like to brag about it whenever possible. It\u2019s true. \nSome of the greatest assets \u2013 Doral, you know, Doral and Turnberry in Scotland and Trump Tower and many buildings in Manhattan. Just many \u2013 Bank of America building in San Francisco with a great partner and so many other buildings and things... \nAnd the reason I bring that up is because that\u2019s the kind of thinking we need. \nAnd I don\u2019t bring it up as braggadocio. I bring it up because that\u2019s the kind of thinking we need in this country to bring us back. We have people that don\u2019t know the first thing about the word negotiation. \nI can take anybody in this office, believe me, and they\u2019re better than Obama and they\u2019re better than Kerry and they\u2019re better than the foolish people \u2013 the foolish people. It\u2019s so embarrassing when you see what happens. \nSergeant Bergdahl, all right? Sergeant Bergdahl \u2013 we get a traitor; they get five of the greatest killers that they\u2019ve wanted for nine years. You know, the deal was five for one. \nAnd they knew he was a traitor before we made the deal. You know about Sergeant Bergdahl. He deserted. Six people were killed trying to get him back. They were looking for him. \nThe general and the colonel went to see all those people, they said, \u201cNo, he deserted. He was a traitor.\u201d And we still made the deal. \nSo we get a traitor. We can give him back. Do you want to re-negotiate deals? Some of us will re-negotiate deals. I would say about 99.9 \u2013 is there anybody that doesn\u2019t re-negotiate deals in this room? This room negotiates so I want to re-negotiate \u2013 perhaps more than any room than I\u2019ve ever spoken. Maybe more. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve been called on that a couple of times too. \nWe\u2019re going to let them self-inspect. And then you have of course the 24 days and the 24 days we\u2019re all good with contracts don\u2019t start until such and such happens. It could be forever before you ever go into inspect. \nAnd we don\u2019t even get our prisoners back. \nAnd now they want to start a negotiation to get the prisoners back and they want 19 people for our three. They don\u2019t want to give us our four. You know we have four. But they only want to talk three. \nNow, that should have been negotiated right at the beginning, three years ago. \nAnd maybe better than any audience, I mean, the people in this room understand what I\u2019m saying. It should have been you walk in \u2013 by the way, did you ever see a negotiation take so long? And we conceded on every single. We didn\u2019t win anything. We didn\u2019t win anything. \nBut that should have been with our prisoners \u2013 day one, whatever it is years ago, we have to get our prisoners back. You don\u2019t want them. We need them. It will make us look better. Both everybody is going to like us more. With the American public, any deal that we strike, it\u2019s going to look good. \nAnd you say that. We have to get our prisoners back. Day one. They\u2019re going to say, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not giving.\u201d And we\u2019re going to say, \u201cBye bye. Bye! Call us when you\u2019re ready.\u201d And then we go out and double up and triple up the sanctions. I guarantee you within 48 hours they\u2019re calling, begging us to come back to the table and you have your prisoners back. It\u2019s so easy. \nNow, the president, you saw that, and John Kerry, who is probably the worst negotiator I\u2019ve ever seen. No, he\u2019s the worst negotiator I\u2019ve ever seen. He did not read The Art of the Deal, folks, I can tell you that. Now, he\u2019s one of the few. He\u2019s one of the \u2013 biggest selling of all time business book of all time, he didn\u2019t read it. And Obama definitely didn\u2019t read it. Obama, ayeyeye. Oh. \nBut they said \u2013 this is hard to believe but this is what they said \u2013 a lot of press back there so I have to say everything exactly correct because if I don\u2019t I end up with a \u2013 they said we didn\u2019t want to complicate the negotiations by asking for the prisoners. It\u2019s really complicated. We want our prisoners back. Oh, so complicated. They said they didn\u2019t want to complicate \u2013 so now, we\u2019re going to end up making a new deal probably at some point. \nI\u2019d tell you this, look I\u2019ll just tell you this: If I win, before I take office, I guarantee you those prisoners are going to be back. They\u2019re going to be back, I guarantee you. They\u2019re going to be back. \nNow, our president doesn\u2019t want to use the term \u2013 we had another event, which probably was \u2013 the one yesterday \u2013 probably was related. It always happens but it probably was. When I heard about it, I figured maybe not. But it turns out probably was related \u2013 radical Islamic terrorism. And I\u2019ll tell you what, we have a president that refuses to use the term. He refuses to say. There\u2019s something going on with him that we don\u2019t know about. \nNow, as far as Hillary\u2019s concerned, she\u2019s going to go with what he wants. \nShe shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run. What she did is criminal with the emails. She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run. \nShe\u2019s going to have to follow his line because she\u2019s on a thread. You know, look, in real life, his Attorney General, his U.S. Attorney, his Attorney General. So his Attorney General is going to listen to him in my opinion. I think it\u2019s very dishonest what\u2019s going on with our government. \nGen. [David] Petraeus was given a life-changing sentence. Other people have been sent to jail. Petraeus was, you know, essentially \u2013 look, I don\u2019t want to get into it with the poor guy. What he went \u2013 for nothing, compared to what she did for nothing, for 5% of what she did. \nAnd Obama, I mean, she can\u2019t go against him because only does boom she gets indicted. That\u2019s the end of it. That\u2019s the end of it. \nSo when you see Hillary backing up virtually everything he says, and he\u2019s got control of her. I mean, it\u2019s just total control. \nBut I\u2019ll tell you what, she shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run. What she did was a criminal act. \nAnd remember this, this is a six-year \u2013 you have a six year statute of limitations. So she\u2019s fighting for her life. If she doesn\u2019t become president, she could have a real problem. Does that make any sense to anybody? Does that make sense to anybody? \nBecause what she did was just wrong. Okay? And you know she\u2019s been involved in corruption her whole life, whether it\u2019s Whitewater. I mean, her whole life is corruption. \nThank you very much, everybody. You just like me because my daughter happens to be Jewish. Right? She has a great husband, Jared, and I\u2019ll tell you what Ivanka could not be happier and she\u2019s very proud. The only bad news, I can\u2019t get her on Saturday. I call and I call. I can\u2019t speak to my daughter anymore on Saturdays. But that\u2019s okay. \nIt\u2019s an honor to be with you. You know, I\u2019ve devoted so much time over my life to Israel, and the other politicians they can talk but believe me they haven\u2019t done what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve received many, many awards. \nI was the Grand Marshal of the Israeli Day Parade at a very dangerous time when people said, \u201cDon\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d I walked up Fifth Avenue. I\u2019m looking up for lots of trouble. But I said, \u201cNo way am I not going to do it.\u201d And it was a rough time as you know. It was 2004, and it was a tremendously successful parade. Maybe their most successful parade that they ever had. \nSo, I\u2019m in a different position than the other candidates because I\u2019m the one candidate I don\u2019t want any of your money; I want your support but I don\u2019t want your money. \nI\u2019m self-funding my campaign. It\u2019s been an amazing experience for me because I have very little money invested so far. \nI thought by this time I\u2019d have about 30 million in ads and I have none although I took a small radio commercial the other day in Iowa. But we have virtually no money in invested in ads or advertising. And I think you as business people will feel pretty good about this and respect it. \nAt first, I was embarassed by that. I said, \u201cYou know, I think we\u2019re going to have spend money just to spend money\u201d but it\u2019s not really like a good thing to do because I am in first place by a lot. It\u2019s not even close. Every single poll, every single state. \nThe numbers just came in three minutes ago in New Hampshire \u2013 the PPP poll \u2013 Trump at 27%, the next one is 13%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 5%, and the rest are off the board. They have to drop out pretty soon I guess, right? \nMost of importantly, favorability \u2013 no, I still like the top number the most but favorability is now at 50% to 39%, which is good, and I beat Hillary in the Fox poll as you see very easily 46% to 41%. That\u2019s ultimately the most important. \nAnd you know, I\u2019ve been a tremendous fan and I\u2019ve been a tremendous contributor. I\u2019ve given a lot of money recently to Hatzalah, $100,000, emergency response. They do a fantastic job. \nAnd my father, Fred, was always a big supporter. So I grew up in that environment. I grew up in Brooklyn, Queens, and Israel was always very paramount in our mind. \nIn fact, I\u2019ve been sometimes criticized because I received so many awards from Jewish groups, and they look at my wall. It\u2019s loaded up. But now the Christians are catching up, I have to tell you. \nMy Christians are liking me a lot lately and they\u2019ve been great. They have been great. \nSo, Obama is the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to Israel. The worst. The worst. \nAnd when I see great friends of mine who are very, very pro-Israel, very \u2013 I mean, they love Israel. They love it with passion, and they\u2019re having fundraisers for Obama. I said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \nAnd it\u2019s almost like they answer me and they say, \u201cWe don\u2019t know. He comes to New York. We don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know.\u201d I said he\u2019s a disaster. \nI really believe the Iran deal. Look, I\u2019m a negotiator like you folks. We\u2019re negotiators. \nWe don\u2019t build gas stations in the middle of, as you know, Afghanistan for $43 million \u2013 can you imagine this? A small gas station \u2013 $43 million \u2013 and then they used the wrong kind of terminal because they don\u2019t sell that type of gas. Okay? $43 million for a gas station. \nHow many think they could have done it for less? Would you raise your hands please? \nBut I look at Obama, I look at that deal where we gave to Iran $150 billion. They don\u2019t need to develop nuclear weapons; they can buy them. They can buy them. It\u2019s true. Why do they have to develop them? They can buy them. We gave them $150 billion. \nThey go out and in terms of, you know, surveillance, they have the right to self-inspect. How about that? On their major, most dangerous they can self-inspect. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina", "text": "I took a deep breath and I went down and I talked about lots of things, including illegal immigration. \nAnd illegal immigration was such a big subject. And I\u2019m telling you had I not brought it up, it has turned out to be \u2013 and I took heat. I took heat like nobody has ever taken heat. Rush Limbaugh said \u201cThe most incredible incoming that I\u2019ve ever seen a human being endure\u201d. And then he doubled down a week later because I was right. \nAnd now, illegal immigration is one of the biggest things. \nAnd then you had the killing of Kate [Steinle] and the killing of Jamiel and the killing recently in California of a 66-year-old \u2013 think of it, 66-year-old \u2013 veteran, female, raped, sodomized and killed by an illegal immigrant. And many, many more. It\u2019s a huge problem. \nAnd they take our jobs and a lot of other things. \nSo all of a sudden, everyone\u2019s saying \u201cWow\u201d...and from almost at the beginning, you\u2019ve seen I\u2019ve been at the top like from almost day one. \n...The reason I tell you certain things and the reason I talk about what I\u2019ve done and lots of good things. A little thing \u2013 Wollman ice skating rink. The city couldn\u2019t get it built for high years. They were in there for like $20 million. They couldn\u2019t get it done. I went to the mayor of New York, I said, \u201cEd Koch, I\u2019ll get it done real quick.\u201d He didn\u2019t like it because he didn\u2019t want to be shown up. I said I\u2019ll do it and if it costs more than $2 million I\u2019ll pay for it. I got it built for peanuts. Got it done in four months. And we had ice skating in Central Park and I still run it. \nI did another one \u2013 I did a bigger version of that recently Ferry Point out in the Bronx. They were having \u2013 things have been under construction from anywhere between 20 and 30 years. They couldn\u2019t get it done. I got it done under a year. It\u2019s operating now. It\u2019s very successful. \nIt\u2019s what I do and that\u2019s what we need. That\u2019s what we need in our country. \nI\u2019m building on Pennsylvania Avenue an incredible hotel. One of the great hotels of the world. The Old Post Office site. Think of it. I got it in the Obama administration. Everybody was bidding. Everybody wanted it. One of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA \u2013 general services. And I got it. Can you imagine me getting it from the Obama administration? Because the GSA, who are really professionals, they want to make sure number one that it got built. So they wanted strong financials. And they also wanted a great plan. So we came up with Ivanka and my kids we came up with this incredible plan. The job is under budget, ahead of schedule. It was going to open up in \u201917 \u2013 sometime during the year \u201917. Now, it\u2019s going to open probably in September of \u201916 right before the election on Pennsylvania Avenue. \nAnd this is the kind of mindset you need. \nCarl Icahn, one of the great businessmen, and others have endorsed me. \nWe have trillions and trillions of dollars offshore. Pfizer\u2019s leaving the United States. \nIn the old days, somebody would leave for, frankly, South Carolina. They\u2019d leave New York or Florida or someplace where the taxes are lower. They\u2019d leave for North Carolina. They\u2019d leave \u2013 today they\u2019d leave this country for other countries. \nSo now, we\u2019re losing Pfizer. We\u2019re losing many of our great companies. \nWe have $2.5 trillion offshore at least. And everybody agrees it should come home \u2013 the Democrats, the Republicans. For three years, they can\u2019t make a deal. They can\u2019t make a deal because there\u2019s such gridlock. There\u2019s no leadership in Washington. \nWe will make this country so great. We have people and I\u2019ll tell you something. I\u2019ll tell you something...[interrupted by protester] said something to me the other day and what I really want to do \u2013 [interrupted by protester] \u2013 what we want to do or what I want to do is I want to be the people\u2019s president. \n...Think of this, think of this, I don\u2019t work for any of the lobbyists. I don\u2019t work for any of these people that are leading our country in the wrong direction. We don\u2019t. \n...The best thing that I\u2019ve seen in going around and the thing that I\u2019ve seen more than anything else is how smart the people are. They don\u2019t believe those people in the back that write with fork. I\u2019m telling you, they don\u2019t believe them. The people are really smart. \nWhat\u2019s giving me more inspiration than any other single thing are the people that I\u2019ve met \u2013 the incredible people of this country. \nWe\u2019re going to make America great again. And you know what? We\u2019re going to make it greater, greater, than ever before. And I love you all and thank you very much. South Carolina. Great. Thank you! We love you. Thank you! \nThey never said, \u201cHey boss, we\u2019re closing up the George Washington Bridge tonight.\u201d No, they never said that. They\u2019re talking about the weather, right? \nHe knew about it. He knew about it. Totally knew about it. He\u2019s a got a very friendly group of people over there that they don\u2019t think so. But I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s called life. You\u2019ve got to be smart in life. \nI would say there\u2019s less than 1% chance. It could be but I doubt it. He knew about it. They didn\u2019t mention at one of their meetings? I think they had breakfast like everyday or every other day. They\u2019d just say, \u201cChris, tonight we\u2019re closing up the George Washington Bridge because the mayor a certain area is against you.\u201d \u201cOh, okay.\u201d They didn\u2019t mention? Nobody believes that. \nNumber two. Nine downgrades of the state. Nine downgrades. It\u2019s a disaster. I have property over there \u2013 the taxes are through \u2013 I\u2019ll use an expression \u2013 coming out of my ears, okay? Tremendous taxes over there. You had nine downgrades. \nYou had Christie, you know, so friendly with President Obama during the flood. \nI actually called. I said, \u201cLet me ask you. Is he going to vote for Obama?\u201d I thought he was going to vote for Obama. I don\u2019t know. I think he possibly did. \nAnd Romney I was very disappointed. One of the reasons I was disappointed was he called Christie and had dinner right after the election. If Christie did that to me, I would have never spoken to him again. I would have never done it. \nSo when Chris talks about \u2013 when he talks about lack of experience \u2013 I built this incredible company. I filed papers where everyone said \u201cWow, that is unbelievable.\u201d I would have probably filed them even when I didn\u2019t run because I built a great, great company. Tremendous cash. Tremendous assets. Tremendous net worth. Very little debt. Unbelievable cash flow. And I filed. \nEverybody said \u201cNumber one, he won\u2019t run.\u201d And I ran. I took a deep breath and I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d to my wife and we came down that escalator. Right, the famous escalators. Hopefully in many years that will be a very famous scene because we will have turned around our country and that will be a positive note, okay? \nBut then they said, \u201cOh, well he announced.\u201d So these talking heads \u2013 most of whom are not even smart people, believe me. Then they\u2019d say well, they went to Ivy League college. So did I go to Ivy League college. They went to this. Most of them didn\u2019t go to Ivy League colleges by the way but they say they\u2019re brilliant. One\u2019s brilliant because he wears glasses, you know? Like Perry. Remember Perry? We don\u2019t like him. \nBut what happens is they say \u201cWell, he\u2019ll never file form A.\u201d That\u2019s basically where you sign your life away. I filed form A. \nThen they said, \u201cWell, he\u2019ll never sign his financial statement because maybe he\u2019s not as rich as everybody thinks.\u201d Then they said, \u201cAnd if he does, he\u2019ll ask for many, many delays because you\u2019re entitled to 45 day delays, delays, and you can delay it until forever. And they\u2019ll delay it until after the election.\u201d \nI said, \u201cNo\u201d so I filed it ahead of schedule. And what happened? Remember? They went down. They couldn\u2019t believe it. It was much, much, much better than anybody ever envisioned. \nI built a great company and the reason \u2013 honestly worth billions and billions of dollars. Remember that \u2013 low debt, great cash flow, and the greatest assets \u2013 Doral, Trump Tower, the Trump Building, big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco, 1290 Ave., land all over, land on the Potomac, land all over. \nIn North Carolina, I have a great piece of property. Trump National Golf Club. Some of you know it. Great, right at the best location. \nAnd what happens? What happens? So I filed and everyone said \u201cOh, I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d \nThen they said \u201cWell, maybe he won\u2019t do so well with the polls.\u201d And you know, before I went, people never believed I was going to run. They never thought I was going to run. \nAnd I told the story the other night for really the first real time. But my wife said to me \u201cYou know if you run you will win. Don\u2019t you?\u201d She\u2019s very smart. \nI said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t run, you\u2019re never going to poll before. Nobody believes you\u2019re going to run.\u201d So if they do polls like they did these early polls, they weren\u2019t great before I announced. She said, \u201cNo, the only way you\u2019re going to get a poll number is you\u2019ve got to announce.\u201d Nobody believes even though they say, even though they say you\u2019re running, it doesn\u2019t matter. Nobody believes you\u2019re running. \nSo I said, \u201cAll right.\u201d I\u2019m getting these lousy early numbers and I\u2019m saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to run and find out it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d I don\u2019t want to be embarrassed like Lindsey Graham and all these guys who have nothing. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. \nSo I said, \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s take it.\u201d \nSo we go down on the escalator. You know what I did? You remember I took a deep breath because I\u2019m telling you and you know what I\u2019m talking about the press down there look like the Academy Awards. There were so many cameras. I have never seen anything like it. The entire atrium of Trump Tower was packed with cameras and press. And I just said, \u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d to my wife. \nSo when I started this whole quest \u2013 I mean, who knew it was going to turn into this? It\u2019s been an amazing thing. No matter where I go, I have tremendous crowds, packed crowds, packed. \nWe went to Dallas \u2013 20,000 people in Dallas. 25,000 people. Mobile, Alabama \u2013 35,000 people. Here, every time I come to South Carolina, every time I go to North Carolina, every time I go to Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia, wherever I go \u2013 Florida \u2013 we have crowds that are maxed. The only problem we have is the size of the room \u2013 thousands of people outside trying to get in. Usually I do a double. I go talk to them for a while, which I wouldn\u2019t say I exactly love doing after the first one. \nBut there is an unbelievable love in these rooms \u2013 all the same. I love you too. I love you...Thank you. Thank you. I love you too. \nThere\u2019s an unbelievable love in all of these places \u2013 Oklahoma \u2013 20,000 people standing in a park on quick notice. There\u2019s an unbelievable love. And there\u2019s an unbelievable love of the country. We want to see good things. We don\u2019t want to be bad people. We don\u2019t want to be tough and nasty. We believe in the Constitution more than anybody. \nBut we can\u2019t let people use and abuse our rights. We can\u2019t let people kill us. They want to kill us. They want to destroy us. We can\u2019t let it happen. We just can\u2019t let it happen. \nAnd I have a friend who\u2019s a very, very successful man, and I went to one event \u2013 he came with me. We had 24,000 people. And this guy\u2019s a real tough cookie. He\u2019s a great financial guy. One of the guys I\u2019d definitely use to negotiate with Japan, China. Believe me, you\u2019re going to be in good shape when that happens. We won\u2019t have these characters. \nYou know, this whole thing with all of these guys. By the way, I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s self-funding my campaign. Everyone else is controlled. Only one. I\u2019m the only one. Only one. \nI\u2019m self-funding my campaign. And these other guys. You know, they\u2019re getting millions and millions of dollars from people I know. \nI have one guy came and wanted to give me a lot of money. I said, \u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t take it. I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d I can\u2019t take it, which is very sort of like for me to not take money \u2013 my whole life I\u2019ve been taking money. Now I\u2019m sort of like what am I doing? But came in and I said, \u201cSo what are you going to do? I don\u2019t want your money.\u201d And he said, \u201cI got to go someplace else.\u201d They\u2019re like gamblers. They\u2019re like gamblers. But I said, \u201cYou like me best.\u201d \u201cI like you best but I\u2019m going to go someplace else.\u201d Because they want to be part \u2013 they want to \u2013 \n...Let me tell you, who is more than me? I gave millions to these guys. Nobody knows the system better than me. I knew it from the other side. Don\u2019t forget, I was the fair-haired boy. I was like the establishment. They\u2019d all come to me, and I\u2019d give them all money I write checks sometimes to Senators whatever the max \u2013 bing, bing, bing. \nI used to say \u201cSenators, don\u2019t come to my office. Anybody that\u2019s a U.S. Senator that calls me, we\u2019ll send you a campaign contribution.\u201d \nBut you know what? I\u2019ll tell you something. In the end, the people that gives these millions of dollars to these horrible, corrupt PACS \u2013 they\u2019re corrupt \u2013 they totally control Bush and Rubio and I won\u2019t say Cruz because he\u2019s been very nice to me. Nah, he\u2019s been nice. He\u2019s got to hit me first. Once he hits me, I promise you. I promise you. \nNo, I\u2019ve been nice to Christie but he really hit me today. Chris Christie. I mean, I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s a friend of mine but he\u2019s not doing well in the polls and he really, really hit me today. He hated this and yet he said anybody could come. You\u2019ve got to look at some of the statements from the past. But he really hit me on the whole thing that we have to stop the Muslims until we find out what\u2019s going on. \nDoes that make sense by the way? Until we find out. \nAnd he talked about \u2013 that\u2019s inexperience and you know in other words he has experience right? \nBut that\u2019s the statement of an inexperienced man...About we have to stop people that want to kill us from coming in. Does that sound like inexperienced? \nSo Chris, who\u2019s a friend of mine, he hit me hard. And I said I got to hit him at least once. So I won\u2019t do this a lot. \nLook, here\u2019s the story. The George Washington Bridge. He knew about it. \nHey, how do you have breakfast with people everyday of your lives, they\u2019re closing up the largest bridge in the world, the biggest in the United States, traffic flowing during rush hour. People couldn\u2019t get across for 6, 7 hours. Ambulances, fire trucks. They\u2019re with him all the time \u2013 the people that did it. \nNow, we can be weak. We can be ineffective. We can be foolish. \n...[Interrupted by protester]\n \n...So prior to Paris, which was a disaster, which by the way if some of the people in those places where it was slaughter, absolute slaughter, had guns, you wouldn\u2019t have had the carnage that you had in Paris. You wouldn\u2019t had that carnage. If they had guns, you wouldn\u2019t had that carnage. \nSo important the Second Amendment. We have to preserve it and cherish it. And we can\u2019t let these weak leaders diminish it. \nIf they had guns in Paris, if five people in that room, Paris and France has probably the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and it was like target practice. \u201cCome over here. Boom! Come over here. Boom!\u201d People are sitting by the hundreds and many others are going to be dying. They\u2019re sitting in the hospital in many cases waiting to die. \nNow, the same thing a few days ago in California. No guns. We didn\u2019t have guns. The bad guys had the guns. \nAnd these young people \u2013 and I tell the press you\u2019ve got to stop calling them \u201cmasterminds\u201d \u2013 these are dirty, rotten scums. These aren\u2019t masterminds. \nRemember the guy in Paris with the big dirty hat? Remember the guy in Paris \u2013 the \u201cmastermind\u201d. I was watching all the networks. I won\u2019t mention who but some of them disgusted me. \u201cThe mastermind is on the loose.\u201d \nAnd we have kids that are watching the Internet and they want to be masterminds and then you wonder why do we lose all these kids \u2013 they go over there. They\u2019re young. They\u2019re impressionable. They go over there and they want to join ISIS. \nAnd we have our anchors \u2013 I think I got them mostly stopped. Did you notice that? I don\u2019t hear it too much. But they say \u201cthe young mastermind\u201d. Oh, he\u2019s brilliant. Young man, he\u2019s brilliant. \nI don\u2019t even he\u2019s got a high IQ...In Paris, I call him the guy with the dirty filthy hat. Okay? Not a smart guy. A dummy. Puts people in there \u2013 mastermind \u2013 bing, bing, bing, it\u2019s like shooting everybody. You\u2019ve got to be a mastermind. \nSo the press has to be responsible. They\u2019re not being responsible because we\u2019re losing a lot of people because of the Internet. \nAnd we have to do something. We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what\u2019s happening. We have to talk to them. Maybe in certain areas closing that Internet up in some way. \nSomebody will \u201cOh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech\u201d. These are foolish people. We have a lot of foolish people. We have a lot of foolish people. \nWe\u2019ve got to maybe do something with the Internet because they are recruiting by the thousands. They\u2019re leaving our country. And then when they come back, we take them back. \u201cOh, come on back. Where were you?\u201d \u201cI was fighting for ISIS.\u201d \u201cOh, come on back. Go home. Enjoy yourself.\u201d \nWhen they leave our country and they go to fight for ISIS or any of the other groups, they never come back. They never can come back. They never can come back. They can never, ever, ever come back. It\u2019s over. \nHow about that? And now that they\u2019ve become radicalized, they\u2019re totally radicalized. \nAnd how about the woman? She was in Pakistan then Saudi Arabia. She comes in on an engagement deal and she radicalized the guy. Probably a guy who couldn\u2019t get women. I don\u2019t know what the hell his problem is. It\u2019s probably the first women he\u2019s ever had. I don\u2019t know what was going on. But he became radicalized quickly. Notice how easy it is? He becomes radicalized and then they go on a spree. \nFolks, those days are over. Those days are over. We have to be tough. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant. \nYes, we have to look at mosques and we have to respect mosques. But yes, we have to look at mosques. We have no choice. We have to see what\u2019s happening because something is happening in there. Man, there\u2019s anger. There\u2019s anger. And we have to know about it. We can\u2019t be these people that are sitting back like in the World Trade Center, like so many different things. \nWe can\u2019t be people that knew what was going on two weeks ago in California, probably for months they knew what was going on and they didn\u2019t want to tell anybody. We can\u2019t be that. \nWe have to be strong. When we see violations, you have to report those violations and quickly. Don\u2019t worry about profiling. I promise I will defend you from profiling. I promise. \nSo, we put out a statement today. We watched this. And it\u2019s impossible to watch this gross incompetence but I watched last night. \nAnd we put out a statement a little while ago and these people are going crazy... \nShall I read you the statement? \nDonald J. Trump is calling for \u2013 now, you\u2019ve got to listen to this because this is pretty heavy stuff and it\u2019s common sense and we have to do it. Remember the poll numbers. 25%, 51%. Remember the poll numbers. So remember this. So listen. \nDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. \nWe have no choice. We have no choice. We have no choice. \nAccording to Pew Research, among others, there is a great hatred toward Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. \nMost recently, a poll from Center for Security Policy released data showing 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans \u2013 these are people that are here by the way, people that are here \u2013 25% not 1%. By the way, 1% would be unacceptable. 1% is unacceptable. 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as part \u2013 think of that \u2013 as part of the global jihad. \nThey want to change your religion. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. Not going to happen. \nAs part of the global jihad. And 51% of those polled agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Sharia. You know what Sharia is. 51%. \nSharia authorizes \u2013 now look, this is, I mean, it\u2019s terrible. Sharia authorizes such atrocities as murders against non-believers who won\u2019t convert, beheadings, and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans especially women. I mean, you look \u2013 especially women. Tough stuff. \nAnd we have a president that won\u2019t even mention the term and you\u2019re talking about numbers like this. \nMr. Trump stated without looking at the various polling data, it\u2019s obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension... \nWhere the hatred comes from and why, we\u2019ll have to determine. We\u2019ll have to figure it out. We have to figure it out. We can\u2019t live like this. It\u2019s going to get worse and worse. You\u2019re going to have more World Trade Centers. It\u2019s going to get worse and worse folks. \nWe could be politically correct and we can be stupid but it\u2019s going to get worse and worse. \nUntil we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad. \nThese are people only believe in jihad. They don\u2019t want our system. They don\u2019t want our system and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. They have no respect for human life. \nI had one the other day where I finished the speech and they said \u201cOh, Trump was interrupted and he left early.\u201d I spoke for like 45, 50 minutes. I then answered questions and then I went around, you know, everybody knew it was false. \nAmazingly, there\u2019s a media group that calls the media and the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from NBC. She\u2019s back there. Little Katie. She\u2019s back there. What a lie it was. No, what a lie \u2013 Katie Tur \u2013 what a lie it was from NBC to have written that. It was a total lie. And they did a story where they \u2013 I didn\u2019t know they had a group like this where they actually criticized the media. And they said it was a total lie. And I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. \nAnd then other people pick it up. You know it\u2019s NBC so somebody picks it up. Third rate reporter. Remember that. Third rate. Third rate. \nSo I said here the mainstream media wants to surrender our Constitution and our constitutional rights. And I don\u2019t want that. I want ISIS to surrender. Okay? I want ISIS to surrender. Very simple. \nIt\u2019s very simple. So here\u2019s what happened. It\u2019s been a little controversial. It\u2019s been a great day because the poll numbers are through the roof. I like that. \nBut I have more...I wish we could call \u2013 is there any way we could call the election tomorrow? Wouldn\u2019t you love that? \nNow they\u2019re coming at us in full force. They\u2019re coming \u2013 not coming at me. They\u2019re coming at all of us. They\u2019re coming at all of us. Because you know, we have a noisy majority. They used to call it the quiet majority. People are fed up. They\u2019re fed up with incompetence. They\u2019re fed up with stupid leaders. They\u2019re fed up with stupid people. \nThey are fed up with stupid people, where our president makes a deal for Sergeant Bergdahl, a dirty, rotten, no good traitor who \u2013 think of it. They knew he was a traitor because a general and a colonel went to see his group. Six people were killed looking for him. Okay? Six people were killed. Young. Unbelievable. I watched the parents on television. I\u2019ve seen the parents. But I watched the parents on television devastated, will never be the same. They left to try to bring them back. He left. He deserted. \nYou know, in the old days when we were strong country it would be boom, gone. It was called desertion. Now I heard the other day they won\u2019t even do anything to him. Can you believe it? They think he\u2019s going to get away with nothing. He\u2019s going to have nothing. \nSo he left. Oh, they treated him pretty rough though. He got in there, he said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done this. This isn\u2019t working out the way I thought.\u201d \nAnyways, so we get him back and here\u2019s the deal we made. We get a dirty, no good traitor. Six people killed...They get five of their greatest killers that they\u2019ve been after \u2013 after \u2013 think of it for six years. In fact, I hear nine years. \nSo they get these \u2013 right now have gone \u2013 they\u2019re out in the battlefield, trying to kill everybody in front of them including you folks, I\u2019d hate to tell you. \nSo we get Bergdahl and they get five of the killers that they\u2019ve wanted for many years. That\u2019s the way we do it.  \nThe Iran deal. We gave them $150 billion. It\u2019s called amateur night. We gave them $150 billion. 24 days \u2013 24 days \u2013 we think there\u2019s something wrong, 24 days we have to wait but it\u2019s much longer than that because there\u2019s a whole process before the clock starts ticking. So it could be forever. \nBut the best is where they have the right to self-inspect. \u201cAre you doing nuclear weapons over there?\u201d \u201cOh, we\u2019ll inspect tomorrow.\u201d \u201cOh no, we\u2019re not doing nuclear weapons.\u201d \nYou know, the Persians are great negotiators. Always have been. And somebody would say that\u2019s profiling. Trust me, they\u2019re great negotiators. \nAnd Kerry is a horrible negotiator and Obama is a horrible negotiator. Horrible. He\u2019s a horrible negotiator. These people are horrible. \nI always Obama would be a unifier. I never thought of him as being like a divider because I said \u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be a good president.\u201d \nI backed McCain; he lost by the way. And you know, I don\u2019t blame McCain for losing because a lot of bad things will happen; it was a tough one. But I backed McCain; he lost. I backed Romney; he should have won but he sort of went away on vacation or something the last month and he lost. And I said, \u201cThis time I\u2019m going to do it myself. We\u2019re not going to lose.\u201d We\u2019re not going to lose. We\u2019re not losing. \nAnd the recent Fox poll that just came out has me beating Hillary very easily one on one. I love that. That\u2019s so important. \nYou know, we had a situation in California very recently where somebody was making bombs in an apartment. The mother saw them. The mother didn\u2019t notice anything wrong. I watched the sister being interviewed. Believe me, in my opinion, she was lying like crazy. I watched that interview. \u201cOh, my brother was such a wonderful guy. I didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d \nAnd I watched the next door neighbor saying, \u201cOh, well we didn\u2019t report them because we didn\u2019t want to racially profile or we didn\u2019t want to profile.\u201d Give me a break. Give me a break. \nWe\u2019re like the stupid country in so many different ways. It\u2019s so \u2013 can you imagine what our great leaders of the past would have said with the kind of crap that\u2019s happening with us? \nThey didn\u2019t want to report them because they thought it was profiling. \nOkay, they saw bombs. They saw, you know, the pipe bombs only this wasn\u2019t to build a bathroom. When a bomb is this long, can\u2019t put too many of them together for a bathroom, right? And we thought they maybe but we didn\u2019t want to racially profile. Oh, okay, you\u2019re okay, you\u2019re innocent. \nOr how about where the families and the girlfriends and the wives and everything and they go back to World Trade Center \u2013 the worst, worse than Pearl Harbor because with the World Trade Center they were killing innocent civilians. At least while it was a dirty, rotten sneak attack, at least they were...but while it was an attack, at least it was military. But this was an attack on the World Trade Center. \nSo, what\u2019s happened is we\u2019re out of control. We have no idea who\u2019s coming into our country. We have no idea if they love us or if they hate us. We have no idea if they want to bomb us. We have no idea what\u2019s going on. \nAnd then I looked at poll numbers and I don\u2019t mean polls where I\u2019m winning; those numbers I like looking at. These numbers I hated to look at. And it\u2019s very, very sad. \nI\u2019ll go after some of the numbers. 25% of those polled and this was from the Center for Security Policy \u2013 very highly respected group of people who I know actually. \nThis is people living in this country. 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans is justified as Muslims. 25%. \n51% of the Muslims living in this country \u2013 by the way, I have friends that are Muslims; they\u2019re great people. But they know we have a problem. They know we have a real problem. Because something\u2019s going on, and we can\u2019t put up with it, folks. We can\u2019t put up with it. \n51% \u2013 51% highly respected number of polling groups want to be governed according to Sharia. You know what Sharia is. \nSo I wrote this out. The mainstream media wants to surrender the Constitution. The mainstream media \u2013 these people back here. They\u2019re the worst. They are so dishonest. No, no, they\u2019re so dishonest. They are so dishonest. \nI mean, I have one from NBC, a reporter from NBC, and actually another one from CBS, they actually in Columbus, Ohio, I had a tremendous crowd like 10,000 people. It was a love fest. It went on for a long time. Everybody stayed right \u2019tis the end. I had one of the politicians \u2013 Kasich \u2013 who is just getting \u2013 he\u2019s a horrible debater...He made a statement that \u201cOh, they left after 10 minutes.\u201d Now, the press was there. They saw it. Nobody said it was a lie. It was a total lie. In fact, I had more people at the end than I had at the beginning. Nobody\u2019s leaving. Nobody\u2019s leaving here except for the one person that was screaming. \nSo, we asked the press to report that it was a total lie and they didn\u2019t want to do that because it\u2019s not their thing to do. \nYou know, we get the biggest crowds. They don\u2019t want to show this crowd tonight. They\u2019re not going to show all the people outside trying to get in. They don\u2019t do that. They have the cameras right in my face. I say fan the crowd just to show \u2013 look at all the people over here. It\u2019s a record in the history of this ship. But they don\u2019t show it. They don\u2019t show it. No, no. And I say fan it and they never ever fan it. I say fan the crowd and they never fan it. And yet, I guarantee you that that young woman that just got taken out after interrupting us three times, I guarantee the cameras will be on her. I guarantee. It\u2019s disgusting. Disgusting. \n...And by the way, some of the media\u2019s terrific but most of it 70%, 75% is absolute dishonest, absolute scum. Remember that. Scum. Scum. They\u2019re totally dishonest people.\n... \nYou know, the funny thing is I look at Democrats and liberals and conservatives and Republicans \u2013 wouldn\u2019t it be good all of us if we can get together and really make our country great again? Is that what we want to do? \nI\u2019ll bet you that if I spoke to that young woman, that quickly I really think I can convince her that we\u2019re all in this together, folks. We want to have a strong country. Right? \n...But you know, if you think about it and you\u2019ll have some that can never be satisfied no matter what. They\u2019re just troublemakers, et cetera, et cetera. But most people aren\u2019t and they believe something. And I have some very smart friends don\u2019t agree with me; they agree with the other side. \nBut I really believe that if you took it about making America great, we have to be strong, we have to be vigilant, and if we\u2019re not vigilant \u2013 [interrupted by protester] \u2013 that was the same person. I\u2019ve got to tell you, so far, the security is not doing a great job in here, I\u2019ll tell you that. That was the same person. You can do very nice but why don\u2019t you get her out because honestly it\u2019s inappropriate. So security, strengthen yourself up. \nSee, our country has this kind of security. That\u2019s the problem we have...Treat her very nicely please but she should now be taken out. Same person. One person. It\u2019s one person. They let her out. They gave her a second chance and the same thing happens. \nBut you would think that everybody we\u2019re all on the same basket that everybody every single person \u2013 [interrupted by protester]\n \n...So you would think that if we could get together, we\u2019d all be in the same boat. \nNow, last night we all saw and we witnessed something that I thought was highly inappropriate. \nIn fact, I tweeted \u201cIs that all there is?\u201d about the president\u2019s speech and I wrote something today that I think is very, very salient, very important, and probably not politically correct but I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care. \nWe owe $21 trillion in the very near future. We\u2019re really in trouble. We have to rebuild our country. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. We have to rebuild our military. \nAnd yet, we do deals with China where there\u2019s a trade imbalance of over $400 billion a year in their favor, by the way, in case you had any question. \nJapan \u2013 they send their cars by the millions. $70 billion a year imbalance. That\u2019s like a loss. \nYou look at Mexico. We\u2019re going to build a wall. It will be a real wall. It will be a real wall. Gonna happen. It\u2019s gonna happen. \nThe people I\u2019m dealing with \u2013 and you know, I really focus on Hillary later because I have to get through these 15 people. You know, there\u2019s 15 of us. \nI had Perry came at me strong; he went down. I had Gov. Walker, nice guy, he went down. Every guy that attacks me so far they\u2019ve all gone down. We\u2019ve got to keep it that way, right? \nI mean, Lindsey Graham. He\u2019s at zero. He\u2019s at zero. Zero. \nLet me ask you a question. I don\u2019t get Lindsey Graham. I don\u2019t get him...He\u2019s literally at zero. You see him. And he keeps talking. He gets so much television. I mean, he\u2019s on television all the time and he doesn\u2019t go up. He\u2019s at zero, folks. \nHis ideas are so bad. I\u2019m more militaristic than him. But I know how to win; he doesn\u2019t. He just wants to attack everything. He doesn\u2019t know where the hell \u2013 ra ha. \nAnd he always sits with John McCain. It\u2019s like they\u2019re the Bobbsey twins. They\u2019re always sitting together. No, it\u2019s true. Do you ever notice? Sometimes I want to see him by himself. He\u2019s always sitting with John McCain, who\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not knocking it. But you got to know what to do. \nNow me, I was against the war in Iraq. So everyone says, you have the right temperament \u2013 I have a great temperament. But you\u2019ve got to attack. If you\u2019ve got to do something, you\u2019ve got to know what you\u2019re doing. \nI said if you attack Iraq and you wipe it out, Iran is going to take over the entire Middle East because you\u2019re going to ruin the balance. It was so simple to me. \nAnd actually they sent a group from the White House to see me because I got so much publicity, so much publicity that they sent a group from the White House to see Mr. Trump. I said, \u201cFellas, you\u2019re going to have Iran take over the Middle East and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d \nAnd Iran\u2019s going to take over Iraq as sure as you\u2019re sitting there. \nAnd by the way, Iraq, with the second largest oil reserves anywhere in the world. We lost of thousands of lives. We have wounded warriors all over the place. $2 trillion. We have nothing. We got nothing. We have absolutely nothing. And we left. \nAnd we have a president \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t have been there but then we shouldn\u2019t have left the way we left. \n... [Interrupted by protester]\n \nYou know in many ways, it\u2019s the cheapest thing we can do. The cheapest thing. Instead of fighting these wars that we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing and we have leaders that are afraid to do anything, we\u2019re going to make it so great, so strong that people \u2013 gosh, they\u2019re not messing. They\u2019re not messing. \nAnd we\u2019re going to take care of our great vets, our wounded warriors. We\u2019re going to take care of them. Because they \u2013 thank you, they are not being taken care of. \nWe have illegal immigrants that are taken care of better than our incredible veterans and it\u2019s not going to happen any longer. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. \nSo with ISIS \u2013 Trump 46%. Can you imagine that? With all of these characters running. \nOn foreign policy, Trump way up. And you know, in theory you could say \u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s not my thing.\u201d But people want to see strong, they want to see strength, they want to see protection, they want to be protected. And that\u2019s it. \nI watched last night and I watched the president truly that didn\u2019t know what he was doing. He didn\u2019t know why he was there. He refuses to use the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d. He refuses to use the term. \nI don\u2019t even know if he knows what the hell is going on. I really don\u2019t. \nAnd then we\u2019re looking at Hillary Clinton. Honestly, I know Hillary. It\u2019s just going to be an extension of Obama. I think maybe worse. \nShe\u2019s got no strength. She\u2019s got no stamina. Remember that. \nYou don\u2019t need a president with no strength or stamina when we\u2019re being ripped off on trade, we\u2019re being ripped off on Obamacare, which is going to be repealed and replaced by something really good. \nWhen our soldiers aren\u2019t being taken care of, when our military is never been like it is today. \nOne of the generals was on television, as usual, saying that we\u2019re the least prepared now than anytime that he\u2019s ever seen it and he\u2019s been there a long time retiring. That\u2019s how we are. \nIn the most dangerous world we\u2019ve ever had because of the power of weapons, we have people that don\u2019t know \u2013 they don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m telling you. I watch them. I watch these generals being interviewed. \nDo you think Gen. George Patton would be interviewed? \n...They\u2019d be interviewed after total and complete victory. \nGen. Douglas MacArthur. They\u2019re not big for interviews. You know, they shoot first, they talk later. \nThese guys \u2013 and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have to. \nYou know, just so you understand, Bush \u2013 Bush, he said yesterday he was being interviewed, he said that he was talking about me. He was saying the nicest things about me. Of course, he says he\u2019ll be elected. He\u2019s at what 3%? Right? \nNo, but he said some things and I was like \u2013 I said \u201cWho says that about an opponent? You don\u2019t say those things.\u201d You\u2019ll find out what he said. But he said very nice things. \nBut, if you look at what happens where he is upset with me because he says the tone \u2013 the tone \u2013 of Donald Trump is not nice. \nAnd I say it all the time. We have people whose heads are being chopped off in the Middle East because they\u2019re Christian and for other reasons. They\u2019re being dumped and drowned in steel cages. And we talk about my tone. \nHillary said the same thing. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s tone is not nice.\u201d \nThese people are living in a different planet. Different planet. \nAnd remember what I said about Hillary. We need somebody who\u2019s strong. We need somebody with incredible energy but incredible intelligence and all of those  things. \nYou know, I know a lot of tough people but they\u2019re not smart. That\u2019s no good. They\u2019re easy. \nWe need tough. We need smart. We need like every character. We are so far behind the eight ball in this country. \nWe owe $19 trillion. The budget they signed two weeks ago is going to make it $21 trillion. It\u2019s a \u2013 think of it. Trillion. Trillion. Trillion dollars. Who the hell ever heard of the word 10 years ago? There was no such word. \nWow. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. \nWe start by paying our great respects to Pearl Harbor. \nWe don\u2019t want that stuff. We don\u2019t want World Trade Centers. We don\u2019t want that ever happen to us again. It\u2019s not going to happen to us again. \nSo I want to thank everybody for being here. It\u2019s a great honor. \nThey have thousands of people outside and sometimes they\u2019ll say \u201cWould you like to wait about an hour until they all come in?\u201d But we can\u2019t get them in anyways so what difference there. We all got lucky. We\u2019re together tonight. Thank you. \nSo we have a lot of big news today. To me, very big was CNN just came out with a new poll about an hour ago and Iowa \u2013 great, great state \u2013 and in Iowa, Trump 33%. Beating everybody by a lot. You have Cruz at 20% and Carson at 16% and going down and Rubio at 11% and Bush at 4%. But it\u2019s Trump at 33%. It just came out. It\u2019s Iowa \u2013 we love Iowa. \nBy the way, great ship named after Iowa too. I\u2019ve been on that one too. A really great one. \nThe other big poll that came out just two days ago was the national poll. Trump 36% and then I won\u2019t even mention the other numbers because they\u2019re so low. \nYou know, when you have so many people running \u2013 we had 17 and then they started to drop. Ding. Bing. I love it. I love it. And you\u2019ll be losing a lot over the next little while. I would imagine. I don\u2019t know. When somebody\u2019s down at zero I would think that eventually they\u2019ll drop out. The only difference is there\u2019s nothing to pick up if there is zero. What do you pick up? So anyways you\u2019ll be seeing that. \nOne of the things I think that\u2019s so important because to me very important in the same poll, which is the big national CNN poll, on the economy \u2013 so important \u2013 Trump 55%. Everyone else nothing. \nOn the budget \u2013 I\u2019m really good at these things \u2013 economy, budgets. I sort of expected this. On the budget, Trump \u2013 this is with 15 people remaining \u2013 Trump 51%. Everyone else bing. \nOh, here\u2019s one that I started and I took a lot of heat. I took a lot of heat. Sort of like the one we\u2019re talking about today. I guess you\u2019ve heard a little bit about it. But I\u2019ve taken a lot of heat on this one. Illegal immigration. Now, had I not brought that up in Trump Tower in June when I announced that I was going to run for president, which takes courage to run for president, believe me. \nYou know, all of my life, I\u2019ve heard that if you\u2019re a successful person, especially if you have very success \u2013 you\u2019ve done a lot of things, a lot of deals, a lot of everything, you can\u2019t run for president. \nAnd yet, that\u2019s the kind of mindset and thinking this country needs. \nWe\u2019re being run by people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. Very sad. \nOn illegal immigration, Trump 48%. That\u2019s with 15 people. Everyone else, no good. \nOn a thing called ISIS...oh, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll have plenty \u2013 we\u2019ll talk a lot about ISIS. Can you believe it? \nHere we have generals. They go on television and talk. They do all talk. You people \u2013 a lot of military people here. Who\u2019s military here? All right, I love you. \nBy the way, speaking of it, we\u2019re going to make our military so strong, so powerful, so great, nobody\u2019s ever going to mess with us again. Nobody. They\u2019re never going to mess with us. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Hilton Head, South Carolina", "text": "I always talk about Ford. They\u2019re going to build a plant \u2013 $2.5 billion in Mexico. Not going to happen with me. That stuff. Those deals are no good. \nFord\u2019s leaving. They\u2019re closing plants all over Michigan to build a plant in Mexico. How the hell does that help us? Okay? Who are the people that think this is a good thing for us? \nAnd in the meantime in Michigan and other places, we have plants closing all over the place. And they\u2019re spending \u2013 think about it $2.5 billion. Then they\u2019re going to sell cars, trucks, and parts into the United States. No tax, no nothing? I\u2019ll say you\u2019re going to have to pay a tax folks and you know what? Ford will say if I have to pay a tax, we\u2019re going to stay in the United States. I mean, it\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s very simple. \nHow about two weeks ago, Nabisco announced the big \u2013 they announced they\u2019re going to leave Chicago with one of their big plants. They\u2019re going to move it to Mexico. What\u2019s my statement? We\u2019re not eating Oreos anymore. No more. But I don\u2019t want this. Not going to happen. \nThey\u2019re going to make product and they\u2019re going to sell it into the United States? Not going to happen. It\u2019s not going to happen. \nAnd by the way, I\u2019m a free trader. I believe. But we\u2019ve got to be smart. We\u2019ve got to get something. We don\u2019t get anything out of anything. We don\u2019t get anything. We lose on everything. \nThat Iran deal was a disaster. By the way, think of the Iran deal for one second. I always said and this came to me two weeks ago. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of it sooner. Very disappointed with myself. \nThe Iran deal is the worst deal I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated. Okay? I\u2019m wrong. You know what the worse deal is? Iran is a part of that one too. We gave them Iraq. That\u2019s even better. Think of it. We gave Iran Iraq. Iran has the biggest \u2013 think of it. They\u2019re going to have the richest. If you go to Iraq, take a look. Among the largest oil reserves in the world. We gave them by decapitating Iraq and then leaving. Because frankly once we did it, we should have kept 20,000 troops. We give Iraq. \nSo not only did they make a great deal in terms of the Iran deal that we know having to do with nuclear, we also gave them Iraq. We gave them Iraq that they\u2019ve been after for 100 years. We handed it to them. \nSo now, they have the largest oil reserves in the world. That\u2019s even better than the original deal. \nI mean, whoever is representing Iran is doing a hell of a job. Okay? If that was a stock, you\u2019ve got to buy some. \nSo, we are not going to have deals like that with me. It\u2019s not going to happen. We\u2019re going to become rich again. We\u2019re going to become safe again. And we\u2019re going to become strong again. \nAnd you\u2019re going to remember this. It\u2019s going to be an important moment for all of us. \nThe one thing we\u2019re going to say and I have to ask you to do \u2013 go out and vote. It\u2019s going to be your turn. \n...Remember, it starts on Feb. 1st with Iowa. We\u2019re going to New Hampshire. Then we go to the finals. Three weeks. \nWe\u2019ve got four weeks to go and then we have three weeks after we start. \nNo matter what\u2019s going on in your life, you got to go and vote because if you don\u2019t it\u2019s not going to happen. But don\u2019t sit back and say \u201cOh, Trump\u2019s going to do well.\u201d The more we can win by, you know, the more power we have in a sense because it\u2019s like a mandate. But you\u2019ve got to go out and vote. \nAnd I will tell you this. It\u2019s been an honor to be here. I love this area. I love the people here. It\u2019s been an honor. \nBut we will make America great again. I promise. Thank you. \nNow, here\u2019s the story...So I announced and I was talking about trade. I was talking about the wall. I was talking about the borders. I was talking about Obamacare. \nI was talking about \u2013 the Second Amendment will be saved by the way. The Second Amendment. It will be saved. The Second Amendment is going to be with us if I\u2019m president. You know, they\u2019re doing everything. They want to get rid of the bullets now. They\u2019re doing everything they can. \nThink of Paris. Think of Los Angeles. Think if you had some guns in Paris on the good side. They had no guns. Paris is the toughest gun laws in the world, folks, and France, I mean, you get caught with a gun it\u2019s \u2013 the only one who has guns is the bad guys. So they go into these various places. They call the guy the mastermind. He\u2019s a moron. I mean, this guy was a moron. I call him the guy with the dirty hat. They got him so good. And by the way, the French police did a great job and our Los Angeles Police did a phenomenal job. They did a great job. \nWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if let\u2019s see, this guy right here in front of me, he\u2019s a tough guy with a lousy head of hair but he\u2019s a strong-looking guy. Right here. This guy right there. See? And that one. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if they had a gun on their waist? Someone. Him. Him. Him. So that when they started \u2013 you know what they were doing in Paris? \u201cGet over here\u201d \u2013 boom. \u201cGet over here\u201d \u2013 boom. \u201cYour turn. Get over here\u201d \u2013 boom. 130 people with more to follow because there are people that are so badly injured right now in hospitals. Other people are going to die. \nSame thing over there. These are people that gave a party in honor of their marriage. There\u2019s something going on, folks. It\u2019s wrong. They gave them a party. They worked there. They gave them a party. She came on a fiancee permit or some nonsense, and she was radicalized. And he was probably radicalized by her or he was already radicalized. And people knew that they were radicalized. And people in the area knew that they had bombs \u2013 who the hell doesn\u2019t know your next door neighbor and they didn\u2019t want to talk about it. You\u2019ve got to report these people. We\u2019ve got a real problem. You\u2019ve got to report them. \nNo more nonsense. They didn\u2019t report them. And the reason they didn\u2019t is because they don\u2019t disagree with them so much. Okay? Believe me. It\u2019s not because they\u2019re afraid. You saw the one that wasn\u2019t politically correct to report them. They didn\u2019t want to report them. I mean, give me a break. So we have to change. \nSo it started off with me where I was going to talk about trade. I was talk about all of the things. I was going to talk about the military and building it up. I was going to do all of this. \nBut after Paris and California and there\u2019ll be others because they have no fear of us. \nBut after Paris and California, I\u2019ve totally changed and my poll numbers went up 10 points. It\u2019s amazing. It went up 10 points. I said, \u201cWhat you think it was the debates?\u201d Because I did good in the debates. They said \u201cNo, people view you as a tough cookie that\u2019s not going to take this crap.\u201d That\u2019s what it is. \nAnd now I talk about protection. I talk about \u2013 trust me. The trade. Oh, that\u2019s so easy for me. I\u2019ve got the greatest guys in the world. They\u2019re going to come and they\u2019re going to do a great job. I\u2019m going to do some myself.  \n...You know, Hillary said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019d like to run against Trump.\u201d \nBelieve me, this poor Chuck Todd, Meet the Press. His show is dying. And he keeps saying do it but I never liked that. You know, he never treated me fairly. So I do his show. He gets his highest rating he has in years. He went from like \u2013 believe me, I won\u2019t even give you the numbers. They were massive. The numbers. Right? \nI saved his life. And then he goes, \u201cHillary Clinton said that she would most like to run against Donald Trump.\u201d Trust me. The last person \u2013 she\u2019s already gotten a dose of it last night. Do you agree? \nShe had a tough night. She had a tough night looking at the beauty pageants. Okay? \nSo Hillary Clinton said and here\u2019s Chuck Todd and he\u2019s a nice guy. I\u2019m not trying to knock him. Please don\u2019t be insulted, Chuck...But he doesn\u2019t treat me right. \nSo he goes, \u201cThe Clinton campaign said they most like to run against Trump.\u201d Like I\u2019m some kind of a sap. \nSo I called him. I say, \u201cChuck, let me explain something. When they say they want to run against me, that means they don\u2019t want to run against me. Do you understand that?\u201d \n...It\u2019s reverse psychology. They say they want to run against me. First of all, I\u2019m winning and tied in the polls now and I haven\u2019t even hit her yet. But look at what happened to all the guys I hit. They\u2019re gone-zo. They\u2019re gone. Or they\u2019re failing badly. Okay? Or they\u2019ll be gone soon. \nBut Hillary Clinton. Think of it. I said \u201cSo, Chuck, report it like properly. Trust me. They don\u2019t want to run against Trump.\u201d The last thing she wants in her whole life. This was only \u2013 I did this like in 15 minutes what happened to them. Because the husband wants to come and she wants to accuse me of things. And the husband\u2019s one of the great abusers of the world. Give me a break. Give me a great. Give me a break. \nSo the last person she wants to run against is me. \nI said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. You don\u2019t understand. If I don\u2019t win, I will consider this \u2013 and I mean this \u2013 a total and complete waste of time. I really do.\u201d \nSo because we\u2019re not going to do anything. It\u2019s wonderful...If we don\u2019t win, to me, and honestly you should feel the same thing, if we don\u2019t win it\u2019s a total waste of time because you have somebody else in there, they won\u2019t be able to do what I do. They\u2019re not going to be able to \u2013 and even if you get one of these Republicans in... \nLike the wall. When I say Mexico is going to pay, they all laughed. They all go \u201cHehehe.\u201d They think it\u2019s funny. Honestly. These are people. They think it\u2019s funny. They\u2019re laughing. You know, lightly like \u201cOh ho, that\u2019s so funny. Hahaha.\u201d \nThey need to pay for the walls, folks. They\u2019re making billions and billions and billions of dollars on deficits that we have with Mexico. The wall is peanuts. They\u2019ve got to pay for the wall. \n...And then the other day...it was Ted Cruz, who\u2019s a nice guy, but he said \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a wall at the southern border.\u201d I said, \u201cWhoa.\u201d And my wife is sitting. \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d Right? No. Ted\u2019s a good guy. But he said...I think it was on Fox. He was being interviewed and he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a wall at the southern border.\u201d He didn\u2019t say Mexico is going to pay. He hasn\u2019t gotten that far yet but believe me that\u2019s going to happen. \nSee, they\u2019re all trying to catch up with me because when I did this stuff it was very out there. Now I\u2019m the one that everybody wants to sort of aspire to. \nBut what happens is \u2013 so Ted\u2019s up and he\u2019s talking and...\u201dWe\u2019re going to build a wall.\u201d My wife is sitting there and she says \u201cDarling, did you hear that? He just said they\u2019re going to build a wall. That\u2019s the first time \u2013 you know, that\u2019s what you say!\u201d She hasn\u2019t heard that from any other candidate. \nOkay, so we\u2019re going to build a wall. Mexico is going to pay for it. \nThere is so many things that we\u2019re going to do. But when I started the journey, it was amazing. I came down. It took courage. I went down into the lobby of Trump Tower on the escalator with Melania. I have never seen \u2013 it looked like the Academy Awards. The press. We have a lot of press here today. All live. Look at all those live cameras. \nSo, when I came down in the escalator, we came down and I said we\u2019re going to do things and I mentioned illegal immigration. You wouldn\u2019t even be talking about illegal \u2013 it wasn\u2019t even on the radar. Nobody was talking about illegal immigration. Is that right? Now it\u2019s one of the big subjects. \nAnd that\u2019s why and one of the beautiful polls that came out and I\u2019m so proud of it. CNN just came out with a poll a couple of weeks ago, 37% for Trump, second is 16%, third is 14%, then 12%. So they\u2019re way down. But on the economy, 55%. That\u2019s with 16 people at the time. \nOn the budget, I mean, I understand the budget, the economy, I win it hands down. All right. But listen to this. On illegal immigration, I\u2019m almost at 50%. And on ISIS likewise almost at 50%. \nSo, people want to be protected. They want to feel safe. They need strength. They need toughness. They need smarts. \nI don\u2019t want to be tough. You know, I know a lot of tough guys but they\u2019re not smart and they\u2019re the easiest. You can be tough. You\u2019ve got to be smart. Let\u2019s start smart first. You\u2019ve got to be smart, tough. You\u2019ve got to be tough. Because the world is trying to take advantage of us. \nSo what happens is this. I came out, I started. I did it \u2013 I was, oh, that first couple of weeks with illegal immigration and Mexico and all of the stuff. \nThen Kate was killed in San Francisco and Jamiel was killed in Los Angeles. Jamiel Shaw \u2013 an unbelievable young man \u2013 was killed, just shot right through the head by an illegal immigrant. Kate was shot by a guy who came in five or six times, shot in the back. So many great people. These are two. So many. And then you have the economy and the jobs that are being lost and people aren\u2019t paying taxes and all of this stuff. Right? \nAnd all of a sudden, people are coming over and I\u2019d say the wall and now they\u2019re starting to say the wall. We have to be progressive in our thinking. \nWhen I say progressive, I mean like smart. I\u2019m not talking progressive like Bernie Sanders would say. This guy wants to tax you. Think of it. Think of it. This guy wants to raise your taxes to 90%. No, no. You have to move out of this. \nI love this area by the way. I\u2019ve been here many times. Great golfing area. Right? We love it. No more golf if Bernie Sanders \u2013 no more golf. No, no. You won\u2019t have any golf anymore. You won\u2019t have any money left to be golfing. You\u2019ll be paying it in taxes. This guy is a total disaster. \nSo, when the people up on the stage with me and Hillary \u2013 Hillary doesn\u2019t have a clue. By the way, you talk about low energy? She has lower energy than Jeb Bush, which is hard to believe. She does! \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you and I\u2019ve been saying it and maybe it\u2019s rude. Maybe it\u2019s rude. Maybe it\u2019s not. But it doesn\u2019t matter. We have a much bigger problem. We have to save our country. \nSo if I\u2019m rude or if people think I\u2019m rude and if people think I\u2019m rude, I\u2019m actually a nice person. I have a big heart. I want to help people. \nI want to help the migration. I want to do a safe zone in Syria. I don\u2019t want them coming here. We don\u2019t know who these people are. They\u2019re undocumented. They\u2019re undocumented. And we should do a safe zone over there. \nWe should have the Gulf states \u2013 Saudi Arabia \u2013 these states, they\u2019re not spending. They\u2019ve got to spend. They\u2019ve got to pay. \nYou know, we\u2019re protecting them. They won\u2019t be there for two minutes if we\u2019re not protecting them. They\u2019ve got to start paying. They\u2019re not taking anybody. Okay? \nHow about Germany taking millions \u2013 can you believe what she\u2019s doing to that country? And she was the person of the year and I wasn\u2019t. Everybody said Trump was supposed \u2013 what are you going to do? I think she\u2019s made a terrible mistake. We\u2019ll find out. Time will tell. They\u2019re having tremendous crime problems. I think she\u2019s made a terrible mistake. \nBut what I like is in Syria with other people\u2019s money meaning the Gulf states and others and Germany and others because look Germany is paying a fortune to accept all these people. They\u2019ll give us the money. We\u2019d do a massive safe zone. And then eventually when this whole catastrophe straightens out, which I\u2019ll probably be able to get it straightened out. I understand that stuff. But once it\u2019s straightened out, they can go back home to their country. You know, to their area. \nIt\u2019s interesting. I have thousands of people who work for me. Thousands. And they\u2019re people that come from far \u2013 they\u2019re all here legally. Don\u2019t worry about it. I use e-verify. But I have people \u2013 oh, they go and check. These guys go check. They went into the Old Post Office, checking everybody. \u201cAre you here illegally? Are you here illegally?\u201d \nThey said they found one person out of hundreds of hundreds and hundreds. I don\u2019t believe it. Okay? I don\u2019t believe it. \nBut you know, it\u2019s possible. We do have 11 million people in the country and it\u2019s probably a much higher number than that. Okay? It\u2019s probably a much higher number. \nBut we have to do something about it and we\u2019re going to do. \nSo I just want to finish by saying, look, we have the situation that\u2019s out of control. Our country is a dumping ground for the rest of the world. We\u2019re laughed at by the rest of the world. \nAnd when I started this journey and it\u2019s a journey and I do love you people and you\u2019re amazing people. \nAnd by the way, you\u2019re so smart. You know, a lot of times they\u2019ll say, \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s people are blue collar.\u201d I love blue collar. I\u2019m honored by that. But they\u2019re not blue collar. I mean, we have blue collar. We have executives. And we have young people. \nThey said the audience is older. It\u2019s not older. The audience is young. \nThe other night in Iowa, I told that and I said we have so many young people and the place erupted. They\u2019re all young people. We have an amazing thing happening. It\u2019s just \u2013 look, that\u2019s their way of marginalizing not even me. It\u2019s their way of marginalizing you. It\u2019s disgusting. \nBut when I started this journey and it\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s a journey and it\u2019s a movement that\u2019s taking place. It\u2019s a movement. \nRemember the old days? Silent majority? It\u2019s not right. It\u2019s a noisy majority. People are angry. It\u2019s a noisy majority. These aren\u2019t silent people anymore. I got to people you can\u2019t even hear. \nThis is an amazing thing that\u2019s happened. \nI received a call from one of the biggest reporters who happens to be liberal but that\u2019s okay. We can have a couple of them. Right? But a guy who\u2019s really respected. Recently. And he said, \u201cHow does it feel?\u201d I said \u201cHow does what feel?\u201d He said, \u201cWhat you have done has never been done in the history of politics in the United States.\u201d \nI mean, even CNN said number one political story of the year was Trump. You know what number two was? ISIS. ISIS was two. I\u2019d rather reverse it. Let ISIS be one, let me be two because I want to knock the hell out of them and make me number one next year. Make me number one next year. \nBut this reporter, who\u2019s a great intellect actually and a very smart guy and very good guy. He said, \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done has never been done before in the history of this country.\u201d \nNewt Gingrich was on a television show the other day and said this is one of the great phenomenons I\u2019ve seen in politics. Nobody has ever seen it because crowds like this \u2013 forget it...It\u2019s unbelievable what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s beautiful what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s beautiful what\u2019s happening. \nBut Newt Gingrich said he\u2019s never seen anything like this. But he said to me, the reporter, said never been done before. I said, \u201cWell, you know, it\u2019s fine. But if I don\u2019t win, it\u2019s just a waste of time.\u201d He goes, \u201cNo, no, no. What you\u2019ve done is incredible.\u201d He said, \u201cEven if you don\u2019t win, what you\u2019ve done is incredible. You\u2019ve totally changed the landscape of politics.\u201d \nNo, don\u2019t applaud. Don\u2019t applaud. Don\u2019t applaud. He said, \u201cYou\u2019ve totally changed the landscape of politics. It\u2019s forever going to be different. Your campaign \u2013 there\u2019s never anything like it.\u201d \nBut here\u2019s the story. We\u2019ve got to build a wall. \nSo when I talk and when I\u2019m up on the stage with these guys, these people, wonderful people and a very nice woman, Carly, she\u2019s a nice woman. When I\u2019m up on the stage with them, they think I\u2019m crazy when I say Mexico. I would say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a wall. It\u2019s going to be a great wall. It\u2019s going to be a real wall.\u201d See this ceiling? This ceiling is peanuts compared to the height of the wall I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m talking about if they ever get up there, they\u2019re not coming down because it\u2019s too dangerous. All right? \nDo you ever see what they do now? We have these little walls. They build ramps. They built a ramp. I said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cheaper just to knock the wall down?\u201d And then they drive over it with Jeeps loaded up with drugs. Did you see this? They build ramps. It was a picture in Time Magazine. It\u2019s a ramp. A little ramp that goes over the wall. So they have a Jeep over down, boom, make money. We get the drugs. \n...You\u2019ve got to build a wall. We get the drugs. They get the cash. Not so good. Right? We don\u2019t like that deal. Our politicians don\u2019t know. They don\u2019t know. \nSo when I say Mexico is going to pay for it. These guys on the stage. They\u2019re not business people. They don\u2019t understand. Mexico makes a fortune off the United States. \nNumber one, we give them a lot of money. But in addition to that, they\u2019re taking our businesses. They\u2019re making \u2013 you talk about a trade deficit. I\u2019ll tell you what, Mexico in a certain way is a mini version the new China. Mexico is making an absolute fortune. Peanuts compared to the cost of the wall. Let\u2019s say the cost of the wall is $10 billion. That\u2019s a good. I think I can do a great job for $10 billion. I think we\u2019ll have a lot of money left over. \n...And by the way, 20 years ago they wanted to build a wall. People that are opposed to it now they wanted it to stop and they wanted to build the wall. You know one of the reasons they didn\u2019t build the wall? Because of the environmental protection agency. They couldn\u2019t get an environmental impact study approved. Can you believe it? Because there was a toad, a turtle or a snake or something was in the way. \nNow, think of it, in China, in the South China Sea, there were these low level land masses that were covered by water but pretty close to the top. China sends in massive excavators...They\u2019re building military fortresses in the South China Sea. \nAnd a friend of mine who\u2019s one of the biggest and richest people in China \u2013 he\u2019s a great guy. They\u2019re great people. They\u2019re fine. They\u2019re just too smart. I mean, their leaders are too smart for our people. They won\u2019t be too smart when I put my people there. \nWhen they call up, \u201cWe\u2019d like to speak to the donor that is negotiating.\u201d No, no, the donor now is Carl Icahn. You can just speak to Carl Icahn. You know, Carl. Great businessman. You have so many people. They call all these businesspeople call. \nSo a friend of mine \u2013 so I call and I say, \u201cYou\u2019re actually doing that.\u201d And then jokingly, I asked, \u201cHow long did it take to get started? Did you have to get an environmental impact study approved in order to excavate?\u201d He looked at me and he goes \u201cI hope you\u2019re kidding when you say that.\u201d They conceived of the idea. They started digging four hours later. Okay? There\u2019s no \u2013 go through 25 years of environmental impact. You\u2019re going to hurt the snail. You\u2019re going to hurt this. You\u2019re going to \u2013 \nThey\u2019re doing a big thing. They excavated massive, massive, take a look. Massive \u2013 the biggest excavator. They\u2019re ripping the hell out of that ocean. They\u2019re ripping it and they\u2019re taking that dirt and they\u2019re putting it and they\u2019re building air fields and they\u2019re building forts. \nWe couldn\u2019t do it because just like I said for the wall. Legitimately, they couldn\u2019t get an environmental impact statement. Now, that\u2019s probably not the only reason it didn\u2019t happen. I heard their costs were too high. \nWith me, that\u2019s easy. You know, I\u2019m doing the Old Post Office in Washington. I\u2019m under-budget. I\u2019m ahead of schedule. \nHey, look at the campaign. Guys at $59 million and he\u2019s down at the bottom. I\u2019m nothing and I\u2019m at the top. It\u2019s the same thing. \nI actually said \u2013 it\u2019s funny. The other day, I got this great review. They said \u201cTrump is a great speaker. The crowd is spellbound. But he has one problem.\u201d I\u2019m reading. I want to see. \u201cThe problem is he speaks through the applause.\u201d In other words, I say that, you applaud, I start talking before you finish your applause. And you know why? Because I\u2019m so excited because we have so much potential. It\u2019s true. I don\u2019t want to wait for your freaking applause. We have \u2013 I have so many. We have so much potential. There\u2019s so many things to do. I don\u2019t really sort of want to wait. I want to do it. \nAnd I just noticed. You did it again. You were getting ready to get a big applause because you like that and I\u2019m speaking. I killed the applause. He\u2019s right. Except I\u2019m not a speaker; what I am is a doer. I get things done. I get things done. \nBut think of it. So Obama is talking about all of this with the global warming and that. A lot of it is a hoax. It\u2019s a hoax. I mean, it\u2019s a money making industry, okay? It\u2019s a hoax. A lot of them. \nLook, I want clean air and I want clean water. That\u2019s my global \u2013 I want clean, clean crystal water. And I want clean air. And we can do that. \nBut we don\u2019t have to destroy our businesses... \nAnd by the way, China isn\u2019t abiding by anything. They\u2019re buying all of our coal. We can\u2019t use coal anymore essentially. They\u2019re buying our coal and they\u2019re using it. \nNow, when you talk about the planet, it\u2019s so big out there. We\u2019re here. They\u2019re there. It\u2019s like they\u2019re our next door neighbor. Right? In terms of the universe. \nMiss Universe, by the way, made a great deal when I sold it. Oh, did I get rich. That was a great deal. You know, they broke my choppers on that. They said \u201cHe talks about illegal immigration. We\u2019re not going to put him on television.\u201d First of all, Univision is being sued like crazy. You wouldn\u2019t believe it. And NBC I made a great deal with them. Just like an amazing deal. Far more than it would have ever gotten. I made an unbelievable deal. Far more than I ever would have gotten if I said \u201cI think I\u2019m going to sell it if times were normal.\u201d Isn\u2019t it amazing the way this stuff could work out? But I love Miss Universe and I love the universe. \nBut think of it. So, China is spewing up all this stuff and we\u2019re holding back. And with China, you know, we sign these agreements where we have to do it now. They have to do it within 30 or 35 years. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be doing it. \nIt\u2019s like Japan. If somebody attacks Japan, we have to immediately go and start World War III. Okay? If we get attacked, Japan doesn\u2019t have to help us. Somehow that doesn\u2019t sound so fair. Right? Does that sound good? \nSo, South Korea. I ordered televisions. I ordered thousands of televisions a year. I order televisions because I have a lot of stuff. I like nice brands. They\u2019re all made in South Korea. Most \u2013 other than Sony. And Sony in all fairness has lost its way. \nBut a lot of them \u2013 Samsung \u2013 all of them. I mean, they\u2019re all pretty much \u2013 all of them, right? I think just about. But I ordered thousands of televisions. They\u2019re all from South Korea. \nSo we have 28,000 people on the border separating South Korea from this maniac in North Korea. We get nothing. What do we get? Nothing? They\u2019re making a fortune. It\u2019s an economic behemoth. \nA lot that you don\u2019t know. We protect Germany. Germany. Mercedes Benz. How many people have a Mercedes Benz? We protect Germany. It\u2019s an economic behemoth. \nWe protect Saudi Arabia. They were during the good oil days \u2013 now it\u2019s probably half, which is fine. But during the good oil days, they were making $1 billion a day. And we protect them. Our military protects them. They pay us peanuts, not like nothing. \nAnd then if we want to buy, if we want to move to another location, \u201cWell, that\u2019s very expensive if we do that.\u201d Charges us rent? \nI mean, look, we are run by people that are so bad. They\u2019re so out of their league. And I see it. I see it on this stage. A lot of them are nice people. You know, a lot of people think I don\u2019t like these guys. I do like them. \n...They don\u2019t have business sense and business ability. They don\u2019t have common sense. They\u2019re politicians. They\u2019re all talk. They\u2019re no action. \nWhen I say \u2013 folks, when I say we\u2019re going to build a wall, most of them say \u201cYou can\u2019t build a wall\u201d. We\u2019ll build a wall. \nIn China, 2000 years ago, they built the Great Wall of China, which is bigger than any wall we\u2019re thinking about. Okay? The Great Wall of China goes 18,000 miles. We have 2,000 miles of which we really only need 1,000 miles because you have a lot of natural barriers that are extremely tough to get across. \nWe have 1,000 miles. So China has 18,000 or 13,000 miles. And we have 1,000 miles. \nWe have modern cranes. We have Caterpillar tractors. I want to use Caterpillar. I don\u2019t want to use Komatsu. Made in America! \nEven my hats are made in America. It wasn\u2019t easy to find a guy to do those hats. You know what I\u2019m talking about. I see so many knock-offs of my hat. Right? Make America Great Again. I see these things. They\u2019re out of plastic. They\u2019re out of all sorts of crap. Mine are made in America and honestly they do a great job but they don\u2019t produce as much as I\u2019d like because frankly there\u2019s a big \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s amazing. Those hats are amazing. But I wanted to have it made \u2013 and you know why I wanted to have it made \u2013 I wanted it anyway. \nBut I also knew that as soon as the hats came out and other things \u2013 as soon as the hats came out, I knew the press would be calling. And it\u2019s true. First hour when the hats were announced, I get a call from the New York Times. \u201cMr. Trump, where were those hats made?\u201d I said, \u201cAmerica.\u201d I knew it. I knew it. \nBecause as you know if I would have said China, I would have been in big, big trouble. \nBut they\u2019re being knocked off all over the world. I mean, I see hats \u2013 they\u2019re like helmets. I see them all. But what are you going to do? \nOkay? You think their wives don\u2019t know what they\u2019re planning? You think their kids don\u2019t know exactly what daddy\u2019s doing when daddy\u2019s going to fly into the World Trade Center. You think they don\u2019t know? They know exactly what\u2019s going on. Remember that. \nAnd frankly, I think they have more love for their family\u2019s lives than they do for their own life. Okay? \nBut they still want to live. \nSo here\u2019s Obama \u2013 gives an exact date. He gives an exact date. So they pulled back. And everyone says, \u201cOh, we\u2019re doing so well. Look, we\u2019re doing so well.\u201d \nThe enemy \u2013 why should they fight when they know in 18 months they can go and take the place. \nSo what happens? So we have ISIS taking a lot of the oil. I said, \u201cTake the oil.\u201d Remember, when we left \u2013 I was opposed going in because I said you\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East because you had Iraq and you had Iran. And I said, they\u2019ll fight. They\u2019re always fighting, for decades and decades, for generations. They fight. That\u2019s what they do. They fight. \nHow we ever got involved in this mess is hard to believe. \nThey fight. And they were equal militarily. They go this way 10 feet. They go this way 10 feet. Then they rest a couple of years. Then they start fighting again. \nThen Saddam Hussein throws a little gas. Everyone goes crazy. \u201cOh, he\u2019s using gas.\u201d They go back and forth. It\u2019s the same. And they were stabilized. \nAnd I said, \u201cIf you go after one or the other, in this case Iraq, you\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East. It\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. You\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what happened. We totally destabilized the Middle East. \nWe have now migrations largely because of what\u2019s happened afterwards. \nYou know, Iraq was horrible. It was stupid to go in. We should have never gotten in. But we shouldn\u2019t have gone out the way we went out. And we shouldn\u2019t have given dates. \nI mean, I would have probably said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay forever\u201d and they would have said, \u201cOh man, keep going, keep going\u201d and eventually they would get tired. They\u2019d say, \u201cThis guy\u2019s crazy. I mean, he\u2019s never going to leave\u201d and you\u2019ll make a deal. \nBut when you\u2019re announcing you\u2019re leaving in 18 months or whatever the hell he said, they\u2019d just pull back and as soon as we left, they come in. Okay? \nSo they have the oil. You know who the biggest beneficiary of the oil is? Right? China. China. Always China. \nI love China. I love Mexico. Their leaders are too smart for us. \nWe have no border. We will build a wall. Mexico will pay for the wall. We\u2019re going to build a wall. We\u2019re going to have a border. And people are going to come into our country but they\u2019re going to come in through a legal process. They\u2019re not coming in the way they\u2019re coming in now. Just walking in like nothing. They\u2019re going to come in but they\u2019re going to come through a legal process. \nSo with Iraq, so we give them a date and they take over. We didn\u2019t take the oil. \nSo for four years, I\u2019ve been talking about it. Then because of Paris all of a sudden they started bombing the oil. \nBut I didn\u2019t want to just bomb the oil. I want to take the oil. They\u2019re bombing. You know, we\u2019re bombing. Great. What\u2019s going to happen after that? So we\u2019re bombing. \nAnd you know, we\u2019re not really bombing it because they\u2019re still selling it. I said, \u201cHow can they keep selling it?\u201d \u201cObama doesn\u2019t want to hit him too hard because he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to pollute the atmosphere.\u201d \nNo, this is serious. \nNow, think of it. He talks about the carbon...and yet he\u2019ll fly a very old Air Force One \u2013 an old Boeing 747 with the old engines, you know, spewing stuff. \nSo he\u2019s got a problem with the carbon footprint. You can\u2019t use hairspray because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. \nLet\u2019s see. I\u2019m in my room in New York City and I want to put a little spray so that I could...Right? But I hear where they don\u2019t want me to use the hairspray. They want me to use the pump because the other one, which I really like better than going bing, bing, bing, and then it comes out in big globs, right? And then you\u2019re stuck in your hair and you say, \u201cOh my God, I have to take a shower again. My hair\u2019s all screwed up.\u201d Right? \nI want to use hairspray. They say, \u201cDon\u2019t use hairspray. It\u2019s bad for the ozone.\u201d \nSo I\u2019m sitting in this concealed apartment, this concealed unit. You know, I really do live in a very nice apartment. Right? But it\u2019s sealed. It\u2019s beautiful. I don\u2019t think anything gets out and I\u2019m not supposed to be using hairspray. \nBut think of it. So Obama is always talking about the global warming, that global warming in our biggest and most dangerous problem. Okay? \nNo, no, think of it. I mean, even if you\u2019re a believer in global warming, ISIS is a big problem. Russia is a problem. China is a problem. We\u2019ve got a lot of problems. \nBy the way, the maniac in North Korea is a problem. He actually has nuclear weapons. Right? That\u2019s a problem. \nWe\u2019ve got a lot of problems. We\u2019ve got a lot of problems. That\u2019s right. We don\u2019t win anymore. He said, \u201cWe want to win.\u201d We don\u2019t win anymore. We\u2019re going to win a lot. If I get a elected, we\u2019re going to win a lot. We\u2019re going to win so much. We\u2019re going to win a lot. We\u2019re going to win a lot. We\u2019re going to win so much you\u2019re all going to get sick and tired of winning. You\u2019d say, \u201cOh no, not again.\u201d I\u2019m only kidding. You never get tired of winning. Right? \nWe made a deal for Iran done by some of the dumbest people on Earth on our side. We gave them everything. We don\u2019t even get our prisoners back. And now Iran wants to start negotiating separately for them. Can you believe it? I go crazy. We would\u2019ve gotten them back. \nAll you have to do is say, \u201cWe want our prisoners back.\u201d \nThey would have said no. I would\u2019ve said \u201cI want them back. You don\u2019t understand me. I want them back.\u201d They would have said \u201cNo, we won\u2019t do that.\u201d I would\u2019ve said \u201cBye bye\u201d and I would have left. Then I would have doubled up the sanctions and I guarantee you \u2013 I guarantee you that within 24 hours they would\u2019ve called back and they\u2019ll say \u201cYou\u2019ve got your prisoners. Can we talk?\u201d \nAnd I would have never given them $150 billion. I would have never given them the money...They don\u2019t have to make nuclear. They can buy it. Why do they have to make it? \nThen we have the nuclear where they self-inspection. How about the area \u2013 the big area \u2013 they don\u2019t want us there. Oh, I wonder why. They don\u2019t want us there. So they self-inspect. Okay? \nThen they have the 24 day inspection. \nBut the self-inspection is the beauty. \u201cWe think you\u2019re making nuclear weapons here.\u201d \u201cWell, let us go check, Mr. President. We\u2019ll check. No, sir, we\u2019re not making nuclear weapons. Nobody...no, we would never do a thing like that.\u201d \nThese are people that have deceived us. They have lied to us. They are a terrorist state. \nBut \u2013 and I used to say it\u2019s the worst deal that I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated. \nAnd by the way, just to finish \u2013 prisoners. So they come back, we get our prisoners. But then when I hear the other day that now this deal\u2019s done. It\u2019s all done. And now I hear they want to negotiate to get \u2013 and what did they say? They said very strongly they said \u201cWe are going to want a lot for the prisoners. We\u2019re starting off. We\u2019re going to want a lot.\u201d \nNow, we\u2019ve already taken off the sanctions. They\u2019re already rich as hell. What\u2019s going on there? \nThat\u2019s why I say, I mean, some people say it\u2019s worse than stupidity. There\u2019s something going on that we don\u2019t know about. I mean, honestly. \nAnd you\u2019re almost thinking \u2013 I\u2019m not saying that and I\u2019m not a conspiracy person...I\u2019m just hoping they\u2019re just stupid people. Okay? Which they are. Or there\u2019s something going on because it\u2019s inconceivable. \nYou know, do you ever see something that are so bad that it can\u2019t be? That nobody can do what they did. Right? Nobody. \nSo, Iran now wants to negotiate separately for the \u2013 in other words, that deal is done and now we want to start a whole new deal. And they want a lot. \u201cWe want a lot.\u201d \nAnd I just \u2013 I want to just shoot the television, you know? Because they would have had it just for saying. \nAnd you know when they ask Kerry and Obama \u2013 the deal was made. Everybody knows it\u2019s a horrible deal. It\u2019s going to lead to tremendous nuclear proliferation. And they\u2019re so rich now. You know, they became $150 billion \u2013 they became so rich. \nAnd many other things that you don\u2019t even know about. Most people don\u2019t even know what the agreement says. \nBut I\u2019ll tell you what, when you look at what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re not going to have \u2013 if we keep going like this, folks, we\u2019re not going to have a country left. We\u2019re not going to have a country. We\u2019re not going to have our country. \nAnd we\u2019re like a dumping ground for the world. We\u2019re a dumping... \nOkay, so Gaddafi, they backed rebels who end up killing the Ambassador and the other young people. You know, the Ambassador was riding in a Jeep. One of our Jeeps, of course. A military Jeep, holding the Libyan flag, and you know, \u201cFreedom! Freedom! Freedom!\u201d and then he gets killed by the same people. \nSo we backed people that turned out to be far worse than Gaddafi. Look at what we did in Iraq. Look at what we did in Iraq. \nI mean, what the hell did we get? We spent $2 trillion. And that was as of 1.5 years ago. I keep saying $2 trillion. It\u2019s a lot more than that. We spent $2 trillion. We have thousands of deaths. And I\u2019m not even talking other side. You\u2019re talking about other side you\u2019re talking about hundreds of thousands \u2013 maybe millions. \nYou have thousands of deaths. We have wounded warriors who I love. These guys are the toughest. These are the greatest people. Now, these are the greatest people. \nAnd then what happens? We leave. And we have a president that announces the date of when we\u2019re leaving. \nSo I said, \u201cMan, if I\u2019m the enemy, I\u2019m just going to go away for 18 months.\u201d Right? And he gave a date. \u201cWe are leaving Iraq. We will be gone by such and such a time.\u201d \nI\u2019m just sitting there watching and I\u2019m saying, \u201cMan, that\u2019s really stupid.\u201d Because believe me, the enemy doesn\u2019t want to be killed. You know, you hear so much \u2013 \u201cOh, they want to go with the virgins up to wherever they go.\u201d Right? They don\u2019t want that. They want to live. They want to live. And they want to take care of their families. Always their families. Remember that. Because their families know what\u2019s going on. Okay? \nOne thing about education \u2013 so in the world, we are ranked number 28. There are third world countries that are ranked better than us in education and many other things. \nAnd yet, per pupil, we are number one by far. There\u2019s nobody close. Number two isn\u2019t even close. So we spend more money per pupil than any country in the world and we\u2019re ranked number 28, which is way down, way down the bottom essentially. \nCan you imagine? We\u2019re ranked number 28. We\u2019re number one. \nAnd that\u2019s what I do like saying about my campaign. I spend less money than anybody else and I have the best result. I\u2019m number one by a lot and I spend no money. I mean, my plane costs me some money but I spend no ads. Took a little radio ad in Iowa. But I didn\u2019t do that. I think the station is so lovely if you want to know the truth. But I spend essentially no money and then you have all these other guys spending vast \u2013 and they\u2019re like the way the United States is run. \nNow why would we put a guy like Jeb, like some of the others \u2013 it\u2019s not only Jeb Bush \u2013 they spend money. \nI see Rubio the ads all day long. You know, the black background. He\u2019s got like a black thing...No, no. And I like him. I think he\u2019s a nice guy. But I see these ads, you know, with the backdrops and it\u2019s just somber. It\u2019s not good. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good. \nSo figuring I spend no money and I\u2019m number one. Others spend \u2013 they will have spent hundreds of millions of dollars and they\u2019re not even in the race. That\u2019s what we need for our country. \n...You know, the only time the cameras focus on the crowd is when we have a protester. Because I always have \u2013 look at this ballroom \u2013 packed. I always have the biggest crowds. And I go home and my wife said, \u201cWere there many people? I watched you on television tonight.\u201d I said, \u201cI had 20,000 people \u2013 the whole arena.\u201d She said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t show it. They have it right on your face.\u201d \nSo I have 20,000 people. I had 20,000 in Oklahoma, 35,000 in Mobile, Alabama, nobody knows because those cameras they run in your face. And I think they can\u2019t move. I think they\u2019re maybe fixed because modern cameras maybe \u2013 except every time there\u2019s a guy who stands up protesting, you know, they\u2019re on drugs or something because some of these guys they don\u2019t even know what the hell they\u2019re doing there, all of the sudden the cameras swerve and they\u2019re perfect shots. And I like it because then it shows how big the crowds are. So you know, sometimes I think I\u2019m going to put in some false protesters. I\u2019ll put in some friendly protesters. It\u2019s the only way I\u2019m going to be able to get them to \u2013 \nSo when we started, I talked about trade. I talked about the border. I talked about a lot of things. And I started on June 16th and in Trump Tower, the famous escalator ride. And it takes guts to run for president, I\u2019ll tell you. You know, it\u2019s like I never did this before. \nAnd then...the debate. We had the largest debate. We had the largest audience in the history of cable television. \nThen CNN a couple of weeks later had 23 million. Fox had 24 million. CNN had 23 million. The largest audience in the history of CNN. Now, they\u2019re there, the cameras are live right now. You know, the largest audience in the history of CNN. \nNow the debates used to be \u2013 you go back four years or eight years, you know whenever the cycles came up, nobody even wanted it \u2013 they didn\u2019t want the debates. I think they were forced to take them for licensing. Nobody wanted the debates...But now they\u2019re drawing 24 million. Now they want to have more debates. \u201cOh, can we have more? Can we have more? Can they go three hours?\u201d Remember? When they had the one go three hours? I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not doing three hours. It\u2019s too long.\u201d Who wants \u2013 I could stand up here for 50 hours but who the hell wants to sit home watching three hours of this stuff? Right? \n\u201cMr. Trump, you have 30 seconds. What would you do about ISIS?\u201d Oh great, thanks. \nAnd by the way, that question \u2013 I hate those questions. You know why? Because I want to be unpredictable. I don\u2019t want to tell ISIS what I\u2019m going to do to knock the hell out of them. I hate it. I hate it. \nRemember, I said very strongly...for four years...\u201dGet the oil. Get the oil. Get the oil.\u201d Because who\u2019s going to get the oil? Iran is taking over Iraq. \nAnd you know who really don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you who does not like...Yeah, we\u2019ll get Ivanka. Let\u2019s do Ivanka. \nBut I\u2019ll tell you who doesn\u2019t like Hillary are women. Women don\u2019t like Hillary. I see it all the time. \nAnd always so theatrical. \u201cMr. Trump said this and that and this.\u201d Ugh. And you just \u2013 I actually \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t do it. I just have to turn off the television so many times. She just gives me a headache. \nBut you know, although I think last night I gave her a big headache. I could imagine. I could imagine those discussions. \nBut you have to hit back hard and you can\u2019t let them push you around. And today she gave a speech and she never even mentioned my name. \nYou know the debate I was mentioned nine times. I mean, everything through all of them but her. I was mentioned nine times. None of the other candidates were mentioned. \nAnd then she came out with the sexism, which is so nonsense. But she\u2019s playing that card and then I had to hit her back. So I hit her back and I talked about her husband and the abuse of women and the tremendous abuse. No, it\u2019s tremendous abuse. I mean you look at it. It\u2019s tremendous abuse and I talked about that. \nAnd now, today the television is going crazy. And she gets up, makes a speech that doesn\u2019t even mention anything about me with sexism or anything else? I wonder why. I wonder why. \nAnd remember this. It\u2019s really important. A poll just came out where we\u2019re tied. Another one came out a couple of weeks ago \u2013 Fox \u2013 where I\u2019m leading by 4 or 5 points against her individually. We\u2019re doing great. I haven\u2019t even focused on her yet. \nLook at the people I focused on. I don\u2019t want to really knock them. I don\u2019t want to mention their names. But you know, of all the people that were all gone, they were all people that attacked me. \nWouldn\u2019t be nice if our country could have that same thing? You attack and they\u2019re \u2013 poom \u2013 gone. And if we could do it verbally, you know, if we could do it verbally that\u2019s even better. Right? \nYou know, who wants to use our military? By the way, we are going to build the strongest, the best, the most powerful military ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. \nAnd we\u2019re going to take care of our vets. We\u2019re going to take care of our vets. Because they are being treated horribly. \nBut we\u2019re going to build the strongest, most powerful military ever \u2013 let me just tell you, let me just tell you a little secret. It\u2019s the cheapest thing we can do. We\u2019re never going to have to use it. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have to use it. \nDon\u2019t forget. They talk about my tone. I remember when Jeb and Hillary the same day \u2013 \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s tone is not nice.\u201d They\u2019re chopping off Christians\u2019 heads in Syria and other place, and they want me to have a nice tone. I\u2019m supposed to be always \u2013 isn\u2019t life wonderful? Okay? \nLook, we\u2019ve got to be tough. We\u2019ve got to be smart. We\u2019ve got to have heart too. We\u2019ve got to have heart. We\u2019ve got to take care of people. \nWe\u2019ve got to fix our health care program. This Obamacare is a disaster. You people know. You people know...It\u2019s going to be repealed and replaced. It will die in \u201917 anyways. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard what\u2019s happening but it\u2019s so bad all the people that they didn\u2019t think were signing up are signing up and the other people that are really paying for it aren\u2019t signing up. And your rates are going up 25%, 35%, 45%. Your deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by a tractor, you\u2019re never going to be able to use your deductible. You\u2019re never going to be able to use it. \nSo Obamacare is a disaster. We\u2019re going to repeal it. We\u2019re going to replace it. There\u2019s so many great things we can do on health care. So many great things. \nAnd it\u2019ll cost you much less money and it\u2019ll be great. It\u2019ll be great. \nI mean, you\u2019re signing into programs and things that you\u2019ll never ever use. You know that. And you\u2019re paying for it and you\u2019ll never ever use them. So we\u2019ll get that straighten out. \nWe\u2019re going to straighten out a lot of things. We\u2019re going to straighten out Common Core. Common Core is dead. It\u2019s going to be dead. It\u2019s going to be dead. \nWhen I look at parents and I see local parents in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina \u2013 I went to a school and I saw the parents, they love their children. They want to educate \u2013 they love \u2013 they don\u2019t care about money. They don\u2019t care about anything. They love their children. And it\u2019s local. And they get together and they do wonderful programs. They\u2019re smart people. As opposed to getting it done by bureaucrats that are getting big fat checks in Washington. I mean, we have such talent in this country and we don\u2019t use it. \nSo Obamacare \u2013 dead. Common Core \u2013 gone. We\u2019re going to get rid of it. Department of Education \u2013 we\u2019re going to get rid of it. We\u2019re bringing education to a local level. \n\u201cYou started off here right next to me. And then you were there, then you were there. By the next time, you\u2019re going to be off the stage.\u201d \nNo, no, it\u2019s true. \nAnd then that was it. I responded. So he asked me a question. The question was fine. You know, professionally written. So he asked me a question. I give him an answer. I blow him away. Right? Everybody says Trump won the debate. Everybody. And that\u2019s it. \nAnd the ad is him asking the question and I\u2019m standing here like this because I haven\u2019t \u2013 in fact you see in one of them I\u2019m just about ready to open my mouth. But he doesn\u2019t let me respond. That\u2019s almost false advertising. Isn\u2019t it? \nSo I mentioned it. \nHillary is a disaster. I mean, Hillary \u2013 Hillary\u2019s controlled by her money. So is Jeb. By the way, I\u2019m the only one self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m self-funding. \nYou know, one of the things that makes me happy, I heard one of the commentators this morning said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been watching this stuff for 50 years. I\u2019ve never seen anything like what\u2019s happened with Trump.\u201d \n...I think low energy was a brutal statement. Right? And by the way, low energy can be applied to Hillary. I just don\u2019t like to use the same thing twice on one of my enemies. Right? Because I consider them enemies. We view this as war. Don\u2019t we view this as war? It\u2019s war. It\u2019s war. So you don\u2019t like to use it. I hate to give it up... \nSo here\u2019s the story. So we are in a situation where we have incompetent leadership, where our trade deals are killing us, our military is not prepared. Gen. Odierno when he left just recently he said we are less prepared now than at anytime that he can remember, and I think he went back to the beginning. But let\u2019s say Second World War. Okay? That\u2019s enough. \nNow we should be very prepared now because the world hates us. She has done a terrible job as Secretary of State. \nI mean, think of it. Putin comes out, he said, \u201cDonald Trump is brilliant. He\u2019s doing an amazing job and he\u2019s leading the pack.\u201d Okay. That\u2019s nice. \nAnd she and my opponents say \u201cOh, isn\u2019t that terrible that Putin said \u2013 \u201c Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we could get along with the world? Wouldn\u2019t it be? Seriously? No, no. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice? \nI mean, they want me to refuse his statement. \u201cHow dare you say I\u2019m brilliant.\u201d Who\u2019s going to do that? And by the way, if he said it about any one of them, they would have been very happy. \nBut the point is we have to get along. The world has blown up around Barack Obama. \nNow, I don\u2019t know if you saw his recent release. They were talking about the Department of State. State Department. And they said very strongly, you know, the things that they\u2019ve done. Well, they couldn\u2019t find it because what have they done that\u2019s good? And they said bringing peace to Syria. Did you see that? \nSo instead of saying they made a mistake, call it a typo, they made a mistake, they\u2019re trying to justify it. \u201cWell, we meant we\u2019re working on it.\u201d Can you believe? Bringing peace to Syria. The world is blowing up. The migration in Syria. They say one of their achievements of the year is bringing peace to Syria. And the whole world is talking about it. It\u2019s the level of stupidity is incredible. \nI\u2019m telling you. I used to use the word incompetent. Now, I just call them stupid. \nI went to an Ivy League school. I\u2019m very highly educated. I know words. I have the best words. I have the \u2013 but there\u2019s no better word than stupid. Right? There is none. There is none. There\u2019s no word like that. \nSo, we are going to turn things around. \nBut if we have Hillary, I\u2019ve got to tell you, I just saw where for the last week she\u2019s been hitting me really hard with the women card. Okay? Really hard. \nAnd I had to say, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough. That\u2019s enough.\u201d And we did a strong number. She\u2019s not going to win. \nAnd by the way, I love the concept \u2013 I love, love, love having a woman president. Can\u2019t be her. She\u2019s horrible. She\u2019s horrible. \nYou know last year, $500 billion trade deficit with China. $500 billion. You know what $500 billion is? You do hundred dollar bills and you fill the room to the ceiling. $500 billion deficit \u2013 trade deficit with China. \nWhat are we? I guess the answer is certainly let\u2019s not blame us. Our leaders are stupid and/or...they have deals. \nBecause what\u2019s happened is all of this money is being given to them by special interests, by all of these people including lobbyists. And these lobbyists make our leaders do \u2013 our leaders \u2013 can you believe this our leaders? But they make the leaders of our country do things that they don\u2019t even want to do because they\u2019ve given them tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars. \nWhen I look at this guy Jeb Bush, he spent $59 million on his campaign and he\u2019s down in the grave. He\u2019s nowhere. No, no, think of it. It\u2019s got to be much more than that. It was actually $59 million a while ago. \nEvery time I turn on an ad, I see an ad about Trump. I mean, it\u2019s not that bad an ad either. It\u2019s like \u2013 we\u2019ve got to do an ad, do an ad. \nLook, he\u2019s a low energy person. Let\u2019s face it. We don\u2019t need low energy. We need lots of energy. \nBut he\u2019s spent \u2013 think of it, think of it \u2013 he\u2019s spent $59 million. I spent nothing. Right? Nothing. \nNow, I\u2019m going to be spending. You probably saw it. We\u2019re going to start spending a lot of money because I don\u2019t want to take any chances...I love getting up and for the last couple of months, I\u2019ve been leading from practically the time I announced. Right? \nAnd for the last \u2013 and leading a lot. I\u2019m going to go over that because I go over polls. I love polls. I love polls. \nNow when \u2013 if they turn negative, I don\u2019t like them. And I promise if they turn negative, I\u2019m not going to be talking about them. \nIn fact, I get criticized all the time. \u201cYou\u2019re always talking about your polls.\u201d One of these guys has got 2%. He\u2019s at 2%. I\u2019m at 42%. And one of these guys who\u2019s at 2% said \u201cHe always talks about his polls, and I don\u2019t.\u201d And I wouldn\u2019t either if I have 2%. I swear I wouldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t do it at all. \nBut you know, I love to tell the story where I\u2019ve spent nothing and Bush has spent $59 million but much higher than that. That\u2019s just. You know, because I see since them. You can\u2019t turn on this television without these commercials on Fox. Every two minutes it\u2019s a commercial on Trump. \nYou know what he did? It\u2019s false advertising. \nSo I killed him in the debate. According to Reuters, according to everybody, Drudge, who\u2019s an amazing guy by the way, if you don\u2019t know Drudge \u2013 Matt Drudge \u2013 right? He\u2019s a great guy. But Drudge \u2013 46%. 46%, you have 15 people. \nNow, you noticed a couple of them have dropped out...But 15, 16 people \u2013 46%. Time Magazine \u2013 49%. Think of it. Slate \u2013 51%. U.S. News and World Report \u2013 69% said I won the debate...PBS \u2013 Public Broadcasting System \u2013 69% said Trump won. \nYou know, it\u2019s amazing. We have Washington Times said 62%. CBS \u2013 59%. Fox \u2013 62%. Fox Las Vegas \u2013 62%. \nSo they all say \u2013 and I go back home. After that, I like to see how did I do. Did I look good? Looking good is very important. Right? Sometimes it\u2019s not as much like what you say it\u2019s how you look. I look good. Didn\u2019t sound too good. But that\u2019s okay... \nBut I go home and I watch and the pundits will say \u2013 I mean, they can\u2019t totally kill me because I know what\u2019s happening, we know what\u2019s happening. \u201cWell, Mr. Trump was okay tonight.\u201d I won every, every single online poll. I won. \nAnd then here\u2019s Bush. So Bush does an ad and he takes me and he was talking about, you know, something and he made a statement then I killed him...By the way, I\u2019m at 69%. He\u2019s at 1%. He got, he came in last. He takes the ad and I shouldn\u2019t even talk about him. He\u2019s down to two or three but it bothers me when I see a guy spending, you know, $60 million on ads against me a lot of it. Right? \nI said, \u201cWhy is he doing this? Doesn\u2019t he have something better? He should go home, just relax.\u201d No, honestly, he should go home and relax. He shouldn\u2019t be wasting his time. But it does. \nI said, \u201cWhy is this guy spending all this money?\u201d Now he\u2019s spending it actually against a couple of other guys. They were also very weak...But here\u2019s my ad. So he made a statement and after that his spin people said \u201cOh, he was great. He took on Trump.\u201d He took on Trump? I\u2019m standing here. He\u2019s over there. Took on Trump. He made a statement that was written by his pollster. You know? He said, \u201cMr. Trump, why don\u2019t you this \u2013 \u201c \nI said okay. Then I gave him an answer. I said, \u201cJeb, I\u2019m at 42%. You\u2019re at 2%.\u201d Right? It\u2019s a simple answer. \nWe have had no matter where we go \u2013 you know, it\u2019s a movement folks. This is a movement. \nNo matter where we go it\u2019s amazing. \nWe go to Dallas. We go to Oklahoma. We go all over. We went to the other night Iowa \u2013 packed. Every place. New Hampshire. Packed. Every place we go to it\u2019s like this. It\u2019s amazing and just great, great people. \nAnd they actually had to tell over 3,000 people \u201cGo home. We\u2019ll come back. We\u2019ll do another one.\u201d But they had to go home. Would you like to leave and we\u2019ll let them come in? \nNo? I didn\u2019t think so. \nBut they turned away a lot of people, which is too bad actually. So maybe next time \u2013 I don\u2019t know I think this is the largest room. I know it\u2019s a record for the room. You know it has to be a record because every inch of the room is taken with people and they\u2019re standing; they\u2019re not sitting. So that\u2019s great. \nWe love setting records. We want the country to set records. Right? \nSo you know, I do this and I love to do it and I talk about our success because that\u2019s ultimately what it\u2019s all about. \nI think we\u2019re going to do fantastically well in Iowa. I really think we\u2019re going to do great there. \nAnd I could say, \u201cOh, gee, if we came in the top 4 or 5\u201d \u2013 I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m looking to win everything. We want to run the table. We want to run them. Because that sends a signal. \nAnd you know, we\u2019ve been a little bit \u2013 we had to respond to Hillary. She came out with that \u2013 she came out \u2013 remember she wrote \u2013 she said, \u201cHe\u2019s demonstrated a penchant\u201d \u2013 I demonstrated a penchant \u2013 \u201cfor sexism.\u201d Can you believe it? Me. \nNobody respects women more than Donald Trump. That I can tell you. \nAnd you know, when she said that I had no choice because I didn\u2019t start it. I had no choice and I did have to mention her husband\u2019s situation. Okay? \nAnd that is now the biggest story on television by a factor of 10. \nSo we have to do it. \nYou can\u2019t let people push you around. You can\u2019t let people tell lies. You can\u2019t do it. \nYou know, it\u2019s interesting. One of the polls came out from CNBC and they said that if it\u2019s Trump against Hillary in the election, it will be the greatest voter turnout in the history of this country. I can see that. I can see it. \nAnd they said all of these people that are going to come in new \u2013 that never vote \u2013 they never vote, they don\u2019t care. They\u2019re going to mostly \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you what, they\u2019re going to vote for Trump. That\u2019s why they\u2019re coming in because they\u2019re so fed up with the system, this corrupt, horrible system. They\u2019re fed up with it. \nAnd they\u2019re fed up with those guys back there \u2013 the media. They are the worst. They are the worst. \nNo, no, no, they\u2019re fed up. They\u2019re fed up with the media. \n...And you know not all bad but there\u2019s so much dishonesty in the media, and I like to call it out. \nAnd one of the things that\u2019s really been amazing to me and it\u2019s been such \u2013 it\u2019s been so beautiful to watch \u2013 the level of genius in the public. They get it. You know? They really get it. \nThey want to marginalize us. They want to do all of this. And they want to make everybody look like \u201cOh, gee\u201d. \nThe level of genius. They fully understand. They know they\u2019re crooked. They know they\u2019re dishonest. And they really \u2013 otherwise, who gets worse publicity than me? And yet I see a poll at 42%. And you\u2019re talking about 15, 16 people \u2013 started with 17...And you know, I\u2019d be happy with 42% if we had three. Okay? Not thrilled. I\u2019d like to be over that 50% mark but I think we\u2019re doing really well. \nAnd you know it\u2019s interesting \u2013 but the debates \u2013 okay? \n...I love you...You know, the rooms \u2013 no matter where, whether it\u2019s stadiums or big ballrooms like this one. It\u2019s amazing. And there\u2019s love in the room. \n...The other night, I said \u2013 a friend of mine \u2013 a very, very successful guy who I would love to have negotiating against China. That\u2019s what we need. Not these hacks that we have. \nYou know, I have guys \u2013 Carl Icahn endorsed me. Great businessman. I have great, great business people that want to be involved. And we\u2019re going to use \u2013 we have the best. We have the best in the world but we don\u2019t use them. We use political hacks. We use special interest people that really don\u2019t care about the country. They care about their deals. This is going to change so fast. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks after winning the Indiana primary", "text": "I don\u2019t know. Is there a second? I mean, is there a second? I don\u2019t know. \nBut I have ask you folks to explain the status of that. \nBut he\u2019s done an amazing job and I think we\u2019re going to see something really, really fantastic. \nI also want to thank my staff, Paul, Cory, Pope. I mean, these people. What we\u2019ve been doing has been incredible. \nThe work has been unreal. \nAnd Jared [Kushner], married to my daughter Ivanka. I mean, honestly, you know Jared is a very successful real estate person but I actually think he likes politics more than he likes real estate. I\u2019m excited. And he\u2019s very good at politics. \nSo again folks this has been an amazing evening. I didn\u2019t expect this. I didn\u2019t expect it. \nAnd what Ted did is really a very brave thing to do and a great thing to do because we want to bring unity to the Republican Party. We have to bring unity. It\u2019s so much easier if we have it. \nAnd many, many people are calling that you wouldn\u2019t even believe \u2013 the media, the press, they wouldn\u2019t believe. People who have said the worst things about me \u2013 I\u2019ve never had things said about me like this. \nYou know, with my businesses, I\u2019ve always been very respected. People didn\u2019t talk to me this way. But in politics, it\u2019s easy. \nThe worst things and they\u2019re calling now and they\u2019re calling us all and they\u2019re saying, \u201cWe\u2019d love to get on the train\u201d \u2013 the \u201cTrump Train\u201d they call it \u2013 \u201cBut we\u2019d love to get on the team.\u201d \nAnd I actually spoke to one today who was vicious. I mean, this guy was unbelievable. And I said, \u201cI\u2019d love having you and I think it\u2019s terrific. But after what you said about me how can you possibly join our team?\u201d And he said, \u201cMr. Trump, don\u2019t even think about it. Don\u2019t worry about it. There\u2019ll be no problem.\u201d In other words, he\u2019s a politician; there\u2019s no problem. I would have had a hard time. \nBut we have a lot of people coming \u2013 lots of congressmen. I have to thank Jeff Sessions \u2013 Sen. Jeff Sessions \u2013 one of the most respected men or people in Congress. \nAnd so many others. I mean, Sarah Palin has been from day one incredible. \nJerry Falwell, Jr. Liberty University, I mean he is something. He is really a special person. They\u2019ve done an incredible job and everybody goes through Liberty. We all go through Liberty and somehow he liked what I was saying and perhaps he liked the way I said it. But he\u2019s a special guy and he really has helped. And so many pastors and ministers. \nAnd tonight, I see that I won with the evangelicals. The evangelical vote was for Trump. \nAnd there\u2019s no greater honor. No greater honor. We\u2019re going to work together for many, many years. We\u2019re going to make it so good. We\u2019re going to be saying Merry Christmas again. We\u2019re going to be saying it... \nAnd I won with women. I love winning with women. But I won with women. I won with men. We won with Hispanics. We won with African-Americans. We won with every \u2013 virtually every category. So it\u2019s just been an amazing evening. \nSo again, I want to congratulate Ted Cruz. He is a tough, smart competitor. I want to thank my wife and my family. It\u2019s an incredible family. \nI want to thank my staff \u2013 both my staff and my thousands and thousands of people that work for the Trump organization, and perhaps in all fairness more importantly on this evening and for what we\u2019re doing currently, my staff where we\u2019re running for the presidency. \nAnd remember this. Our theme is very simple. It\u2019s make America great. We will make America great again. We will start winning again. You will be so proud of this country very, very soon. \nThank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you! Thank you very much! \nSo, we\u2019re going to have unbelievably good relationships with other countries. \nBut likewise they have to treat us fairly and they have to understand that what we\u2019ve been doing over the years has been so wrong and so unfair to the United States, to its people, and to its taxpayers. \nSo that will change. And I will tell you, they\u2019re going to end up liking us better than they do right. They\u2019re going to respect us. \nIn this building right upstairs, I have the largest bank in the world from China. The relationship is fantastic. \nWe have great relationships with many foreign countries. But they have to respect us and they have to understand where we\u2019re coming from. \nAnd you know, it is a two-way street. And the two-way street means that we\u2019re going down one side and they\u2019re coming up the other. And we\u2019re going to meet and we are going to have something that\u2019s going to be really fabulous. \nNow, if that can\u2019t happen. If for some reason they want this system to continue the way it\u2019s going now, which is not fair and not good, where we\u2019re spending trillions and trillions of dollars probably $4 trillion in the Middle East. \nAnd we have to build our infrastructure, our roads. We have to rebuild our bridges, our airports, our hospitals in this country. \nWe\u2019ve become close to a third world country. You look at some of our airports; it\u2019s third world. And then you go to other countries and you see places like you\u2019ve never seen. \nSo I have to say that we are going to turn it around. \nWe\u2019re going to build up our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before. It\u2019s the cheapest thing we can do. And we\u2019re going to have to take out ISIS and we\u2019re going to have to take them out fast. We can\u2019t allow that cancer to continue. We cannot allow it to continue. \nAnd you know, one group that\u2019s been so incredible to me are the vets \u2013 the veterans. And they\u2019ve been treated so badly. So badly. And we\u2019re going to get that straightened out. \nNow, one of the things that just happened, which to me is very exciting and it\u2019s happened now with two or three. But the Rasmussen poll came out yesterday and in that poll, I\u2019m now leading Hillary Clinton. A lot of good things... \nAnd that\u2019s going to continue because they\u2019re not going to be able to do it, folks. \nThey\u2019re not going to be able to make great trade deals. We have such bad deals. \nThey\u2019re not going to be able to do what we do with the military. \nThey\u2019re not going to be able to do what we\u2019re going to do on the border, including the wall. \nWe\u2019re going to have unbelievably great relationships with the Hispanics. The Hispanics have been so incredible to me. They want jobs. Everybody want jobs. The African-Americans want jobs. You look at what\u2019s going on. They want jobs. \nAnd we\u2019re going to bring back our jobs. We\u2019re going to save our jobs and people are going to have great jobs again. \nAnd this country, which is very, very divided in so many different ways is going to become one beautiful loving country. And we\u2019re going to love each other. We\u2019re going to cherish each other. We\u2019re going to take care of each other. And we\u2019re going to have great economic development. \nAnd we\u2019re not going to let other countries take it away from us because that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening for far too many years and we\u2019re not going to do it anymore. We\u2019re not going to do it anymore. \nI want to thank and congratulate the Republican National Committee and Reince Priebus, who I just spoke to. He\u2019s doing a tremendous job. It\u2019s not an easy job when he had 17 egos and now I guess he\u2019s down to one. \nAnd all of the different state \u2013 Connecticut. And I\u2019ve witnessed what it\u2019s done really firsthand. And it has been indeed carnage. \nAnd we\u2019re going to change it around. \nWe\u2019re not going to let Carrier and all of these companies just think they can move \u2013 go to another country, make their products, sell it back to us, and we get only one thing: We get unemployment. Not going to happen anymore, folks. Not going to happen anymore. \nWe\u2019re going to bring back our jobs and we\u2019re going to keep our jobs. We\u2019re not going to let companies leave. \nNow, if they want to go to a different state, good luck, compete. \nBut when they start going to different countries and in many cases countries that devalue their currency and make it impossible for our companies to compete, that\u2019s not going to happen. Not going to happen. \nAnd if they want to do it anyway, there will be consequences, and there will be very, very serious consequences. \nI have to tell you that I\u2019ve competed all my life. Competitive person. All my life I\u2019ve been in competitions. Different competitions whether it\u2019s sports or business or now for 10 months politics. \nAnd I have to tell you that I have met some of the most incredible competitors that I have ever competed against right here on the Republican Party. \nYou know, we started off with that 17 number. And just so you understand \u2013 Ted Cruz \u2013 I don\u2019t know if he likes me or if he doesn\u2019t like me. But he is one hell of a competitor. He is a tough, smart guy. \nAnd he has got an amazing future. He\u2019s got an amazing future. So I want to congratulate Ted. \nAnd I know how tough it is. It\u2019s tough. It\u2019s tough. \nI\u2019ve had some moments where it\u2019s not looking so good, and it\u2019s not a great feeling. And so I understand how Ted feels and Heidi and their whole beautiful family. \nAnd I just want to say that one tough competitor and I can say that for the others. I mean, Chris Christie who endorsed me. Incredible guy. Dr. Ben Carson who was right up there, one of the first. He just called me and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a movement you\u2019ve got going. We\u2019ve got to do something because I\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s an incredible movement.\u201d And Dr. Ben Carson endorsed me. And I want to tell you that is an incredible man and we want to keep Ben totally involved because we\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win in November. \nAnd we\u2019re going to win big and it\u2019s going to be America first. \nYou know, I made a speech the other day and I talked about how we\u2019re the policemen for the world, how we protect other countries and they don\u2019t respect us and they don\u2019t take care of us and they don\u2019t treat us right in many cases. \nAnd that\u2019s not going to happen. \nNow, we\u2019re going to keep things going and we\u2019re going to keep things going very nicely but we owe \u2013 soon \u2013 $21 trillion. It\u2019s $19 trillion now but with a budget that was recently done, soon it will be $21 trillion. \nAnd we\u2019re just not in a position that we\u2019re in 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 50 years ago when a lot of these things took place and began taking place. \nAnd I must say in staying in various places in Indiana, I turned on the television and all I saw was negative ads, negative one after another after another. \nAnd I called my people and I said, \u201cHow can we win? It\u2019s just constantly.\u201d It was the same as in Florida. You know, there\u2019ve been 60,000 negative ads. \nI got it right from you folks, okay? 60,000. In fact, two weeks ago it was 55,000. Now it\u2019s 60,000 negative ads \u2013 most of which are absolutely false and disgusting. And I said how can anybody endure this? \nI had one evening two nights ago where literally they had five ads on in between segments of a show that I was watching. And I said that\u2019s just incredible. \nAnd the people are so smart. They don\u2019t buy it. They get it. \nAnd it\u2019s tremendous, tremendous amounts of money were spent \u2013 millions and millions of dollars. And they were comparing it. They think it was probably $8 million was spent against me and we spent $900,000. So, I mean, to me that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. That\u2019s something that makes me feel really, really very good. \nAnd now we\u2019re going to Nebraska where I have \u2013 I just hear we\u2019re doing really wonderfully. I look forward to that very much. \nAnd West Virginia. And we\u2019re going to get those miners back to work. I\u2019ll tell you what. We\u2019re going to get those miners back to work. \nWe\u2019re not going to be Hillary Clinton, and I watched her three or four weeks ago where she was talking about the miners as if they were just numbers and she was talking about she wants the mines closed and she will never let them work again. \nLet me tell you, the miners in West Virginia and Pennsylvania which was so great to me last week and Ohio and all over, they\u2019re going to start to work again. Believe me. You\u2019re going to be proud again to be miners. \nSo we\u2019ll be going there. I must say this tremendous run that we\u2019ve had started with New York when we had almost 62%. And don\u2019t forget, that\u2019s with three people. So 62% with two people is a massive landslide. But 63% almost \u2013 just a little over 62% \u2013 when you have that kind of a number with three people, it\u2019s actually unheard of. \nAnd all throughout, it was 17 people, then 15, then 12, you know, it\u2019s tremendous, and we were getting very high numbers. And some of the numbers in my opinion that I got in the early stages were in a state with 32% but there were 14 people. I think that might actually be more and better than getting 62% in New York. But we never got the credit for that. \nBut now we don\u2019t need the credit because we\u2019re going after Hillary Clinton. She will not be a great president. She will not be a good president. She will be a poor president. \nShe doesn\u2019t understand trade. Her husband signed perhaps in the history of the world the single worst trade deal ever done. It\u2019s called NAFTA. \nAnd I was witnessed to the carnage over the last six weeks especially. Now I\u2019ve known Syracuse and I\u2019ve known Poughkeepsie and I\u2019ve known all of the different places that I visited in New York and then Pennsylvania and then Maryland, which treated me so great the people are incredible. \nWell, thank you very much everyone. \nI want to start by, as always, thanking my family. My wife, Melania. My kids \u2013 they\u2019re not kids anymore but they\u2019re kids as far as I\u2019m concerned. They\u2019ll always be my kids. And I want to thank my great parents who are looking down right now and my brother looking down on us. I want to thank my entire family, including Maryanne, Elizabeth, Robert. \nAnd it\u2019s been some unbelievable day and evening and year. I never have been through anything like this but it\u2019s a beautiful thing to watch and a beautiful thing to behold, and we\u2019re going to make America great again. We\u2019re going to make America great again. \nSo important \u2013 so important that the people of Indiana have been incredible. \nI started as you know not very long ago \u2013 about six weeks ago \u2013 and I was told that I had a 20 point deficit. \nAnd I went there and I worked very hard and I campaigned and I made lots of speeches and met lots of incredible people \u2013 incredible people. You don\u2019t get better, and the crowds got bigger and bigger. And toward the end, it was like I didn\u2019t want to leave. I almost said, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just never leave\u201d and it resonated somehow and we have a tremendous victory tonight. \nIt was a tremendous victory. \nAnd I have to thank Bobby Knight. Boy, Bobby Knight was incredible. He was incredible. \nI always that people like that \u2013 there aren\u2019t many \u2013 but it\u2019s called tough, smart, and they know how to win. And that\u2019s what our country needs. We have to win again. We have to know how to win. \nAnd we haven\u2019t won. We\u2019ve been losing all the time. We lose with our military. We can\u2019t beat ISIS. We lose with trade. We lose with borders. We lose everything. \nWe\u2019re not going to lose. We\u2019re going to start winning again and we\u2019re going to win big league. Believe me. \nSo when I got back tonight and I started watching all of the different networks, I could immediately that we were doing very well, and it really looks like a massive victory and it looks like we win all 57 delegates. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech after winning the South Carolina primary", "text": "We are going to build our military, which I thank, because a number of the people came down and a number of the pundits watching tonight \u2013 we love our military. We love our military. \nAnd by the way, we love our police. Our police are terrific. We love our police. They are not being treated properly. \nWe\u2019re going to build our military so big, so good, so strong, so powerful that nobody is ever going to mess with us, folks. And we\u2019re going to buy the equipments that our generals, our soldiers, and everybody that\u2019s in the know want. We\u2019re not buying equipment that sells because they have political people, because they take campaign and they give campaign contributions. We are going to get the equipment that they want, not the equipment that they\u2019re told to have by senators and congressmen in Washington. We\u2019re going to have great equipment. \nAnd the reason I can say that is I\u2019m self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m not getting millions of dollars from all of these \u2013 I\u2019m not getting millions of dollars from all of these special interests and lobbyists and donors that once they get it they literally do whatever the politicians want. That\u2019s not going to happen. \nAnd we\u2019re going to take care of our vets. We love our vets and they\u2019re being treated terribly. We\u2019re taking are of our vets. \nSo, we\u2019re now off to Nevada and it\u2019s a great state and we have great people. We have great people in our nation no matter where we go. I went to Mobile, Alabama \u2013 35,000 people. We went to Oklahoma recently twice \u2013 20,000 people, 20,000 people. No matter where we go, we fill up the arenas. \nOver here the other day, we had a 9,000. We had a 10,000. We have people \u2013 the only thing that stops the crowds are the walls because we can\u2019t get them in. We have to send thousands of people away. \nTime Magazine \u2013 Time Magazine last week did an incredible cover story. They said it\u2019s a movement, and that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s an incredible movement with incredible people \u2013 incredible people. \nIt\u2019s an incredible movement with incredible people, I tell you. And whether we go \u2013 honestly, whether we go to Dallas or whether we go to anywhere you say \u2013 you go to LA \u2013 you go anywhere you say our people are incredible. \nAnd you know, our theme \u2013 what\u2019s our theme? You know it, right? Right? Our theme, which I love may be the greatest theme of all time, right? And the word again is eventually going to come off. We\u2019re going to get rid of the whole theme because what\u2019s going to happen \u2013 make America great again. Right? And the last two weeks because I\u2019ve gotten to see so many, I guess, millions when you add them all up with all of these rooms and all of these speeches and I\u2019ve met so many people. But the people are so incredible that I\u2019ve been saying make America great again and it\u2019s going to be greater than ever before. That\u2019s the kind of potential that we have \u2013 greater than ever before. \nSo, I want to thank everybody. I love you all. Again, South Carolina, we will never forget you. We will never forget you. We will never ever forget South Carolina. We will never forget our great volunteers. We love our volunteers. We\u2019ll never forget all of the people that have helped us so much, my family. \nAnd folks, let\u2019s go \u2013 let\u2019s have a big win in Nevada. Let\u2019s have a big win at the SEC. Let\u2019s put this thing away and let\u2019s make America great again. \nThank you very much. Thank you very much. \nI also want to congratulate the other candidates, in particular I have to say Ted and Marco did a really good job. They did quite well as I understand...But I just want to congratulate the other candidates. \nThere\u2019s nothing easy about running for president, I can tell you. It\u2019s tough. It\u2019s nasty. It\u2019s mean. It\u2019s vicious. It\u2019s beautiful. When you win, it\u2019s beautiful. \nAnd we\u2019re going to start \u2013 we are going to start winning for our country. We are going to start winning because our country doesn\u2019t win anymore. Doesn\u2019t win. \nWe don\u2019t win with the military. We can\u2019t beat ISIS. We have great military but we can\u2019t beat ISIS. \nWe don\u2019t win on trade. You look at what China\u2019s doing to us, what Japan does to us, what Mexico is just killing us at the border \u2013 at the border and with trade. \nMexico is killing us absolutely. We\u2019ll do the wall. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re going to do the wall. We\u2019re going to do the wall and by the way, who\u2019s going to pay for the wall? Mexico is going to pay for the wall, and it\u2019s very easy. The other politicians come down, \u201cYou can\u2019t get Mexico to pay for the wall.\u201d I said, \u201c100%.\u201d We have a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico. The wall is going to cost $10 billion to $12 billion. Okay? Believe me, they will pay. \nOne of the officials \u2013 actually one of the ex-officials from Mexico had a news conference and he announced that \u201cWe will not be paying for the wall. Who does Mr. Trump think he is?\u201d They came to me \u2013 the press \u2013 these people. Look at all those cameras back there. The press came to me and they told me that \u201cHe said they would not pay for the wall. Do you have a comment?\u201d I said, \u201cYes. The wall just got 10 feet taller.\u201d It\u2019s true. \nAnd I love Mexico. I love Mexico. I love China. I love many of these countries that rip us off because we have leaders that are incompetent and don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. I love these countries and they\u2019re great. \nI have thousands and thousands of Hispanics. We\u2019re going to Nevada. I lead \u2013 I lead with the Hispanics. I\u2019m leading in every poll with the Hispanics. They love me. I love them. \nThe problem is that the leaders of these countries, whether it\u2019s Mexico or Japan or Vietnam, which is just doing a big number now all of a sudden, or China in particular \u2013 that\u2019s the big one \u2013 the greatest abuse of a country that I think I\u2019ve ever seen financially \u2013 China \u2013 what they\u2019ve done to us is the greatest single theft in the history of the world. They\u2019ve taken our jobs. They\u2019ve taken our money. They\u2019ve taken everything. \nWe\u2019re bringing our jobs back, folks. We\u2019re bringing our jobs back. We\u2019re going to bring them back, and I know how to do it. \nWe\u2019ve had so many \u2013 we\u2019ve had so many incredible endorsements. And to me getting the greatest business people to endorse me is very important \u2013 Carl Icahn endorsed me. So many others have endorsed me. \nAnd we\u2019re going to put these great business people in charge of trade, and when China wants to come and negotiate, they\u2019re going to negotiate not with a political hack, which is what they have now, they\u2019re going to negotiate with the best business minds in the world and we have them in this country. \nSo, we\u2019re going to do a lot of beautiful work. We\u2019re going to terminate Obamacare. It\u2019s going to be terminated. It\u2019s going to be over. It\u2019s going to be repealed, and it\u2019s going to be replaced and you\u2019re going to have much better health care at a much smaller cost. Because Obamacare \u2013 if you look \u2013 look at the increases in your Obamacare \u2013 25%, 35%, 45%, even 55%. It\u2019s dead. It\u2019s not working. We\u2019re going to go to a plan that\u2019s going to be so much better and so much less expensive. \nSo, Second Amendment by the way this is a room loves the Second Amendment. Thank you, fellas. This is a room loves and cherishes the Second Amendment. We are going to protect our Second Amendment. \nCommon Core is gone. We are getting rid of Common Core. We are bringing education to a local level. The people in this community \u2013 every time I see them, they want education locally. The parents, the teachers, they want to do it. They don\u2019t want bureaucrats telling them how to educate their children. \nWe spend as a nation more for education per pupil than any other nation in the world. Not even close. More per pupil. Second place doesn\u2019t even exist it\u2019s so different. And yet, out of 30 countries, we\u2019re ranked number 30. You have China, you have Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and then you have number 30 \u2013 the United States. So we spend the most and we\u2019re at the bottom of the heap. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore, folks. Not going to happen anymore. \nThanks everybody. \nWell, I want to begin by thanking the people of South Carolina. This is a special state. Thank you. These are special people. \nAnd you know, we got a boost last week from a place we all remember \u2013 New Hampshire \u2013 we can\u2019t forget it. Special, special \u2013 we love it. And they sent us in here with a very good feeling, right? Very good feeling. So I really want to thank you. \nAnd my volunteers \u2013 all of these people, volunteers and they travel \u2013 and I say \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d And now they\u2019re going to Texas and they\u2019re going all over. Some are going to Nevada. \nI\u2019ll be going to Nevada. We\u2019re making a big speech tomorrow in Atlanta. And then we\u2019re going right to Nevada. And I think we\u2019re going to do terrific there, and the SEC is going to be very, very exciting. We expect to do very, very well. \nI want to just say thank you to my family. It\u2019s been not easy for them. They don\u2019t see me anymore. I\u2019m making speeches all the time. And I have a great family. I really have a great family, so I just want to thank all of you. \nAnd Ivanka, you know, we have a hospital ready just in case in South Carolina we\u2019re going to have a baby. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It could be any second. It could even be before I\u2019m finished. But you know she insisted on being here. It was so important to Ivanka to insist on being here. So thank you... \nWe have a wonderful lieutenant governor who backed us very early in the process. You know Henry [McMaster], right? The lieutenant governor of South Carolina. I will take him over the governor any time because we won. We won. \nHe can handle that very nicely. He\u2019s tough. He\u2019s very tough. \nTiffany, Eric, Laura, and Melania. \nMelania, say some. Go on. \nMelania Trump: \nJust want to say an amazing place South Carolina. Congratulations to my husband. He was working very hard. And he loves you. We love you. And we\u2019re going ahead to Nevada and you will see what happens. He will be the best president. \nIvanka Trump:\nThank you, South Carolina. This is an amazing, amazing night. The momentum since the beginning of this campaign has been unbelievable and that\u2019s because my father\u2019s message resonates so deeply with so many people. So, as our family, we\u2019re incredibly proud. We\u2019re incredibly grateful to each of you. So thank you for being here to support us. And I will say this: My father is an incredibly hard worker and he\u2019ll be working for each and every one of you. So together, we\u2019ll make America great again. \nSo, you know, I was watching upstairs and it was really amazing to be watching what I was watching. And some of the pundits, you know, overall fair but not too much. But a number of the pundits said, \u201cWell, if a couple of the other candidates dropped out, if you add their scores together, it\u2019s going to equal Trump.\u201d \nThese geniuses \u2013 they\u2019re geniuses \u2013 they don\u2019t understand that as people drop out, I\u2019m going to get a lot of those votes also. You don\u2019t just add them together. \nSo I think we\u2019re going to do very, very well. I think we\u2019re going to do very well.

Mexico is not helping. \nDo you know if you want to become a citizen of Mexico \u2013 I love the Mexican people. I have many Mexican people and Hispanics working for me. In Nevada, I\u2019m number one. I\u2019m rated number one in the polls with the Hispanics. Everyone\u2019s shocked. \nBecause the Hispanics that are here legally, those people they want me, they know I\u2019m going to bring jobs and everything else. They don\u2019t want people pouring in. \nBut I will tell you Mexico has got to help us. \nYou know, if you want to become a citizen of Mexico...do you know it\u2019s one of the hardest countries in the world to become a citizen of? And yet, people pour right through into us, into us. They call us the dumb Americans. That\u2019s what they call us because of our leaders. They call us the dumb Americans. \nIf you want to become a citizen of Mexico, you could take the best person in this room, the most qualified, you\u2019re not going to do it. They don\u2019t do that. \nAnd if you\u2019re there illegally and if you overstay your bound? You\u2019re not going to be there illegally. But if you have a pass for two weeks and you overstay your bound, they have cops waiting for you. They have police that say, \u201cYou know you have one day left.\u201d I hear it\u2019s unbelievable. I\u2019m impressed actually. Because to a certain extent, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. \nBut if you want to become a citizen of Mexico, it\u2019s impossible. They don\u2019t have anchor babies in Mexico. You\u2019re born a baby in Mexico, it\u2019s like bye-bye. \nHere, you\u2019re born over here, \u201cOh, congratulations we\u2019re taking care of the baby for 85 years.\u201d Not going to happen. It\u2019s not going to happen. No, it\u2019s not going to happen. \nBy the way, this is important, I sort of lucked into this one. The 14th Amendment. It says right there \u2013 you know, everybody says you have to go through a whole process, it\u2019ll take many years, you have to go through every state. You have to do another amendment. It\u2019s wrong. 14th Amendment covers it. \nAnd some of the best legal minds in the world say \u201cTrump is right.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat? I am? I didn\u2019t know.\u201d I lucked into it. Every once in a while you luck. \nThe fact is somebody comes in illegally and they have a baby, we\u2019re not responsible. Now, we may have a court case but we\u2019re going to win it. And a simple act of Congress gets rid of it. And a lot of people didn\u2019t know that. Okay? \nAnd the reason I said it can be possible because nobody could be foolish enough to allow a thing like that. How could it be possible? And we\u2019re one of the only countries where that takes place. \nAnd honestly, I use Mexico as an example because they\u2019re so tough. If that happens in Mexico, they don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about. What are you talking about? But with us? No good. Not going to happen anymore. \nQuestion on Medicare and single-payer system: \nAnd you are bringing up a point that I\u2019ve heard before. We\u2019re going to look at a lot of different things. \nBut we\u2019re going to save Social Security, we\u2019re going to save Medicare and that\u2019s the way it is. Okay? We\u2019re not abolishing like other people. \nQuestion on the federal budget and paying for immigration reform: \nAnd Dwight Eisenhower is going to say he moved 1.5 million in the 1950s, early 1950s, moved them out. \nWe have tremendous illegal immigration problems. Dwight Eisenhower, nice guy, he moved 1.5 million people out of the United States. And you know what happened? He moved them right across the border and they came back and they moved them again and they came back. They moved them a third time, they came right back. \nAnd then you know they were tougher in those days. They moved them all the way south \u2013 all the way south \u2013 and they didn\u2019t come back. \nNow, we have to do it. We have no choice. We either have a country or we don\u2019t. \nAnd I want them to come back. But I want them to come back with papers. I want them to come back legally. I want them to come back. The good ones. The good ones. But only the good ones. \nWe got some bad ones. Remember the heat I took with illegal immigration? Remember that heat? For two weeks. Rush Limbaugh said \u201cHe has received more incoming than any human being I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d And then he double-downed... \nYou know what? I took a lot of heat and then you had Kate in San Francisco, killed, shot in the back and so many others. And people started looking. \nAnd let me tell you, we have some wonderful people over here and they\u2019re here illegally but they\u2019re wonderful people. Okay? And we\u2019ll try to get them back real soon and we\u2019ll do it through a legal process. \nBut we also have some really bad gang members. You know, some of the gangs in LA. They\u2019re made up of illegal immigrants. \nAnd we have unbelievable police forces that don\u2019t get the respect that they should get. They don\u2019t get it. I mean, what they go through, it\u2019s unbelievable. They\u2019re afraid to talk to anybody. They don\u2019t want to lose their jobs. They don\u2019t want to lose their pensions. They can\u2019t talk. \nNow, let me just tell you something. You can always have bad apples. In this room, we have a couple of bad apples. Okay? I don\u2019t know who they are or where they are but you do. Probably mostly back there in the press. \nBut the police do an unbelievable job. And they know the gangs. You go to LA the LA cops. You got Chicago, the Chicago cops. These people are amazing people if they would be allowed to do their jobs. But they\u2019re not allowed to do their jobs. \nAnd we\u2019re going to get the bad ones out of here so fast and they\u2019re not coming back and I don\u2019t want to put them in our jails because I don\u2019t want to subsidize these various countries where they come from for the next 45 years. I don\u2019t want them in our jails. We have hundreds of thousands right now in our jails. I don\u2019t want them in our jails. \nI heard a couple of these candidates saying, \u201cWell, they\u2019re \u2013 \u201c They\u2019re such babies. \nBut you know what? They\u2019re talking about putting them in jail. Well, I don\u2019t want them. Our jails are over-brimming. I want to use our jails for people that are supposed to be there. Okay? And I don\u2019t want to put these really bad dudes \u2013 I mean, they are bad \u2013 I don\u2019t want to have to pay for them for the next 45 years. Okay? \nAnd we\u2019re going to deal very humanely with the good people and they are mostly good people. But we\u2019ve got some real bad ones and they\u2019re out of here. Your head will spin probably. \nSomebody said the other day, \u201cWhat\u2019s the first thing you\u2019re going to do?\u201d Well, we\u2019re going to work immediately on repealing Obamacare. \nYou know, the one good thing about executive orders? The one good thing? You know, Obama signed an executive order where everybody just come in. Come in. \nWe have great border patrol people. I got to know them a couple of months ago when I went down to Texas to the border. They\u2019re great people. They\u2019re not allowed to do their job. They stand there and watch people walk right in front of them smiling at them. They want to do their job; they\u2019re not allowed to. \nSo the executive order that President Obama signed, the one good thing about an executive order, in the first minute in office, I will counter-sign and revoke those executive orders. They\u2019ll be revoked. The only good thing. \nIt\u2019s actually the only good thing about an executive order is that a new president can just do a signature and that\u2019s the end of that. \nSo we\u2019re going to clean up our border. We\u2019re going to make it fantastic. We\u2019re going to be proud to be a country again and a lot of good things are going to happen. \nQuestion on caring for veterans: \nI hear only \u2013 I just hear terrible. And we\u2019re going to solve that problem. You know, it can be solved. \nThe waits now for the VA are longer than they\u2019ve ever been...The waits now are worse than they\u2019ve ever been. Thousands of people dying waiting for a doctor. Okay, dying. \nAnd you find the same thing, you say. You have to use your own because they won\u2019t do anything. \nSo we\u2019re going to take care of our vets and we\u2019re going to take care of the VA and it\u2019s going to be one of the things we\u2019re going to be releasing pretty soon. \nBut one of the things we\u2019re going to do with the VA, we have a lot of hospitals that aren\u2019t doing any business. We have a lot of private doctors that could do more business. \nWe\u2019re losing a lot of our doctors because of Obamacare. They\u2019re retiring. They\u2019re leaving. \nOne of them \u2013 a friend of mine \u2013 said \u201cI have more nurses working for me now more than before but I have more accountants\u201d and the end result is a disaster; he\u2019s getting out of the business. He\u2019s got nurses but he\u2019s got more accountants than he has nurses because the paperwork is so crazy. \nSo one of the things we\u2019re going to do is if Todd or if you or if somebody has problems because of the wait \u2013 because the waits are unbelievable \u2013 5, 6, 7 days sometimes. They\u2019re going to a private doctor. They\u2019re going to go to a private hospital. Or a public hospital that\u2019s in the area. And we\u2019re going to pay for that and it\u2019s going to cost less money \u2013 it\u2019s going to cost less money than the system we have now \u2013 and you\u2019re going to end up getting much better care. It\u2019s going to cost less and you\u2019re going to get better care... \nQuestion on the Keystone Pipeline: \nAnd Hillary should have approved it. \nYou know, Hillary wanted to approve it but she\u2019s been dragged so far left, that\u2019s she\u2019s \u2013 forget it. It\u2019s a disaster. \nSo I would approve it. \nBut with that being said, I may want to make a better deal because you know what? We\u2019re bringing oil from Canada. Right? I may say, I want 10%. We\u2019re going to approve it but I want 10%, 15%. \nBecause the truth is that the Keystone Pipeline was better a while ago than it is now because we have so much because of new technology, we have so much energy underneath our own feet with the fracking and all of the other things that have emerged over the last five years, we have so much energy. And it\u2019s great stuff. \nWe have really great quality, higher than Canada. You know, they have the tar sands, which is a problem for them. Very expensive to get it out. \nWe have great stuff. So I would approve it because I love the jobs of building it. I love the jobs of building it. \nBut I may just say, maybe we should get 10%, 15%, maybe 20% as that oil flows through our land. You know, maybe we should do that. \nSo I\u2019m going to look into that. But when I approve it \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you what, when I approve it, it\u2019ll be a great deal for the United States. It won\u2019t be like \u2013 because right now, what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re approving it, we\u2019re not really getting anything. They\u2019re putting it underground, and that\u2019s actually good environmentally. Better than having trucks going down the road and everything else. That\u2019s good environmentally. But we\u2019re not getting \u2013 we\u2019re not getting \u2013 anything much for it. \nWhen I get finished with the Keystone, they\u2019ll be happy and we\u2019ll be happy. Okay? \nQuestion on the war on poverty: \nNow, you look like you\u2019re doing pretty well in all fairness. But still, we have 50 million. We have 46 million people and they\u2019re getting food stamps. 46 million. Think of it. You know, we talk about how well we\u2019re doing. \nSo we have 50 million \u2013 almost 50 million each between poverty, food stamps, and it\u2019s got to end. \nOne of the problems \u2013 we don\u2019t have enough jobs in this country. It\u2019s very simple. You know, it\u2019s so simple when you think about it. \nOur jobs have been taken away. \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what else, middle income folks \u2013 their salaries haven\u2019t gone up in 12 years. People are making less wages now than they were 12 years ago. And other things have gone up. So they\u2019re really doing much worse than they were doing 12 years ago. \nBut that\u2019s an amazing stat. \nBut people \u2013 one of the reasons they say I\u2019m doing so well because I let people know we\u2019re going to bring jobs back. We\u2019re going to bring industry and plants. We\u2019re going to bring it all back and nobody else can say that. We\u2019re going to bring it back because a lot of the folks in this room are doing worse than they were 12 years ago and they\u2019re working. \nThen the other thing, you have a lot of part-time jobs. I have some people that I know very well and they\u2019ve had a job for 20 years at the same place. All of a sudden they\u2019re working part-time because of Obamacare because from an accounting standpoint, it just works better. They love the owners, the stores and things. They love the owners; they think the owners are great. But the owners are forced to make part-time jobs; they have part-time jobs. They work all their life. They have a wonderful company that they\u2019re working for, and now all of a sudden they\u2019re cut into part-time jobs because of Obamacare because of the rulings of Obamacare. And you all know what I\u2019m talking about. \nSo they end up being part-time workers and they don\u2019t want to be part-time workers. They don\u2019t even like the psychology of being called a part-time worker. And we\u2019re not going to have that stuff anymore. We\u2019re not going to have it any more. \nWe\u2019re going to have real jobs and the numbers are going to go up. Believe me. The numbers are right now worse than 12 years ago and that\u2019s a shame. \nSo we take that and it\u2019s something that I think is important. \nSo I always preface it by saying I don\u2019t consider that funding but I\u2019m self-funding my campaign and I\u2019m getting ready to put up millions, millions. \nAnd something I\u2019m very proud of that I think it\u2019s great and it\u2019s you know really great, it hasn\u2019t gotten very much publicity, hasn\u2019t gotten much publicity, but I have spent less money than any other candidate. Okay? By far. I think. I don\u2019t know, probably a couple of guys that have nothing so they just go around...But I was told that I spend less. And I have the best results because in most polls I\u2019m number one. \nNow, until Iowa came along, I said \u201cevery poll\u201d, and then Iowa \u2013 what the hell are you people doing to me? You know? You know? \nI\u2019m telling you. They said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you skip Iowa?\u201d They told me that. Everybody said \u201cSkip Iowa\u201d. All of the political geniuses. \nA man just interviewed me back there, great reporter. He\u2019s actually a great reporter. Of course, if he writes a bad story, I won\u2019t say that. But he is. He\u2019s a great reporter. \nAnd he said, \u201cWould you ever think of maybe skipping Iowa going right to New Hampshire? And then you\u2019d go to South Carolina\u201d where I\u2019m leading by massive \u2013 yeah, you\u2019ve got to see the rallies there. They\u2019re incredible. \n\u201cBut you\u2019d go to New Hampshire. You\u2019d go to South Carolina. You go to Nevada. You go to the SCC.\u201d \nI said I can\u2019t do that because I have such an unbelievable relationship with the people from Iowa that I think we\u2019re going to win. I really do. I believe it. I believe it. \nAnd I don\u2019t want to skip Iowa. I think we\u2019re going to do well. I think we\u2019re going to do great with evangelicals. I think a lot of things are going to come out over the next period of time that are not going to be so good for our opponents, honestly, and I think I\u2019m going to do great with the evangelicals because I am the real deal. I will tell you that. I\u2019m the real deal. \nSo I told these political pros, you know, I hate to say it but the last long number of elections on the Republican circuit, the person that won Iowa did not get the nomination. Okay? I want to take away some of your muster. You understand that. \nSo could we do \u2013 and please do me a favor? Let me win Iowa. And then I\u2019m going to win, I\u2019m telling you we\u2019re going to win New Hampshire, and we\u2019re going to win South Carolina. \nA great poll just came out on North Carolina just a little while. A PPP poll. It was great. Some of you saw that. But great poll. \nBut we\u2019re going to go on and we\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win. \nAnd actually, one of the pundits \u2013 because you have some smart pundits and some very, very dumb pundits. A lot of pundits said \u201cHe\u2019ll never run. He\u2019s not going to run.\u201d They\u2019re still trying to recover. \nBut one of the very smart one says \u201cIf Trump wins Iowa, it\u2019s over.\u201d It\u2019s interesting because it will go right through because everywhere else is so great. \nAnd I thought it was good here. Come on. Okay, so that\u2019s the end of that. \nBut I want to tell you, will you \u2013 I refuse to say \u201cGet your asses in gear.\u201d I will not say that. I will not say it. I will not say it because I don\u2019t want to use anything that\u2019s even a little bit off. \nSo will you please do me a favor and work with my people and go out on Feb. 1stand vote and give us a victory? \nAnd if I win Iowa, we\u2019re going to run the whole table and we are going to make such great deals and we\u2019re going to have such a great military and we\u2019re going to take care of our health care without that crazy Obamacare that\u2019s a nightmare. \nSo, I\u2019m sticking with you people. I\u2019m going to spend money here. I have a great team over here. And I will tell you I\u2019m going to spend a lot of time here and I really want to win Iowa and I think we should and it\u2019s so important. And you know, it\u2019s about time that Iowa could have a victory and let that person go onto a total victory. Okay? Not like over the last \u2013 right? \nSo, I love you all. I mean, we\u2019re having fun. But I love you all. But I do mean it. I\u2019m going to stay here. We\u2019re going to work really hard. \nWhen I heard the poll today, they said \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to work harder in Iowa.\u201d I\u2019m not leaving Iowa. I\u2019m not leaving Iowa. \nNow, if I lose Iowa, I will never speak to you people again. That I can tell you. \nOkay, let\u2019s do a couple of questions. Right? Come on. \nAnd what happened and I haven\u2019t talked about this before but I\u2019m seeing what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s horrible what\u2019s going on. What happened is the last time they had the Super PACs, I actually think there was sort of a wall. You know, they called it the wall. \nAnd this is a wall too. Won\u2019t be as good as the one I\u2019m going to build but it\u2019s a wall. \nBut it was a wall and they didn\u2019t deal. \nI mean, even though like Bush has a friend of his running his Super PAC, I\u2019m sure they never talk. I\u2019m sure. What do you think the chances are that they talk? 100% or 99%? 100%. I\u2019d say 100%. I\u2019d say 100%. Only a foolish person would say 99%. But whatever. \nThey\u2019re not supposed to. But they put a friend in there. They put other people in there. They put whoever. And that\u2019s the way it works. \nAnd in some cases, I hear in Ben\u2019s case, I hear in other cases, they\u2019re literally running. \nI mean, had Walker done this in all fairness because he had money in the Super PAC but he had no money in his campaign and he was unable to figure out this is what they\u2019re all doing. That\u2019s why he\u2019s out of the race because he couldn\u2019t figure it out. \nThe whole thing with Super PACs is a horrible, horrible scam. So I sent letters last week to as many as we could find. They\u2019re all over the place. We want you to close the Super PAC. We want nothing to do with it. We don\u2019t want to get advertisements. We don\u2019t want any of the money. Go home and ideally give the money back. They don\u2019t even have to give the money back from what I understand. They can keep it. They\u2019ll probably if they actually raised money for me, they\u2019ll say \u201cWhat a horrible thing he just said. I think we\u2019re going to support somebody else.\u201d They could do that. \nBut the Super PACs have total control over the people running for office. Total. Nothing over me. Nothing. \nI feel it\u2019s very unfair. I feel it\u2019s a very unfair situation. \nNow, if they want, they could have full disclosure and everything...But what are they doing with this whole thing? \nAnd I think it makes dishonest people out of people that might be honest. \nBut the Super PACs are controlling your candidates \u2013 some more than others. Some are unbelievable. \nAnd what the press should really do is take a look at how much money is left. When you read that Ben raised $1, how much is left after he pays all of the consultants and all of these people, how much is left to spend in the campaign. You\u2019ll be amazed. I mean, it\u2019s so little. \nBush, it\u2019s the same thing. \nAnd I\u2019ll go over \u2013 there are other names. I know every one of them. But it\u2019s a horrible thing that\u2019s taking place. \nAnd again, last cycle, at least they went through the motions. Now, they\u2019re not even going through the motions. They\u2019re not even going through. \nAnd just remember when I have to negotiate with companies to keep them in this country so they build jobs here and they build their plants here and their factories here and they do all of the things here, when I have to do that, you know, John Deere, I paid them tens of millions of dollars. You can even check. I said to John Deere, \u201cI want an endorsement.\u201d I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll give me an endorsement. I\u2019ll tell you if they don\u2019t they\u2019re not so smart. I guarantee no other person gave John Deere \u2013 I mean, I bought probably more than $10 million worth of John Deere equipments. I love it. You know why? Iowa. Iowa. I love it. I love it. \nWhen we can. By the way, it\u2019s a great company. It\u2019s a great company. But I buy a lot of stuff from John Deere because I have a lot of big developments that really require John Deere type equipment. I don\u2019t have to buy it from them. I could buy it from others. But I want to steer it to them when I can. \nBut we have to do something to clean up this political mess because it\u2019s crooked stuff. It\u2019s crooked stuff. And it\u2019s got to stop. \nAnd it\u2019s very unfair to people who go out and do it the way you\u2019re supposed to do it, including me. I think I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s self-funding. I\u2019m the only one putting up my own money, other than \u2013 I know it\u2019s precious \u2013 people write in to DonaldJTrump.com or whatever and they send me checks like $20. I keep saying the woman for $7.50, $50, $100. I don\u2019t want their money. But if you send it back it\u2019s totally insulting. \nI mean, they always write letters too. They write these beautiful letters \u2013 \u201cMr. Trump, I can\u2019t afford much and I know you don\u2019t need it but I\u2019m sending $50 because that\u2019s so important what you\u2019re saying about the country.\u201d It\u2019s beautiful. \nI mean, I\u2019ve seen such beautiful letters. And if I send it back, there\u2019s no letter I can write that\u2019s not going to be insulting to those people, really. \u201cDear Mr. So and So or Mrs. So and So, I don\u2019t need your money and thanks a lot but we\u2019re going to do it ourselves.\u201d If I got that back, I\u2019d say \u201cWho the hell does he think he is?\u201d \nSo I only say this and you know what? People might say \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. He\u2019s a terrible person, a terrible human being. But I\u2019m going to vote for him anyways.\u201d Okay, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m actually a nice person. \nI always say this \u2013 nobody can do this stuff better than me. And I know all the guys I\u2019m running against. They\u2019re wonderful people. Some of them I really like. But who cares? \nI was talking to one of the candidates the other day. I was talking about corporate inversions and they didn\u2019t even know what the hell I was talking. They had no idea. It\u2019s not their thing. \nAnd unless we stop all of the things that are going with other countries and unless we make great trade deals, we\u2019re being eaten alive. \nThat\u2019s why when you look at the phony numbers, we have 100 million people in our workforce that aren\u2019t working. Our real unemployment rate is probably 30%. It\u2019s not 5.3%. That was done for politicians so they\u2019d look good. It\u2019s not 5.3%. How can you have 5.3% when you have 100 million people? \nYou look for a job. If you\u2019re a young guy, that handsome young guy with the red hair, right there...but if he comes out and he goes into the workforce and he looks for a job and he goes through college and does well and then he can\u2019t get a job and when he gives up because at some point after months you give up, they essentially consider you employed. It\u2019s the most ridiculous thing. \nWe have a tremendous \u2013 tens of millions of people in that position. They can\u2019t find jobs. They\u2019re good people. They want to work. They can\u2019t. But it\u2019s not reflected in the real numbers because the politicians want to look good. \nSo let me just before we talk some questions, I\u2019m going to talk about something I\u2019ve never really talked about it onstage but we should talk about it. It\u2019s called Super PACs. \nIt\u2019s one of the great scams of all time. It\u2019s one of the great scams. \nSo we sent out \u2013 I think I had \u2013 and it\u2019s not me. People set them up. And I don\u2019t know. Maybe they\u2019re setting up for my benefit. \nLet\u2019s take me. A guy sees me, likes me, sets up a Super PAC. I don\u2019t talk to him. I don\u2019t do anything. \nI think we had either 9 or 5 or 11. We don\u2019t even know. They\u2019re all over the place. Trump, Trump \u2013 one of them called The Art of the Deal PAC after the book. \nThey have all these PACs. And the money comes in. And what do they do with the money? I don\u2019t know. \nAnd we aren\u2019t supposed to call them or anything. Okay. \nSo, we wrote a letter \u2013 a legal letter \u2013 to I think either 9 or 11 last week saying we don\u2019t want their money, send it back because again, what do they do with it? If some guy that\u2019s having a hard time all of a sudden has $2 million sitting in a Super PAC, do you think he\u2019s going to take ads for Trump? Maybe and maybe not. \nSo we sent them a \u2013 it\u2019s a scam, Super PACs, a scam. It\u2019s a disgrace that we have. A disgrace. \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you I read a number with, as an example, with Ben. Ben is paying 70 to almost 80 cents on the dollar to raise money. So when you read he has all this money, he\u2019s paying a lot of money and that\u2019s not reflected yet. So when you hear they raised $20 million, they\u2019re paying \u2013 now think of it, who pays \u2013 the number I actually heard was 79 but you know these guys will check them so I\u2019m telling you it may be off but you all know it\u2019s a lot. \nI think they said, 79 cents on the dollar. Think of it. To raise the money, they take 79 cents before they get to use the money for what it was supposed to be. Somebody is making a fortune. \nI know in Romney\u2019s campaign, a couple of guys walked away with millions and millions of dollars. Millions. They became rich raising money. It\u2019s better than being a real estate broker. \nFor the people and real estate brokers, they take these massive percentages of the money they raise. It\u2019s a scam. It\u2019s a scam. \nNow, in Ben\u2019s case, his Super PAC is running Iowa. And let me tell you, the people that are running that Super PAC, even if it comes in small donations, those are the real bosses. Those are the bosses. \nIn the case of Jeb Bush, you\u2019re not supposed to deal with these Super PACs. Okay? So, it was in the Wall Street Journal the other day. He has a Super PAC fundraiser or something in a hotel and right next to it, he had his campaign ballroom. Did you read that? Two ballrooms. One here, one here, right next to each other by coincidence, of course. They\u2019re not supposed to be coordination. They\u2019re not supposed to be talking. They\u2019re right next to each other. And that\u2019s nothing compared to what some are doing. \nIt\u2019s a scam and it should be stopped. And it\u2019s unfair to somebody like me that is spending my own money. \nPeople say, \u201cMr. Trump, what\u2019s your attitude on ISIS? When will you attack them? Where? \nI say \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t want to talk \u2013 I have a real chance of winning. I don\u2019t want to tell you what my attitude. I want them to guess. I don\u2019t really want to tell you.\u201d \nI mean, the one bad thing about our system, we have a system that got flaws. Let\u2019s face it. Hey, look at our leadership, it\u2019s got flaws. \nBut you know the one bad thing? When I gave that answer, they say \u2013 although some people \u2013 I see it here \u2013 some people say \u201cWe love that. We love that.\u201d But when I give that answer, some people say \u201cOh, Trump doesn\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t give an answer as to exactly what he\u2019s going to do. Exactly what he\u2019s going to do.\u201d \nAnd I know exactly what I\u2019m going to do and eventually after I was asked the question by 10 different reporters, all of whom are here tonight by the way, I said, \u201cYou know, here\u2019s the problem. If I don\u2019t give the answer, I\u2019m not going to win because they write so incredibly negatively. So if I don\u2019t give the answer, I\u2019m not going to win.\u201d They\u2019re going to say \u201cTrump wouldn\u2019t give us the answer.\u201d \nThey don\u2019t know it\u2019s unpredictability. They don\u2019t know it\u2019s strategy. \nAnd I said for a period of time like a month, I said \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you because I actually have a chance because from the time I announced, I\u2019ve been on the top of the polls, almost at the top. You know, we\u2019re doing well.\u201d \nIowa, will you get your numbers up please? Would you get these numbers up? I promise you I would do such a good job. \nFirst of all, I am a great Christian and I am. I am. Remember that. \nAnd I do well with the evangelicals. But the evangelicals left me down a little bit just last month. I don\u2019t know what I did. \nBut I am a great Christian. I\u2019m a believer and I believe in the Bible. And I even brought my Bible a month ago to a group signed by my mother, Mary, and with the address and the date \u2013 I won\u2019t tell you what date it was because possibly you\u2019d think I\u2019m younger than that. But she didn\u2019t want anybody taking my Bible because that was very important to her. \nSo cute. She has the address, has the date. But I said to myself, \u201cYou know \u2013 \u201c \nBy the way, before I forget, will you get the numbers up Iowa please? This is ridiculous. I mean, what is my competition? In all fairness, in all fairness, what is my competition? \nDo you think these guys \u2013 I\u2019m not going to say Carson \u2013 I\u2019m not going to say Rubio, who really is way down \u2013 I mean, I am second. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s terrible. But I don\u2019t like being second. Second is terrible to me. \nBut do you think that Ben is going to go to China? These guys are fierce. Like they\u2019d come into your office. I\u2019ve made many deals with China. I\u2019ve had great victories in terms of deals with China. They come into your office. There\u2019s no \u201cHello. How are you? It\u2019s a wonderful day.\u201d They come in \u2013 \u201cWe want deal.\u201d There\u2019s no games. I do this for a living. I\u2019m really good at it, folks. Really good. \nAnd you know, when you talk about energy, I\u2019ll tell you one thing, everybody agrees \u2013 oh, do I have energy. Oh. I toss and turn thinking about how I\u2019m going to make the best deal for you folks. I\u2019ll be tossing and turning. I will be tossing and turning. You\u2019re going to have so many deals that is so good for you. We\u2019re going to have numbers are going to be so good. \nI always joke you may get tired of them but then I always take that back because nobody gets tired of winning. \nWe don\u2019t win anymore. You know, think about it. Do we win at all? Ever? \nWe lose with the military. ISIS beats us. Everybody. \nWe lose with trade. \nWhen are we going to come back and say, \u201cWe beat China\u201d on a deal? When are we going to come back, \u201cWe beat Japan\u201d? \nDo you know that everybody said \u201cOh, Japan. They have so power over us. They have so much power because we owe them $1.5 trillion and they send all those cars.\u201d \nThey have no power. If we ever say, \u201cListen, if you\u2019re not going to treat us fairly, we don\u2019t want your cars anymore\u201d, they\u2019d go out of business, folks, they\u2019re gone. \nSame thing with China. China is not even doing that well. But they just lowered, they just devalued their currency. The biggest in two decades. And the reason they did it, they could never thought but we have so many other problems that they felt, \u201cOh wow, we can get away with this and it\u2019s going to make it impossible.\u201d \nDid you see the results yesterday of Caterpillar Tractor? Horrible. Because they\u2019re not getting stuff out because everybody \u2013 Japan and China in particular \u2013 is devaluing their currency. That\u2019s their number one weapon. And the stupid trade deal that we\u2019re making doesn\u2019t even cover it. That\u2019s their number one weapon and the trade that we\u2019re making doesn\u2019t cover it. \nAnd they asked a certain general, I\u2019m not going to insult him. It was like a month and a half ago. On a show. A talk show. I said here\u2019s general so and so, one of the top, top, top people. I said what\u2019s he doing on television? And he\u2019s saying \u201cWell, ISIS is very tough. You know, they spread out.\u201d \nBy the way, they took the oil that I said take. Remember I said \u201cTake the oil\u201d? Always take the oil! They\u2019re being funded by the oil that I said take. \nI don\u2019t want their damned oil. But you know what? It turned out to be another benefit of having it. Take the oil. And we didn\u2019t do it. \nWe shouldn\u2019t have been in Iraq in the first place. And I said that in 2003. Shouldn\u2019t have been there. \nWe totally destabilized the Middle East. We totally blew it. \nBut we were there. Then Obama announces because he\u2019s so predictable \u201cWe are leaving on a certain date in a year.\u201d \nRight? I couldn\u2019t believe. I was sitting there thinking \u201cDid he really say that?\u201d \nHe said \u201cWe will have all troops out by a certain date.\u201d Right? Did he say that? \nI said \u201cNo, no, tell me please.\u201d \n...Oh, you know what another one I got high marks on from every poll? Military. They think I\u2019ll be the best in the military because they say I \u2013 you know, I always say I\u2019ll be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I will. But everybody knows that, especially God. Everybody knows that. \nBut you know what I\u2019ll be? I\u2019ll be the great at the military. I\u2019ll be so good. And I\u2019ll know when \u2013 and I\u2019ll build our military so strong, so tough, so incredible, nobody\u2019s going to mess around. We\u2019re never going to have to use it. We\u2019re never going to have to use it. \nAnd I\u2019m going to take care of our vets. Believe me, they\u2019re our greatest people and our vets are not being treated as well as illegal immigrants. I\u2019m going to take care of our vets. \nSo go back. So the world is unpredictable. \nI made a business deal a year ago. And the guy \u2013 oh, I beat him so badly. Aye, it was so beautiful. It was a beautiful thing. It was like a picture. For me, it was like a picture. That\u2019s my own problem. I guess. But to me it\u2019s like a painting when you could do something like that. \nSo I made this deal and it was great. And they called. They did a story on me recently and it was a nice story. And I said, I hope they don\u2019t call this guy. They ended up calling this guy \u201cWhat do you think about Trump?\u201d And he said but in a respectful way, he said \u201cHe won because he was so damn unpredictable. We don\u2019t know what the hell he was going to do.\u201d That\u2019s a positive. That\u2019s a positive. \nI mean, if you\u2019re a poker player and you\u2019re predictable, you\u2019re not going home with much money. Okay? \nBut it was really \u2013 I said, \u201cThat\u2019s not nice what he said.\u201d First, I said \u201cThat\u2019s not nice. I\u2019m unpredictable.\u201d Then I said, \u201cWait a minute. He meant that as a compliment.\u201d And I called him. I said, \u201cWhat did you mean by that?\u201d He said \u201cI think that\u2019s the greatest compliment I can pay. We could not figure you out. You came at us from 15 different angles.\u201d \nSo with Obama, when he announces that we\u2019re leaving Iraq on a certain date, we shouldn\u2019t have been there but once you announced the bad guys \u2013 you know how they say the surge worked? You know why the surge worked? You know why? Because the bad guys all moved back. They said, \u201cHey, what do we have to get killed for?\u201d I mean, these people don\u2019t mind being killed, can you believe it? But they said \u201cIf we don\u2019t have to, let\u2019s not.\u201d So they moved back. \nAnd they said, \u201cHey, they\u2019re leaving in -\u201c What was the date? Do you remember the date? Specific date to the day. \u201cWe will have all troops out. I\u2019m a great president.\u201d \nSo the bad guys, meaning the opponents, whatever you want to call them, they just said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re leaving in a year. Going to have all the troops out. Let\u2019s go back. Why do we have to be shot at for the next year? And what do we have to do because if we do well maybe he\u2019ll change his mind and stay. So let\u2019s let him think he has this great victory with the surge.\u201d Right? \u201cThe surge worked!\u201d \nWhat happened was that everybody pulled back. They said, \u201cLet\u2019s wait.\u201d \nNow we leave because of a lack of leadership. We leave and boom it comes apart. That\u2019s what happened. That was the surge. \nEverybody talk so much \u2013 \u201cOh, the surge was so great.\u201d The surge was great because everybody knew \u2013 they knew what was happening. They knew it was going to happen. They knew we were leaving even through Bush. \nI mean, honestly, they knew we were leaving. They were fed up. So they pulled back and they said, \u201cLet\u2019s get them out.\u201d Everybody wanted to leave. \nNow, I would have done it differently. Even if I wanted to leave and I might or I might not. I won\u2019t even say. \nIf I brought it to $100 billion a year, get rid of me in four years, all right? \nBut suppose we brought it back to $100 billion or we brought it back to zero, do you know what that means to this country? Do you know the kind of money you\u2019re talking about? Then jobs will start coming back, lots of good things would happen. Lots of great things would happen. \nAnd maybe our babies who have all these toys all over the place, maybe they\u2019ll have 75% and maybe they\u2019ll like them better. Maybe they\u2019ll be better. And they\u2019ll be manufactured here. \nWhenever I order television sets, I ordered thousands and thousands of television sets a year for different jobs. And whenever I order them, they all come from South Korea. They make all the television \u2013 other than Sony but Sony has sort of lost its way a little bit. Sony is Japan. \nBut South Korea \u2013 LG, Samsung. I don\u2019t get bids from American. I\u2019d love to. I\u2019d love to. \nGeorge Will said there\u2019s a company in South Carolina that makes television. I said where are they? I\u2019d like to have a good name too by the way. It\u2019s important. You know, when somebody\u2019s paying you a fortune for a hotel room, it\u2019s nice to see a good name. Right? Do we agree? \nWell, it\u2019s a company in South Carolina but they don\u2019t make them there; they assemble them. They\u2019ll order parts that come in and they\u2019ll assemble them. But much different. \nBut I\u2019d love it if we made them. \nBut you take South Korea. We defend South Korea for essentially nothing. You have the maniac over in North Korea that nobody ever talks about by the way. Now, he really has nuclear weapons and we don\u2019t talk about him. \nWe made the worst deal ever made with Iran. Right? The worst. \nThese are the people that represent \u2013 these people are incompetent. Or stupid. Somebody said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say stupid. It\u2019s not nice.\u201d But it\u2019s true. They\u2019re stupid. I think. I mean, I think. Unless I don\u2019t know is there something going on that we don\u2019t know about? \nThink of it. Point after point, we lost. We lost everything. We\u2019ve given them $150 billion. Hard to believe. They don\u2019t have to develop \u2013 I was telling somebody they don\u2019t have to develop nuclear weapon; they can buy it. \nWhat the hell why should they develop it? They can buy it. And now all of a sudden they\u2019re going into Syria. They got so much money. They\u2019re a terrorist state. They\u2019re going into all of these different places. We\u2019re fighting them in Yemen and yet we\u2019re making a deal with them. \nSo why don\u2019t you say \u201cHey, Yemen out\u201d? Our prisoners \u2013 I want them back. I want them back. I don\u2019t want them over there. I want them back. \nAnd all we have to do, very simple, is if you have the right messenger. I\u2019m the right messenger. You know, I\u2019ve gotten to a point where I have to be braggadocious. It\u2019s terrible. Right? Because I can\u2019t be so nice and say \u201cWe can all do a wonderful job\u201d. People can\u2019t do those kind of stuff. \nFor instance, the wall. I said, I guarantee you that we\u2019re going to build a wall. It\u2019s going to be a real wall. We\u2019re going to have people come through and they\u2019re going to come through legally. Or they\u2019re going to come through with visas, which is a safe way, if we need it. \nAnd we want people to come through. I want people to come through. I don\u2019t want to say no. \nBut we have at least 11 million \u2013 you know, the scary thing is nobody has any idea how many. You know, we\u2019ve been hearing that number for years. You know, like 11 million. We have no idea. I spoke to one of the top people. They have no idea. Might be 5 million. Might also be 32 million. Could be 50 [million]... \nBut we have to get them out. We have to \u2013 look, it\u2019s harsh. \nDwight Eisenhower \u2013 we all like Dwight. Right? Remember the expression. Right? \nI go remember he got elected \u2013 \u201cI like Ike\u201d. How could he be bad? All right? And I think he was a nicer general than MacArthur and Patton. And I like Ike as a president but I love Patton and I love General MacArthur. I love them. And we\u2019re going to find ourselves a Patton and we\u2019re going to find ourselves because we have a lot of smart guys in our military and women. We\u2019re going to find ourselves a Patton...But we\u2019re going to find a Patton and we\u2019re going to find a MacArthur. And I\u2019m really good at that. We\u2019re going to find great people. \nAnd I\u2019ve told this story where I watched these generals go on television \u2013 they shouldn\u2019t be on television. They shouldn\u2019t be talking. You know? They shouldn\u2019t be talking. They should be doing. \nHonestly, nobody else even knows about it. The other candidates, most of them don\u2019t even know about it. It\u2019s not their wheelhouse. Okay? It\u2019s not their thing. It\u2019s not their thing. \nTheir thing is getting re-elected. That\u2019s what they\u2019re good at. They get re-elected. And they make promises and they\u2019re all talk and they\u2019re no action. And the same things happen with these politicians. It\u2019s always the same. \nSo we have so many different things and what I\u2019ve done with our tax plan, which something I\u2019m very proud of, we\u2019ve brought it down to a few groups. \nBecause right now, you have to go out \u2013 people who aren\u2019t doing well go out and hire companies to help them with their tax plans. They\u2019ll pay $500, $1,000 because it\u2019s so complicated. \nAnd we\u2019re going to make it nice and simple. \nAnd we\u2019re getting rid of carried interest, which is something that a lot of rich hedge fund guys love. But we\u2019re getting rid of it. They don\u2019t love me so much anymore. But I don\u2019t care. \nAnd we\u2019re getting rid of a lot of things. \nSo we\u2019re going to have a nice simple tax return. \nSomebody said \u201cOh, why isn\u2019t everybody paying?\u201d \nYou know, 40% \u2013 a big percentage \u2013 will not pay any tax at all. People that are doing badly. \nThey said \u2013 well, I won\u2019t use the candidates\u2019 name because I don\u2019t want to insult any candidate when they can\u2019t defend themselves. They said \u201cWe want everybody to pay at least something.\u201d And I said, \u201cI agree.\u201d \nHere\u2019s the problem. From the standpoint of bookkeeping, from the standpoint of bureaucracy, you\u2019re talking about millions and millions of returns. You\u2019re talking about building the IRS even bigger and it\u2019s a monster. And I could cut it down way down. And the money that you\u2019re talking about is far less than the administrative costs. \nSo I said, \u201cI agree. Except for one thing from a practical standpoint, it\u2019s too much. Most of these people aren\u2019t paying anyway.\u201d \nWhat I want to do is bring our jobs back from China, bring our jobs back from Mexico, bring fairness to our deals as an example with Japan. \nI was in Los Angeles. Ships \u2013 the biggest ships you\u2019ve ever seen. Cars are pouring off into this country. Made in Japan. We give them practically nothing. \nThe balance is so bad. The imbalance is so bad. And then we have all the strikes. \nSee, what our people don\u2019t know and only somebody that wrote \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d or does this stuff. It\u2019s natural. It\u2019s like a great athlete. Like a Jack Nicklaus. He was always able to sink that putt. Right? You know, he\u2019s just better. And you have athletes \u2013 very few \u2013 but there are some people that have a certain ability. \nA lot of people don\u2019t even know we have all the power. We have all the power in China. \nYou know, we owe right now China and Japan equally $1.5 \u2013 think of this \u2013 trillion. $1.5 trillion. Think of this. They take our business and in the case of Japan, mostly cars. But they take our business. They take our jobs. Factories close down all over the place. And we owe them money. Right? It\u2019s a magic act. For them not for us. For us it\u2019s a horror show. \nIt\u2019s going to end. It\u2019s going to end. \nAnd people like Carl Icahn and the people like the best negotiators \u2013 I know the best negotiators in the world. Some I think are horrible people. I\u2019ll be honest with you. I don\u2019t care. Do you care if they\u2019re horrible people? Who cares? \nNow, Carl happens to be actually a very nice guy but he\u2019s a brilliant negotiator and a tough cookie and he\u2019s built a fortune. He doesn\u2019t want money. He doesn\u2019t want to say, \u201cOh, give me $200,000 a year in government money.\u201d He wants to do it. He\u2019s proud to do it. He wants to help the country. And it\u2019s so easy for him. \nFor instance, if I say \u201cCarl, do me a favor. The trade deal we have with China is so unfair we\u2019re losing $400 billion a year. Carl, do me a favor. Make it fair.\u201d I don\u2019t have to give him a big speech. I don\u2019t have to give him a big speech. \nI mean, I can tell you that within a very, very short period of time, things will straighten out. I mean, things will straighten out and it\u2019s going to be our benefit. \nBut think of it, if we\u2019re losing that kind of money \u2013 that imbalance. It\u2019s an imbalance. Some people will say \u201cThat\u2019s not really a loss.\u201d It is a loss. If we have that kind of imbalance and suppose you brought it back to zero or even if we lost $100 billion a year, that\u2019s a lot of money. Believe me, I couldn\u2019t sleep. \nBut you know, we have an agreement with Japan and I love Japan. I love China. I love all these people. But their leaders are killing us because they\u2019re smarter, sharper, more cunning. \nThe leaders of Mexico are killing us at the border and in trade. They\u2019re taking so many of our companies. \nEven Nabisco \u2013 my Oreos \u2013 they\u2019re taking Nabisco. Right? I\u2019m never eating Oreos. I tell it all the time. They had some Oreos before on the plane and I said I don\u2019t want to touch them. Bring them back. I yelled out to bring them back. \nBut I\u2019m not happy. They\u2019re leaving Chicago and they\u2019re moving their big plant to Mexico. \nSo when you see this happening, we have to stop it. \nAnd I\u2019m not going to beat around the bush and \u201cOh, let\u2019s talk and let\u2019s be nice and let\u2019s say \u2013 \u201c Nobody can do it like I do it. Nobody. Honestly, nobody. \nWe can \u2013 I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m perfect because I\u2019m not perfect. Nobody\u2019s perfect... \nNow, nobody\u2019s perfect. But I\u2019ll tell you when it comes to that stuff I\u2019m really \u2013 there\u2019s nobody better. \nCarl Icahn endorsed me the other day. He\u2019s one of the great traders, one of the great dealmakers. He says Trump, Trump. And he\u2019s not somebody that just do it. He wants somebody that knows what they\u2019re doing. He understand. \nYou talk about corporate inversions and all of the things that have been going on. \nCorporate inversions. You know, many of the companies in this country have trillions of dollars cumulatively. They think $2.5 trillion overseas right now. They can\u2019t get it in. \nAnd everybody agrees that we should bring it in. The Democrats and the Republicans. They\u2019ve agreed for years. They can\u2019t make a deal because they have no leader. \nIt\u2019s not like \u201cOh gee, we disagree on Obamacare. Or we disagree on something else.\u201d \nAlthough I must tell you many of the Democrats that I speak to because I\u2019m friendly with all of them. I\u2019m friendly with like Republicans. I get a long with everybody. \nYou know, everybody says \u201cOh, you won\u2019t be a unifier\u201d. I\u2019ll be the greatest unifier of all. Why is Obama a unifier? \nBut I will tell you many of the Democrats who voted for Obamacare would never have done it now and were lied to 28 times. Right? \u201cYou can keep your doctor, keep your plan, keep your this, everything\u2019s going to be great.\u201d Turned out to be a total lie. 28 different times that they know of and they wouldn\u2019t have done it. \nBut when you look at what\u2019s happening with corporations and the highest tax \u2013 we pay the highest tax anywhere in the world of any country \u2013 but they have trillions of dollars overseas. And these are great companies in many cases. They have thousands of employees. They can\u2019t get their money back. \nAnd the reason is bureaucracy. It\u2019s very hard. \nAnd also big reason the tax is too high. They don\u2019t want to bring $1 million back and pay $300,000 or $350,000 tax. They\u2019d rather leave it over there. \nAnd if they bring it back, they\u2019ll be using it to invest in our country. I mean, a lot of good things will happen. \nI happen to believe it\u2019s more than $2.5 trillion. \nBut here\u2019s the thing and I use it because it\u2019s so incredible. Here\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s not controversial. It\u2019s not like you have the Republicans here and you have \u2013 everybody agrees. They\u2019ve agreed you know that for 2.5, 3 years. They can\u2019t make a deal. \nAnd now what\u2019s happening and this will be the next great story is companies are leaving the United States \u2013 two reasons \u2013 lower taxes but also to get their money. They\u2019ve got billions of dollars overseas. They\u2019re leaving our country in order to get their money and in order to pay lower tax. \nAnd you\u2019re talking about one company I know of \u2013 I don\u2019t know how much they\u2019ve written about it \u2013 but you\u2019re talking about 6,000 jobs just one company. You\u2019re talking about potentially thousands of companies. \nAnd I say it, in the old days, they\u2019d leave New York. People would move down and companies would move down to Florida or they\u2019d move to Texas or they\u2019d leave New Jersey, where taxes are quite high, and they\u2019d move to another location. Right? Now, they leave our country and they go to other countries. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened. \nIn the world of the Internet and the world of very fast jets, it\u2019s a different world out there. \nAnd there\u2019s no loyalty. They\u2019re paid a lot of money to make a lot of money for their shareholders and some of them are actually foreign; they\u2019d like to move back to these countries. \nThey bring in executives that are from Ireland, from other places. And they don\u2019t mind. They don\u2019t have loyalty to the United States. \nSo my plan, my tax plan, is something I\u2019m very proud of. We\u2019re going to solve corporate inversion. \nI\u2019ll tell you what, we will have that money back \u2013 if I get elected president, that money will be back so fast your head will spin. Nobody else will be able to do it. Nobody. \nAnd I have to tell you legal \u2013 you come in and we\u2019re going to have a good time and you\u2019re going to be there and you\u2019re going to do great \u2013 and visas \u2013 maybe work, maybe there are cases where you need people in and we\u2019ll do something, we\u2019re not going to hurt our economy in any way, shape or form. We\u2019re going to make our economy much, much stronger. \nBut we\u2019re also going to get jobs for people that are here. People with us. We\u2019re going to get jobs. We\u2019re going to get jobs. \nBut the illegal immigration \u2013 you know, I did this and I made my determination \u2013 I took a deep breath. Because I\u2019ll tell you what, it takes courage to say I\u2019m going to run for president. It really does, especially in my case where I have a great business and I love my business. I love doing it. I may never even see it. \nI mean, I own some of the great properties in the world. Doral in Miami. I may never see it again... Turnberry in Scotland, one of the greatest homes of the British Open and all of that. I may never see it again. \nAll of these incredible places that I have. \nBut more than that, it takes courage because when you do it, you\u2019re putting yourself out there beyond anything that anybody\u2019s done and it even takes courage for a politician to do it. \nNow at some point some of these guys have to leave. Don\u2019t we agree? It\u2019s getting ridiculous. \nBecause like tomorrow night we\u2019re having a debate, and I wish we had more time for the debate. Not in terms of three hours because who wants three hours? You know, I could stand up for 20 hours if I had to but who wants to watch that long? \nHillary\u2019s debate essentially lasted for an hour and a half and I was \u2013 oh \u2013 it was \u2013 you couldn\u2019t watch it. \nYou have Hillary against a socialist/communist. And honestly, he\u2019s not going to win. Just so you understand...He\u2019s not going to win and neither is she... \nWell, she\u2019s being totally protected because in theory she shouldn\u2019t even be allowed to run. She\u2019s being protected. \nIt\u2019s a tough game and it\u2019s a nasty game but she\u2019s being totally protected. \nBut she\u2019s going to beat him and you still have one more of these guys. O\u2019Malley. So he\u2019ll be out quickly, I guess. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s he doing. What do they do when they have zero? They have zero. \nAnd I wouldn\u2019t say it against our folks. But they\u2019ve treated me \u2013 some of the zeroes have treated me so nastily, right? Because they want to start controversy and they want to try pick up some points. \nAnd you know what? I\u2019m not going to even mention names. Usually I do. I love doing it. But everybody that\u2019s hit me so far has gone down. They\u2019ve gone down. And they\u2019ve gone down bigly. \nAnd a couple of the ones and zeroes \u2013 they\u2019re the ones that hit the hardest. I mean, they\u2019re like desperate people. But they hit. \nOne of them has a zero with an arrow pointing to the left. That means less than zero. And I don\u2019t understand. What does it mean? I assume it\u2019s a typo but maybe not. \nBut when you look at the things that are happening with our country \u2013 the trade situation with not just China \u2013 I talk about China all the time because that\u2019s the main abuser, that\u2019s the biggest abuser. The numbers are astronomical. Almost $400 billion a year in terms of imbalance. Think of it \u2013 $400 billion a year. \nAnd they send stuff over here but we can\u2019t send stuff over there. They tax us. Big tax. \nA friend of mine can\u2019t get stuff over there. The tax is so big. Big tax. \nSomebody bought an airplane in China here. Can\u2019t get it over there. Spoiled guy. Rich guy. Bought a beautiful plane. Can\u2019t get it over there because the tax is so massive that he\u2019s now selling in this country because China won\u2019t let him have the plane and he has to pay a tax. \nI won\u2019t even tell you what the tax is. It\u2019s so astronomical that I don\u2019t even believe them myself. So I\u2019m not going to say it because those guys will say \u201cWell, he was wrong.\u201d All I can tell you is it\u2019s a massive tax. Like you don\u2019t buy planes here because if you do, you won\u2019t be able to get them back in. \nAnd here, we accept all of their products. \nSo we have almost a $400 billion trade imbalance with China. \nWe have a $70 billion trade imbalance with Japan. \nWe have a \u2013 you know, with all that\u2019s going on in the South China Sea and you look where we have a destroyer \u2013 a relatively small ship \u2013 over there, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d want to be the captain of that ship right now. But they\u2019re being sort of mocked and scorned and a lot of bad things can happen. \n...I was telling some of the folks backstage, I never ever thought we\u2019d do this well this fast. This has been so incredible. What\u2019s happened all over. What\u2019s happened in Iowa. It\u2019s been really incredible. \nWe\u2019ve had some amazing results and they continue to come in. \nGot a little shake-up in Iowa. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. \nSomebody said \u201cAre you going straight to New Hampshire?\u201d Now, I love New Hampshire. We\u2019ve got great numbers. 38 to 12. That\u2019s good. \nBut we fell a little behind in Iowa, and some people are saying how can it be. And I come out and I was just telling a group we have the biggest crowds, we have the most enthusiastic crowds. \nEverybody said and it\u2019s very true. I mean, look at this. Somebody else would come, they\u2019d have like 50 people and they wouldn\u2019t need this room. Believe me. \nBut everybody said without question in every poll \u2013 this isn\u2019t just here \u2013 that the people that are with Trump are with Trump. They don\u2019t go anywhere. They\u2019re staying. It\u2019s true. I see it. I see it. \nAnd we\u2019ve seen it. \nYou know, a couple of times I say \u201cWell, that could be the end.\u201d Then they do something and I\u2019m 10 points up. It\u2019s the craziest thing, right? But we\u2019ll take it. \nBut they say the people are with \u2013 we have the most loyal people by far. Everybody says it. \nThe other thing they say is for leadership, number one. Very important, right? Don\u2019t you think? Leadership. \nI mean, when leadership is number one \u2013 they say on the economy without question number one and by a lot. \nSo you know it\u2019s great. \nI thought I\u2019d talk a little bit and I want to take some questions. You know, we can do a little question and answer. Right? \nWe have all these cameras going back here. And you know, it\u2019s always tough when you\u2019re on live television all the time. \nLook, we have 10 topics. Right? How many topics? 10? How many different ways can you talk about the 10 topics? \nThe bottom line is we want results. We want to get it done. But when you\u2019re on live television all the time all those people back there and the cameras are on and then you\u2019re talking about immigration and you\u2019re talking about the wall because we\u2019re going to have a wall and we\u2019re going to stop illegal immigration. \nBut we talk about trade and we talk about repealing Obamacare. And we talk about all the things that we talk about. \nBut you know, you have these points and we could talk about them in different forms, in different ways and give different examples. But in the end, it\u2019s really about results. Isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s really about results. \nAnd you can only talk about the same subjects on live television so many different ways. \nI talk about industry. I talk about commerce. I talk about how we\u2019re losing our jobs to all of these different countries. And I give different examples. \nBut it\u2019s still going to be a certain number of subjects. \nI talk about Second Amendment. I talk about Fourteenth Amendment. We talk about amendments. \nYou know, that Second Amendment, they want to take it away from you. They really want to do things and it\u2019s not going to happen. It\u2019s not going to happen. At  least with me it\u2019s not going to happen. That I can tell you. \nSo I said today you know we\u2019ll talk for a little while but I want to do some questions and answers. I want you people to excite me for a change. Is that okay? I want to be excited. And so we\u2019re going to have some fun. We\u2019re going to do that. \nA few things \u2013 I want to bring up a few new subjects. \nSo, immigration, we\u2019re going to be doing a very strong number. It\u2019s killing us. It\u2019s killing us. And it\u2019s bad for the economy. It\u2019s bad for \u2013 all of this illegal immigration. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks in NYC", "text": "Question:\n[Inaudible]\n \nA lot of people think that she will not be able to make it legally from a criminal standpoint to the starting gate. I don\u2019t know that to be true. \nBut I think it depends on what happens with her. \nI think if she gets out, he will get in. I think if she stays in, he might not. \nWho knows? \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nSo I suggested frankly that I\u2019m fine with him not being here because I don\u2019t want anybody to think he\u2019s endorsing. \nAs far as Jeb is concerned, I watched him this morning on television and it\u2019s a little bit sad. \nDon\u2019t forget. He was supposed to win. And he just doesn\u2019t have the energy. \nBut what he does have is a lot of money that was given to him again by special interests, donors, and lobbyists. \nAnd I just hope that if he spends money on ads, which he may not \u2013 if I were him, I\u2019d spend money on positive ads about himself. Because if he knocks me, assuming people leave and maybe they\u2019re at a point where they\u2019re not going to leave because they\u2019re fed up with what\u2019s happening in this country, but I think they\u2019re going to go to people other than Jeb. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd I don\u2019t mean by number one. I mean like number one by many, many times. And I am so intent on putting people back to work in this country. \nYou know, we have 93 million people that are not in the workforce right now. 93 million. \nWhen they give up looking for a job, they take them off of the stats. They take them off the statistics. We have 93 million people. \nWe have 50 million people between poverty levels and welfare and all. \nOur country can be great again. We have to put people back to work. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nThe second part I won\u2019t bother asking you. It\u2019s no longer pertinent. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nSo, Kanye West \u2013 I love him. Now, maybe in a few years I\u2019ll have to run against him. I don\u2019t know. So I\u2019ll take that back. \nBut he\u2019s been so nice to me. \nYou people have sort of seen because I\u2019ve been a counter-puncher. I only hit people when they hit me. Only. And Kanye West has been so great. I would never say bad about him because he says such nice things about me. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nJapan is devaluing their yen. Very hard for Caterpillar and other companies to compete against Komatsu \u2013 their big tractor maker \u2013 and others. We\u2019re not going to let this happen anymore. \nThey do \u2013 you talk about a trade imbalance. They have in Japan the biggest ships you\u2019ve ever seen pouring cars into Los Angeles, pouring them in. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. We send them beef and they don\u2019t even want it. \nIt\u2019s going to end and they\u2019re going to like us. \nIn this building, I have the largest bank in the world. Right up these elevators. It\u2019s a bank from China. By far the biggest bank in the world. \nI get along great with China. I get along great with Japan. I get along great with Mexico. \nI love the people. I love the people of Mexico. I love the Hispanics. I have thousands of Hispanics right now working for me. Over the years, I have employed tens of thousands of Hispanics \u2013 many from Mexico. I have unbelievably great relationships. \nAnd in the package that we gave you, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a poll and I\u2019m number one with Hispanics. You saw that. Number one with Hispanics. \nSo, look, for our country to be great, we have to be able to make great deals. We\u2019re going to be great to the vets. We\u2019re going to be terrific. Our military is going to be unbelievable. \nAll of these things \u2013 we\u2019re going to get rid of Obamacare and come up with something that\u2019s much better and much less expensive. We\u2019re going to get rid of it. We\u2019re going to repeal it. It\u2019s going to be out. Should have been out a long time ago. Should have never happened. \nBut we are going to take care of our country and we are going to bring back jobs and we\u2019re going to bring back wealth to the United States so we can afford to save Social Security, which I\u2019ll save without cuts, so that we can afford to do the kind of things that we have to do to make America great again. \nLadies and gentlemen, thank you very much. And here is your pledge. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd just remember something, when it\u2019s a bubble...we can\u2019t be brought down by that bubble. They\u2019ve done things that caused it. We can\u2019t be brought down by that bubble. \nThank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI hear he\u2019s going to spend a lot of money on negative ads on me. \nAnd honestly, look, he\u2019s getting the money from special interests. He\u2019s getting the money from lobbyists and his donors. And they\u2019re making him do it because he\u2019s crashing in the polls. \nSo I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen if he spends $20 million or $25 million on negative ads \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I know that my life will continue. I just don\u2019t know. I mean nobody\u2019s ever spent money on ads against me. But he probably has to do that although it would not be the way I\u2019ve done. \nYou know, one of the things I\u2019m most honored about is that so far everybody that\u2019s attacked me has gone down the tubes. \nYou have Lindsey Graham attacked me. He was at 3%. Now he\u2019s at zero. \nYou have Perry attacked me. Now he\u2019s getting out of the race. He was at 4% or 5%. Now he\u2019s getting out of the race. He was at zero. \nEverybody \u2013 Rand Paul attacked me. I see the last poll \u2013 the Monmouth poll that just came out today where I\u2019m leading by double figures and Rand Paul is down to less than 2% and he attacked me. \nNow, Jeb Bush also just went down in the Monmouth poll very big. \nSo I don\u2019t know. Are they going to spend \u2013 he\u2019s going to spend lobbyist money and special interest money. Remember this \u2013 they have total control over Jeb and Hillary and everybody else that takes that money. \nNobody knows the system better than me. They have total control. \nYou understand it very well because you\u2019ve been covering it for a long time. Those people that are putting up those millions of dollars have total control over your candidate. \nI will tell you this: Nobody\u2019s putting up millions of dollars for me. I\u2019m putting up my own money. \nIn fact, I feel a little bit foolish. People are offering me millions and millions of dollars. You know, when you\u2019re in first place, you can collect so much money and I keep turning them down. I feel like \u2013 am I a fool? I feel very foolish. \nAnd when I was in Iowa last week, I said \u201cWhat do you think? Can I take \u2013 \u201c One man offered me \u2013 a big lobbyist \u2013 offered $5 million for my campaign. I said to the crowd in Iowa \u2013 great crowd, 4,000 people \u2013 I said \u201cCan I take it? And would you believe I\u2019m not going to do anything? I promise you. I swear to you I won\u2019t do anything.\u201d And they all stood up and said \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t take it.\u201d \nThe fact is I\u2019m the only self-funder. I\u2019m putting up my own money. \nI know there have been some super PACs \u2013 5 or 6 super PACs \u2013 where people are forming super PACs for Trump. I have nothing to do with them. As you know, you\u2019re not allowed to have anything to do with them. So I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do. \nHopefully, if they\u2019re going to do something it\u2019s going to be nice. But I don\u2019t know anything about them. \nBut just in a nutshell, I\u2019m funding my own campaign. Nobody else\u2019s. \nWhen people advertise \u2013 and I hope the voters can see this. Every negative ad they see about me is paid for by lobbyists and special interests. So just remember that. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWe have nuclear weapons that you look at 60 Minutes they don\u2019t even work. Okay? If anybody saw that report. The phones don\u2019t work. They\u2019re 40 years old. They have wires that are no good. \nNothing works. Our country doesn\u2019t work. \nEverybody wins except us. We need victories in this country. We don\u2019t have victories any more. \nOur country will be great again, but right now our country has major problems. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nI don\u2019t like the fact that there are 11 people now as I understand it. They\u2019re not getting rid of Rand Paul or somebody. But I think they should because there\u2019s too many people. \nBecause when you have 11, you\u2019re not getting to hear me and you\u2019re not getting to hear other people talking and I think that\u2019s too bad. I think 11 is a lot of people. \nBut I was very happy that she got into the debate because frankly she deserves to be in the debate.\n... \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nFor those of you who don\u2019t know him, he\u2019s a very honorable and an honest guy and a truly great athlete. He is really a very good friend of mine. \nAnd I just spoke to him a little while ago. He\u2019s so thrilled and so happy. \nTom Brady \u2013 I think what they\u2019ve done is terrible. And he\u2019s been exonerated as I understand it because I just heard about it. But I\u2019m very happy for Tom. \nAs far as the Commissioner is concerned, they\u2019re having a rough year. Let\u2019s face it. They\u2019re having a very rough year. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd I just say this. This United States has tremendous problems of their own. We have infrastructure that we have to fix. We have bridges and roads and tunnels and everything is falling apart. Our nation\u2019s in such trouble. \nThat\u2019s why being a builder and a great builder and a very successful builder I think will greatly help. \nBut we have so many of our own problems including the border, including the wall, which we will get built, including all of the things we have \u2013 health care, which is a mess. \nYou know, if you look at Obamacare, the premiums have gone up 45%, 50%, 55%. People are saying \u201cThis is turning out to be a disaster.\u201d Deductibles are through the roof. The deductibles on Obamacare it\u2019s through the roof. \nSo we have a lot of problems. We have to take care of our vets. We have to build up our military. \nJust the other day, Gen. [Ray] Ordierno said that the Army is in the worst shape in its history in terms of preparedness. \nNow, for them to be in bad shape with the way we are and with the world hating us, and you look at Hillary Clinton \u2013 and I\u2019ve said she\u2019s the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country. \nNow, in all fairness, because of the agreement that\u2019s about to be finalized with Iran, John Kerry may very well take her place. \nI think that agreement is a disaster for this country, for Israel, for the Middle East. It\u2019s going to lead to nuclear proliferation \u2013 the 24-day clause \u2013 everything about it. We don\u2019t even get our prisoners back. You say who negotiates a thing like that? \nThat won\u2019t happen, I can guarantee you, with a President Trump. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nYou see, I was always the fair hair boy. I was a big contributor. Nobody knows the system. But I was on the other side. And I was the elite. I was the fair hair person. \nOnce I ran, all of a sudden I was a little bit of an outsider. I became an outsider because I was running. Because I wasn\u2019t supposed to run. \nI\u2019m this businessman that people have given me great credit as being a great businessman. But I\u2019m not supposed to be running for office. \nThe fact is that our country is being killed on trade by China, by Japan, by Mexico both at the border and on trade. \nAnd I\u2019m not knocking those countries. Their leaders are much, much smarter than our leaders. They are absolutely killing us. \nChina \u2013 taking our jobs, taking our money, taking our base. And think of this: We owe China $1.4 trillion and we\u2019re paying them interest. \nWe owe Japan with all of the cars coming in the same amount \u2013 $1.4 trillion. \nNow, that\u2019s like a magic act. They send the cars in, they take our jobs, they do everything, and we owe them money. That\u2019s not going to happen with me. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd when people come into the country illegally, we should not allow that. \nAnd this is not from South America. This is not from Mexico. This is from all over the world. \nWhen people come illegally, we cannot allow that. \nAnd I want people to come legally. I want very much to take care of our border because our southern border is a total mess. That\u2019s been proven. \nAnd interestingly, a couple of months ago when I announced, I made some very strong statements about the crime and the problems that were happening and I\u2019ve been proven right. \nAnd many of the people in this audience actually have apologized to me, which I very much appreciate. Of course, they haven\u2019t done it publicly but these are minor details but someday they will. \nThe fact is that we are a nation that wants and needs borders. We\u2019re a nation that wants and needs and is based on laws. \nAnd we will make sure that that takes place. \nWith that being said, I want people to come into our country legally. I want to have a big, fat beautiful open door. I want people of great talent to come in for Silicon Valley. I want engineers. I want physicists. I want people with great talent to come into the United States. \nWhen people graduate from college, you can be number one in your class at Harvard or number one at Yale or the Wharton School of Finance or Princeton or Stanford. And immediately if you\u2019re not a citizen of the United States, you get thrown out of the country. We want those people to stay. \nWe want people of great talent to be in the United States to work here and ultimately to become a citizen. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nDon\u2019t forget if I didn\u2019t bring up the subject of illegal immigration, you wouldn\u2019t be asking the question. Nobody would be even talking about immigration. And immigration and in particular illegal immigration has become a very big factor. \nNow, a lot of bad things have happened with respect to crime since I brought it up. \nBut if I didn\u2019t bring it up, immigration would not even be a subject that we\u2019re talking about and it happens to be a very important subject. \nI have to say this: It can also be a very positive subject because I believe so strongly in immigration and I just \u2013 we have to stop illegal immigration and we have to look forward to great immigration done in a legal manner. \nBut if I didn\u2019t bring it up, nobody would be talking about it. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nSigning executive orders it not the way our country was supposed to be run. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd this is going to be a campaign like I think no other. \nI\u2019m not controlled by lobbyists. I\u2019m not controlled by anybody. I\u2019m controlled by the people of the country in order to make our country great again. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nThe question was what did I get for signing the pledge? Absolutely nothing. Other than the assurance that I would be treated fairly. And I\u2019ve seen that over the last two months. They really have been very fair. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nNobody thought I was going to run and they said \u201cOh, he won\u2019t run and he won\u2019t put in his papers. And he wouldn\u2019t do all of this.\u201d \nI did that. The papers in terms of the company turned out to be spectacular. It\u2019s a great company. I built a great company. And all of the other papers have turned out to be very well received. \nAnd I think the thing that\u2019s changed is the fact that I went to number one place very quickly after I signed and after I in this building notified everybody that I\u2019d be running for President. \nSo I think the biggest thing is that I went early to number one and the RNC has treated me with great respect. \nSo that was very important. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd that\u2019s how people that don\u2019t speak \u2013 and I\u2019m not just talking about Spanish; I\u2019m talking about from various parts of the world \u2013 that\u2019s how they will become successful and do great. \nSo I think it\u2019s more appropriate to be speaking English. \nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you all for being here. This is some turnout. My great honor. \nThe Chairman just left as you probably know and he\u2019s been extremely fair. The RNC has been absolutely terrific over the last two month period. \nAnd as you know, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve wanted. I wanted fairness. \nI don\u2019t have to be treated any differently than anybody else. I just wanted fairness from the Republican Party. \nWe\u2019re leading in every single poll. A new poll came out today where we\u2019re over 30%. We\u2019ve actually hit numbers as high as 35% and 40%. \nAnd frankly, I\u2019ve felt that the absolute best way to win and to beat the Democrats and very easily I think beat the Democrats no matter who it may be whether it\u2019s Hillary or anybody else and I think maybe Hillary is going to have a very hard time frankly with what\u2019s happening getting to the starting gate, the best way for the Republicans to win is if I win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up. \nAnd for that reason, I have signed the pledge. \nSo I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands and we will go out and we will fight hard and we will win. We will win. \nAnd most importantly, we will make our country great again because that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. We have to make our country great again. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trumps\u2019s speech following the New Hampshire primary", "text": "We\u2019re going to build a wall. It\u2019s going to be built. It\u2019s not even \u2013 believe it or not, it\u2019s not even a difficult thing to do. \nAnd by the way, for the people of New Hampshire where you have a tremendous problem with heroin and drugs, you won\u2019t even believe it. You see this place and you say it\u2019s so beautiful. You have a tremendous problem. The first thing always that they always mentioned to me, \u201cMr. Trump, please do something. The drugs, the heroin, it\u2019s pouring in and it\u2019s so cheap because there\u2019s so much of it and the kids are getting stuck and other people are getting stuck.\u201d We\u2019re going to end it. We\u2019re going to end it. We\u2019re going to end it at the southern border. It\u2019s going to be over. \nAnd we\u2019re going to work really hard to get those people that are so addicted off the habit. We\u2019re going to work like hell to take care of the situation. It\u2019s a huge problem in New Hampshire. It\u2019s a huge problem all over our country. \nWe\u2019re going to have borders again and we\u2019re going to work with you people to help you solve that very big problem and we\u2019ll get it done. \n...What a group of people! And you know, on top of this group, we have thousands of people outside that can\u2019t even get in. That\u2019s what we have \u2013 thousands of people. \nHealth care \u2013 we\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare. It is a total disaster. We\u2019re repealing and replacing Obamacare. It\u2019s gone. \nWe are going to preserve our very sacred Second Amendment. There\u2019s not going to be any more chipping away at our Second Amendment. \nIf we had protection in California recently and so many other places \u2013 you could even look to Paris. Paris has the toughest gun laws in the world. France has the toughest gun laws in the world. These animals go in. They start shooting \u2013 one, two, three \u2013 130 people with many people horribly wounded, horribly wounded right now in the hospital. If there were bullets going in the other direction, believe me, it would have been a whole different story folks. But nobody had protection. \nI am going to be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. Remember that. \nDon\u2019t believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9% and 5% unemployment. The number\u2019s probably 28%, 29%, as high as 35%. In fact, I even heard recently 42%. \nDo you think we\u2019d have gathering like this if we had \u2013 if we had 5% unemployment, do you think we\u2019d have these gatherings? Forgetting about security, forgetting about ISIS, which by the way, we\u2019re going to knock the hell out of ISIS, we\u2019re going to knock the hell out of them, and it\u2019s going to be done the right way. \nSo we\u2019re going to take care of the economy, we\u2019re going to take care of jobs, we\u2019re going to take care of all of the things I said \u2013 our border \u2013 everything. Health care. It\u2019s going to be so great. \nRemember this about Obamacare. People are forgetting but now they\u2019re miserable because it\u2019s going up 45%, 35%, 55%. It\u2019s totally out of control. Probably sinks of its own volition in 2017 unless the Republicans give it another \u2013 I mean, what\u2019s going on? What\u2019s going on? \nThe budget \u2013 the last budget that was approved is an absolute disaster for everybody in this country. We owe $19 trillion as of today. We just crossed the $19 trillion mark. We\u2019re going to very shortly be at $21 trillion because of the budget. \nWe are going to make our country so strong. We are going to start winning again. \nWe don\u2019t win any more as a country. We don\u2019t win on trade. We don\u2019t win with the military. We can\u2019t beat ISIS. We don\u2019t win with anything. \nWe are going to start winning again and we\u2019re going to win so much you are going to be so happy. We are going to make America so great again. Maybe greater than ever before. \nI love you all. Thank you, New Hampshire! Thank you! Thank you, New Hampshire! Thank you! We are going now to South Carolina. We\u2019re going to win in South Carolina. I love you all. Thank you very much! \nYou know, I said it and I said it even a year ago. I said, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to do really well there.\u201d Because I\u2019m here a lot and it\u2019s so beautiful and I love it so much and I love the people. And I said, \u201cI actually think they like me a lot.\u201d And then all of a sudden, we started getting numbers in and everyone said, \u201cHow come they like Trump so much?\u201d But I have so many friends up here and they are special, special people. \nSo New Hampshire, I want to thank you. We love you. We\u2019re going to be back a lot. We\u2019re not going to forget you. You started it. Remember, you started it. \nYou know, when I came out, I heard the end of Bernie\u2019s speech and I heard some of the beginning...First of all, congratulations to Bernie. In all fairness, we have to congratulate him. We may not like it. \nBut I heard parts of Bernie\u2019s speech. He wants to give away our country, folks. He wants to give away. We\u2019re not going to let it happen. We\u2019re not going to let it happen. \nI don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going with Bernie. But we are going to make America great again but we\u2019re going to do it the old fashioned way. We\u2019re going to beat China, Japan. We\u2019re going to beat Mexico with trade. We\u2019re going to beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from us on a daily basis. It\u2019s not going to happen any more. \nWe have the greatest business people right now in the world. They call me all the time. They want to be involved. We have political hacks negotiating our deals for billions and billions of dollars. Not going to happen any more. We\u2019re going to use the finest business people in the world. We are going to do something so good and so fast and so strong and the world is going to respect us again. Believe me. \nWe\u2019re going to \u2013 do we love our country? Do we love our country? \nI think one of the things that really caught on that\u2019s very important \u2013 self-funding my campaign. Everybody on both sides \u2013 and you know I was saying two weeks ago, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think people really appreciate it.\u201d \nBecause I see all of this money being poured into commercials and it\u2019s not their money; it special interests money. And this is on both sides. This is on the Republican side, the Democratic side. Money just pouring into commercials. These are special interests. These are lobbyists. These are people that don\u2019t necessarily love our country. They don\u2019t have the best interest of our country at heart. We\u2019re not going to let it happen. We can\u2019t \u2013 we have to do something about it. \nWhen you see the kind of deals made in our country, a lot of those deals are made because the politicians aren\u2019t so stupid; they\u2019re making them for their benefit. We have to stop it. We have to stop it. We are now going to make it for your benefit. We\u2019re going to make the deals for the American people. That\u2019s the way it is. \n...So look, in a nutshell, we\u2019re going to make great trade deals. \nWe\u2019re going to rebuild our military. It\u2019s going to be so big, so strong, so powerful. Nobody is going to mess with us. Believe me. Nobody. Nobody. \nWe are going to take care of our vets...We\u2019re going to take care of our vets. Our vets are treated horribly. They\u2019re our greatest people. Our vets are going to be taken care of and you remember that. Everybody. Right? \nWe\u2019re going to have strong, incredible borders and people are going to come into our country but they\u2019re going to come into our country legally. They\u2019re going to come in legally. \nOh wow, wow, wow, wow! So beautiful. So beautiful. \nWe are going to make America great again. \nSo I want to thank everybody. But I really have to begin by paying homage to parents...[inaudible] They\u2019re up there. They\u2019re looking down. They\u2019re saying \u201cThis is something very special.\u201d They loved this country and they\u2019re very, very happy right now. So thank you to my parents. \nI want to thank my sister, Judge Barry \u2013 Maryanne. Really great sister. Another great sister, Elizabeth. My fantastic brother, Robert, who\u2019s watching right now with Ann-Marie [sp]. \nAnd I want to thank my brother, my late brother, Fred \u2013 what a fantastic \u2013 I learned so much from Fred. Taught me more than just about anybody \u2013 just about probably about even with my father \u2013 a fantastic guy. So I want to thank Fred. He\u2019s up there. He\u2019s looking down also. \nAnd we can go right down the line but we have to start with Melania. What she puts up with. Oh. She said right from the beginning, \u201cYou know if you run, you know you\u2019re going to win.\u201d And she said that from day one. So, Melania, thank you. Thank you. \nAnd Don and Vanessa, thank you so much. \nAnd Ivanka \u2013 she was out \u2013 she made seven stops today at the polling areas. So, very, very special. And Jared, Jared is a very, very successful real estate entrepreneur in Manhattan but he likes this better than real estate, I think. So Jared, thank you. \nAnd Laura and Eric, they were all out today and it was amazing. \n...You know, we learned a lot about ground games in one week, I have to tell you that. And the entire staff...the entire group, the entire staff. Incredible job... \nSo again, we have to thank the candidates because they really ran \u2013 we had some very talented people and to be victorious against some of these people even if it\u2019s for one week. But believe me, it\u2019s going to be for many weeks. Okay? \nBut they really are. They\u2019re terrific. A number of them called and I just wanted to thank them. But I wanted to congratulate the other candidates. Okay? \nNow that I got that over with. You know, it\u2019s always tough. And then tomorrow \u2013 boom, boom, boom! But that\u2019s the way it is. And really you have some real talent. We have some real talent in the Republican Party. And the RNC and Reince, we want to thank everybody. Thank you very much. \n...Well, I\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ll tell you what, what do we really want to thank. Right? We want to thank the people of New Hampshire. Right? Do we love the people of New Hampshire? "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech at the RNC", "text": "My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: \u201cI\u2019m with her.\u201d \nI choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: \u201cI\u2019m with you \u2013 the American people.\u201d \nI am your voice. \nSo to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight. \nI am with you. I will fight for you. And I will win for you. \nTo all Americans tonight in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I make this promise. \nWe will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. \nGod bless you and good night! I love you! \nMy dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he\u2019d say if he were here to see this and to see me tonight. It\u2019s because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. \nHe was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians, and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people. \nThen there\u2019s my mother, Mary. She was strong but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people that I have ever known and a great, great judge of character. She could pick them out from anywhere. \nTo my sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth, my brother, Robert, and my late brother, Fred, I will always give you my love. You are most special to me. \nI have had a truly great life in business. \nBut now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country, to go to work for you. It\u2019s time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don\u2019t win anymore, but we are going to start winning again. \nBut to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past. \nAmerica is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics. \nRemember: All of the people telling you you can\u2019t have the country you want are the same people, that would not stand \u2013 I mean they said Trump does not have a chance of being here tonight, not a chance \u2013 the same people. We love defeating those people, don\u2019t we? Love it. \nNo longer can we rely on those same people in the media and politics who, will say anything to keep our rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to believe in America. \nHistory is watching us now. We don\u2019t have much time but history is watching. It\u2019s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. \nI am asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House. And I will be a champion. \nWe are going to appoint justices of the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution. \nA replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views, principles, and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. \nMy opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment. \nI, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe. \nAt this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because, I\u2019ll tell you what, the support that they\u2019ve given me and I\u2019m not sure I totally deserve it, has been so amazing and it\u2019s had such a big reason for me being here tonight. True, so true. \nThey have much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. \nAn amendment pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago threatened religious institutions with a loss of their tax exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away. \nI am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans. \nWe can accomplish these great things and so much more. All we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. Start believing. \nIt is time to show the whole world that America is back \u2013 bigger and better and stronger than ever before. \nIn this journey, I\u2019m so lucky to have at my side, my wife, Melania, and my wonderful children. Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany and Barron. You will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. \nAnd by the way, Melania and Ivanka, did they do a job? \nOur steelworkers and are miners are going back to work again. \nWith these new economic policies, trillions and trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country. This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans. \nWe will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions of more jobs. \nWe will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice. \nMy opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children. And that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing and that\u2019s what she\u2019s done. \nWe will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. \nAnd we will fix TSA at the airports, which is a total disaster. Thank you. \nWe\u2019re going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out in their adult lives. Tremendous problem. \nWe will completely rebuild our depleted military. And the countries that we protecting at a massive cost to us will be asked to pay their fair share. \nWe will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before. \nMy just-released 10-point plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days on a line and dying. \nMy opponent dismissed the VA scandal, one more sign of how out of touch she really is. \nWe are going to ask every department head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending on projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. \nThe politicians have talked about this for years, but I\u2019m going to do it. \nShe supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. \nShe supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will not only destroy our manufacturing but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it is not going to happen. \nI pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom and our independence. We will never ever sign bad trade deals. America first again. American first. \nInstead, I will make individual deals with individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive transactions with many countries that are thousands of pages long and which no one from our country even reads or understands. \nWe are going to enforce all trade violations against any country that cheats. This includes stopping China\u2019s outrageous theft of intellectual property along with their illegal product dumping and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about \u2013 they are the greatest currently manipulators ever. \nOur horrible trade agreements with China, and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America and we\u2019ll walk away if we don\u2019t get that kind of a deal. \nOur country is going to start building and making things again. \nNext comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations, and energy rules. \nWhile Hillary Clinton plans a massive \u2013 and I mean massive \u2013 tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year, Democrat or Republican. \nMiddle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone. I mean everyone. \nAmerica is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me. It will happen and it will happen fast. \nThen we\u2019re going to deal with the issue of regulation \u2013 one of the greatest job killers of them all. \nExcessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very, very quickly. \nWe are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job-creating economic activity over the next four decades. \nMy opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and the great steelworkers of our country out of work and out of business. That will never happen with Donald J. Trump as president.\n... \nWe are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens. \nMy plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. \nAmericans want relief from uncontrolled immigration, which is what we have now. Communities want relief. \nYet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. \nHer plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from the tremendous cycle of poverty that they are going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle class. \nI have a different vision for our workers. \nIt begins with a new fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat \u2014 of which there are many. \nIt\u2019s been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office. \nI have made billions of dollars in business making deals. Now I\u2019m going to make our country rich again. \nUsing the greatest businesspeople in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements. \nAmerica has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton. \nRemember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA \u2013 one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country, or frankly, any other country. Never ever again. \nI am going to bring back our jobs to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America, and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequence. Not going to happen anymore. \nMy opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade Organization \u2013 another one of her husband\u2019s colossal mistakes and disasters. \nOf all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more \u2013 nothing even close I have to tell you \u2013 than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders, which we can solve. We have to solve it. \nThese families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protect them and certainly none to protest on their behalf. \nMy opponent will never meet with them or share in their pain. Believe me. \nInstead, my opponent wants sanctuary cities. \nBut where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Where was the sanctuary for all of the other \u2013 oh, it\u2019s so sad to even be talking about it because we can solve this problem so quickly. Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered and who have suffered so, so horribly? \nThese wounded American families have been alone. But they are not alone any longer. \nTonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate. \nWe are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. \nI have been honored to receive the endorsement of America\u2019s Border Patrol agents and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. Lawful. \nBy ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it. It won\u2019t be happening very much anymore. Believe me. \nPeace will be restored by enforcing the rules for millions who overstay their visas. Our laws will finally receive the respect that they deserve. \nTonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied and every politician who has denied them to listen very, very closely to the words I am about to say: \nOn Jan. 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. \nThis includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the state of Israel. \nRecently I have said that NATO was obsolete because it did not properly cover terror and also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost. \nShortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism \u2013 a true step in the right direction. \nLastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don\u2019t want them in our country. \nMy opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian \u2014 think of this, this is not believable, but this is what\u2019s happening \u2014 a 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of President Obama. \nShe proposes this despite the fact that there is no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. \nI only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. \nAnyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be. \nDecades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works but one that works for the American people. \nOn Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend, Jamiel Shaw. They\u2019re just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so gravely. \nWhen I am president, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally and protected equally. \nEvery action I take, I will ask myself: Does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, and Ferguson who have really in every way, folks, the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America? Any other child. \nTo make life safe for all of our citizens, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside the country. \nWe are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS, and we\u2019re going to defeat them fast. \nOnce again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women, and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning. \nThe damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over \u2013 at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many, many other locations. \nOnly weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community. \nNo good. And we\u2019re going to stop it. \nAs your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me. \nAnd I have to say as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you. \nTo protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things. \nWe must have the best, absolutely the best, gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world. The best. \nWe must abandon the failed policy of nation- building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, in Libya, in Egypt, and in Syria. \nInstead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win fast. \nMillions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly and justly for each and every American. \nIn this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy. \nWe will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought Indiana, which is amazing. \nHe is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the man for the job. \nThe first task for our new administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens our communities. \nAmerica was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. \nImmediately after Dallas, we\u2019ve seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan, and Tennessee. \nOn Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very, very badly injured. \nAn attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. \nI have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: When I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. Believe me, believe me. \nI will work with and appoint the best and brightest prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done. \nIn this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate. \nThe irresponsible rhetoric of our president, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment than, frankly, I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen. \nThis administration has failed America\u2019s inner cities. \nRemember, it has failed America\u2019s inner cities. \nIt\u2019s failed them on education. It\u2019s failed them on jobs. It\u2019s failed them in crime. It\u2019s failed them in every way and on every single level. \nI have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, of which there is so much. No sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens. \nWhen innocent people suffer because our political system lacks the will or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws \u2013 or still worse, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash \u2013 I am not able to look the other way and I won\u2019t look the other way. \nAnd when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can\u2019t see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence, I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country. \nWhen the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was \u201cextremely careless\u201d and \u201cnegligent\u201d in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible, terrible crimes. \nIn fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it, especially when others have done far less have paid so dearly. \nWhen that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, I know the time for action has come. \nI have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves. \nNobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. \nI have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders \u2013 he never had a chance. Never had a chance. \nBut his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue \u2013 trade deals that strip this country of its jobs and strip us of our wealth as a country. \nOn the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America. \nA number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation\u2019s most powerful special interests. That\u2019s because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me, it\u2019s for their benefit. \nBig business, elite media, and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings. \nThat is why Hillary Clinton\u2019s message is that things will never change. Never ever. \nMy message is that things have to change, and they have to change right now. \nEveryday, I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned. \nI have visited the laid-off factory workers and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country, and they are forgotten but they\u2019re not going to be forgotten long. These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice. \nI am your voice. \nI have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good... \nIran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control. \nAfter four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? \nISIS has spread across the region and the entire world. \nLibya is in ruins, and our ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. \nEgypt was turned over to the radical Muslim Brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. \nIraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens the West. \nAfter 15 years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before. \nThis is the legacy of Hillary Clinton \u2013 death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness. \nBut Hillary Clinton\u2019s legacy does not have to be America\u2019s legacy. \nThe problems we face now \u2013 poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad \u2013 will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place. \nA change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes. \nTonight, I will share with you my plan for action for America. \nThe most important difference between our plan and that of our opponent, is that our plan will put America first. \nAmericanism \u2013 not globalism \u2013 will be our credo. \nAs long as we are led by politicians who will not put America first, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect \u2013 the respect that we deserve. \nThe American people will come first once again. \nMy plan will begin with safety at home, which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. \nThere can be no prosperity without law and order. \nWhat about our economy? Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper. \nNearly four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are now not employed. \nTwo million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. \nAnother 14 million people have left the workforce entirely. \nHousehold incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000 \u2013 that\u2019s 16 years ago. \nOur trade deficit in goods reached nearly \u2013 think of this, think of this \u2013 our trade deficit is $800 billion. Think of that, $800 billion last year alone. \nWe\u2019re going to fix that. \nThe budget is no better. President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion and growing. \nAnd yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart. Our airports are Third World condition. And 43 million Americans are on food stamps. \nNow, let us consider the state of affairs abroad. \nNot only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they\u2019ve lived through one international humiliation after another \u2013 one after another. \nWe all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint. This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing. It will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. \nAnother humiliation came when President Obama drew a red line in Syria, and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing. \nIn Libya, our consulate \u2013 the symbol of American prestige around the globe \u2013 was brought down in flames. \nAmerica is far less safe \u2013 and the world is far less stable \u2013 than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America\u2019s foreign policy. \nLet\u2019s defeat her in November, okay? \nI am certain that it was a decision that President Obama truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgment \u2013 something pointed out by Bernie Sanders \u2013 are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. \nLet\u2019s review the record. \nIn 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a really big, big reduction in violence. \nI will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore. \nSo if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully crafted lies, and the media myths, the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there. \nBut here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth and nothing else. \nThese are the facts: \nDecades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this administration\u2019s rollback of criminal enforcement. \nHomicides last year increased by 17% in America\u2019s 50 largest cities. That\u2019s the largest increase in 25 years. \nIn our nation\u2019s capital, killings have risen by 50%. They\u2019re up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore. \nIn the president\u2019s hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victim of shootings this year alone, and almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office. \nThe number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year. \nNearly 180,000 illegal immigrants, with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens. \nThe number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. \nThey are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources. \nOne such border crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21-years-old and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 grade point average \u2013 number one in her class. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law. \nI\u2019ve met Sarah\u2019s beautiful family. But to this administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn\u2019t worth protecting. No more. One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders. \n...Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. \nFriends, delegates, and fellow Americans, I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States. \nUSA, USA, USA, USA! \nWho would have believed that when we started on June 16 last year, we \u2013 and I say we because we are a team \u2013 what have we seen? Almost 14 million votes \u2013 the most in the history of the Republican Party \u2013 and that the Republican Party would get 60% more votes than it received eight years ago. \nWho would have believed this? Who would have believed this? \nThe Democrats on the other hand received 20% fewer votes than they got four years ago. Not so good, not so good. \nTogether we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. \nWe will be a country of generosity and warmth, but we will also be a country of law and order. \nOur convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation \u2013 the attacks on our police and the terrorism of our cities threaten our very way of life. Any politician that does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country. \nAmericans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of the violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally; some have even been its victims. \nI have a message for all of you: The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon \u2013 and I mean very soon \u2013 come to an end. \nBeginning on Jan. 20th of 2017, safety will be restored. \nThe most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead. \nIt is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Greensboro, North Carolina", "text": "And we have the cards. We have the cards. We have all the cards. \nBecause we\u2019re like the piggy bank that everybody keeps stealing from. But pretty soon, we\u2019re not going to be the piggy bank anymore. We\u2019re going to be the opposite of the piggy bank. \nWe\u2019re going to have \u2013 we owe $20 trillion. Half of which came during the Obama years and yet we didn\u2019t fix anything. Our roads are bad. Our bridges are bad. Our tunnels are bad. Our schools are bad. Our hospitals are bad. \nWe\u2019re going to start making things again in America. \nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we\u2019re going to lower our business tax from 35% to 15%. The biggest since Ronald Reagan. \nWages will rise. Jobs will return, and factories will come rushing \u2013 rushing \u2013 back in to our country. \nWe\u2019re also going to fix our inner cities. 45% of African-American children are under the age of 6 are living in poverty. Think of it. 45%. \n58% of African-American youths don\u2019t have jobs. \nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. 3,000 people since January. 3,000. It\u2019s like a war zone. \nViolent crime in Greensboro increased by 25% last year. Did you know that? 25%. \nTo those African-Americans suffering in our country, I say what do you have to lose? Vote for Trump. I\u2019m going to fix it. What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? \nI will fight harder for you than anyone has fought for you before. \nHere is some of the more amazing things we\u2019re going to do when we takeover hopefully this incredible country and run it properly in 2017. \nWe\u2019re going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan. \nWe\u2019re going to eliminate job killing regulations, which are a disaster. \nWe are going to defend religious liberty. \nWe\u2019re going to end Common Core. We\u2019re going to bring our education local. \nWe\u2019re going to support the men and women of law enforcement. \nRepeal and replace Obamacare. \nWe are going to save our Second Amendment. \nWe are going to appoint great justices to the United States Supreme Court, who uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \nSo you have 25 days to make every dream you\u2019ve ever dreamed of for your country come true. \nBut to beat the system, you have to pound the pavement, get your friends and coworkers out, organize your neighbors and fight for the country you want. \nOn Nov. 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voters. It\u2019s time. \nI\u2019m asking all Americans \u2013 Republicans, Independents, and Democrats \u2013 to join us in our campaign to defeat the corrupt establishment and give our government back to the people. It\u2019s going to happen. \nI\u2019m going to fight for every citizen of every background. Thank you. \nSo we\u2019re going to fight. And we\u2019re going to fight for every stretch of this nation. And I\u2019m going to fight to bring us all together. \nWe\u2019re a divided nation \u2013 very divided nation right now. We\u2019re going to be an unified nation \u2013 a nation of love. \nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag. \nYou\u2019re going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. And we\u2019re having a good time. We\u2019re having a good time. You\u2019re going to remember this day. This is a movement like nobody\u2019s ever seen in this country before \u2013 even our enemies admit that. \nWe\u2019re going to make history together. You\u2019re going to look back at the election on Nov. 8th and you\u2019re going to say it\u2019s the most important vote you\u2019ve ever cast because that\u2019s when our country started working again, that\u2019s when our country became safe again, that\u2019s when our country became strong again and rich again. \nAnd we will make America \u2013 just like your beautiful hat \u2013 we will make America great again. \nThank you. Thank you very much. \nWhen it comes to keeping America safe, I believe in a three \u2013 and I think you believe in these words. I think. Three very important words. Peace through strength. Right? \nAnd we don\u2019t want to use our strength but you have to have our strength and the world is laughing at us. They\u2019re laughing at the stupidity of our president. \nRemember he drew the land in the sand? The line is in the sand. \nRemember Hillary at the last debate? \u201cI wasn\u2019t Secretary of State then.\u201d She doesn\u2019t even know. It turned out she lied. \nRemember she said TPP was gold standard? She said she never said that. During the debate, she lied about that. She\u2019s a liar. \nBut to be a strong country, we must also be a very rich country. At the center of our economic revival, we\u2019ll be fixing our really horrendous one-way street, horrible trade deals. We\u2019re going to fix them, folks. \nYou know, last year, we lost almost $800 billion in trade deficits. We had trade deficits with other nations of almost $800 billion. \nAnd I have some friends in the audience. I guarantee you. I can take anyone of those friends \u2013 one in particular who happens to be brutal \u2013 but that\u2019s okay. Lives in North Carolina, so you know, one of those things. Right? But a great businessperson. \nI\u2019ll put him in charge...we will have such a good thing. And there are people like that. We have the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest business people in the world. We don\u2019t use them. We use political hacks. \nSo we have a trade deficit of almost $800 billion. Sad, isn\u2019t it? Isn\u2019t it pathetic? \nNorth Carolina\u2019s industries and workers have been crushed by Bill Clinton\u2019s signing of NAFTA supported by crooked Hillary. \nDon\u2019t forget, a lot of people want that to happen because they make a lot of money by taking money out of this country. Those deals are very good for a lot of people. \nEverybody knows NAFTA is no good for the United States but it\u2019s good for their wallets in some cases. \nYou\u2019ve lost nearly half of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. Did you know that? You\u2019ve lost almost half of your manufacturing jobs. \nThis region used to be the furniture manufacturing hub of the world. I know because I bought plenty. \nBut the NAFTA deal and then China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary backed disaster \u2013 have sent those jobs to other countries. You know better than anybody. \nI used to be here a lot for furniture. Gets smaller and smaller every year, doesn\u2019t it? You\u2019re not going to have anything left pretty soon. \nWe\u2019re living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Our jobs have been stolen from us and we have people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, in particular our leadership. \nIf I win, on day one, we are going to announce our plan to re-negotiate NAFTA. \nIf we don\u2019t get the deal we want, we\u2019ll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better, a much more fairer deal because right now, we\u2019re a one-way highway into Mexico \u2013 a one-way highway. \nI mean, you take a look at this. It\u2019s one-way. They get the jobs. They get the factories. They get the cash. \nAnd all we get? We get illegal immigration and we get drugs, and the drugs are poisoning our youths. The drugs are poisoning our youths and others. \nBut we\u2019re getting the drugs and we\u2019re getting lots of problems. \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you I was endorsed by, as you know, by ICE and by the Border Patrol agents \u2013 16,500 border patrol. They\u2019ve never done this before. They\u2019ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. Both groups endorsed me because we\u2019re going to have strong borders. \nAnd we\u2019re going to have people come into our country but they\u2019re going to come in legally. Legally. \nAnd we\u2019re going to stand up to China. We\u2019re going to stop their currency manipulation, and product dumping, which is killing us. \nAnd they don\u2019t follow the rules, and if they don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to institute tariffs when they send something into our country and believe me they are going to obey our rules so quickly you have no idea. \nAnd we\u2019ll end up with a better relationship with China than we do now. \nLook what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re building a massive fortress against everything. A massive fortress in the South China Sea. And yet, they\u2019re ripping us off. \nNow, if they\u2019re ripping us off, you wouldn\u2019t think they\u2019d be building fortresses. They have no respect for our president, which I can understand that. They have no respect for Obama. They have no respect for our country and they\u2019re getting away with murder. \nHillary Clinton said, \u201cMy dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.\u201d There goes the rest of your jobs, by the way. \nThere it goes. But even though she doesn\u2019t say that but that\u2019s what she said in a very, very secret meeting. \nThe emails show that behind closed doors speaking to these international bankers, Hillary Clinton\u2019s pledged to destroy the sovereignty of the United States. \nA Trump administration will secure and defend our borders better than you\u2019ve ever seen them before. \nAnd yes, we will build a wall. It will happen. \nCrooked Hillary also wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees to pour into our country. And that\u2019s over Obama numbers and those are thousands and thousands of people. \nEven though she admitted it in private, according to Wikileaks, again, nobody\u2019s covering Wikileaks. They\u2019re covering somebody that I never saw before... \n...That she knows that terrorists are trying to infiltrate the refugee program. \nSo you have terrorists coming in. She knows they\u2019re coming in, and yet she wants to increase it. \nHillary\u2019s support for open borders in the Middle East will put us in the same position as France with multi-generational terrorism embedded in our community and our country will never be the same. \nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. \nAt the same time, we\u2019re going to take care of our military and we\u2019re going to take care of our great, great, great veterans. They\u2019ve been treated very badly. \nThat includes veterans\u2019 choice so veterans can either attend a public VA facility or if they have to wait on line like they\u2019ve been doing sometimes for as much as seven days and then still not get proper care, they\u2019ll go to a private medical center or they\u2019ll go to a private or public or something. They will go outside. They\u2019ll go to a private doctor. They\u2019ll go to a private hospital. They\u2019ll go to a public hospital. \nWe\u2019re going to get them care and we\u2019re going to pay for that care. \nThey\u2019re not going to wait in line for seven days and die sometimes waiting in line for a simple, simple procedure or prescription. It\u2019s not going to happen like that any longer for our veterans. Okay? Not going to happen. \nAnd Hillary Clinton said no, no, the VA is doing a good job. Okay? \nNorth Carolina is home to more than 100,000 active duty military personnel and almost 800,000 veterans. The military supports over 500,000 jobs in this state. \nWe are going to repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and we are going to rebuild the military of the United States, which is very sadly depleted. \nBut the whole thing we\u2019re going through \u2013 Bernie Sanders, it was a rigged deal. The whole thing is one big fix. It\u2019s one big fix. It\u2019s one big, ugly lie. It\u2019s one big fix. \nThe press can\u2019t write the kind of things they write, which are lies, lies, lies. The stories are fabrications and false. \nAnd the only thing I say is hopefully, hopefully, our patriotic movement will overcome this terrible deception. \nHopefully, our great movement and there\u2019s never been anything like this in the United States and the only way they figured they can slow it down is to come up with people that are willing to say, \u201cOh, I was with Donald Trump in 1980. I was sitting with him on an airplane and he went after me on the plane.\u201d \nYeah, I\u2019m going to go after. Believe me, she would not be my first choice. That I can tell you. You don\u2019t know. That would not be my first choice. \nHopefully, our great movement powered by everyday citizens will overcome the sickness that is plaguing our politics and our media. \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what, our media is indeed sick and it\u2019s making our country sick. And we\u2019re going to stop it. We\u2019re going to stop it, folks. \nAll right, let\u2019s get on now. Let\u2019s get on to another subject. But isn\u2019t it good that we talk about this? Right? \nWho thinks I shouldn\u2019t talk? We\u2019ll talk jobs. Who thinks I shouldn\u2019t talk about it? Does anybody think that? Okay, I agree. \nWhen somebody, you know, a long time ago, when you get hit, you hit back. You\u2019ve got to do it. You don\u2019t just say \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t get hit. I didn\u2019t get hit.\u201d \nWhen you get hit, we are destroying our country with these sick people back there and they know it better than anybody in this arena. \nI ran because I knew what trouble our country was in. Our country is in tremendous trouble. You know this. \nYou know this in North Carolina because you see what\u2019s happening to your jobs. They\u2019re disappearing. \nI know it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about you and that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this. I didn\u2019t need to do this. \nBut it\u2019s about you. It\u2019s about bringing our country back, making our country great again. \nI\u2019m taking these slings and arrows for you so we can have our borders, so we can get back our jobs, so we can be a safe nation again. \nYou know, the murder \u2013 the number of murders in our country this year went up more than they have in 45 years. \nIt\u2019s true. Look, Obama is an incompetent. He\u2019s an incompetent president. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s out campaigning all day long. He\u2019s talking about me like he knows me. I don\u2019t know him. He doesn\u2019t know me. \nAnd why doesn\u2019t some woman maybe come up and say what they say falsely about me they could say about him? They could say it about anybody. They could say it about anybody. \nI\u2019ll tell you what, he\u2019d better be careful because they could say it about anybody. Anybody at all. \nBut Obama is an incompetent as a president. He\u2019s about as bad as it gets. \nLook at what\u2019s happening. How Iran is taunting us. Look at what\u2019s going on. Look at the world. He gives Iran $400 million in cash but it turns out to be $1.7 billion in cash. Gives them $150 billion. \nThis guy doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing and it\u2019s an embarrassment. \nYou look at the Middle East and it\u2019s a blow-up. It\u2019s a total disaster. \nWe have an incompetent president. I hate to say it. But it\u2019s 100% true. \nAnd all he\u2019s doing instead of working on your jobs and your companies leaving for Mexico and other places, he\u2019s campaigning for crooked Hillary. That\u2019s all he does. \nEither we win this election or we\u2019re going to lose our country because four more years of Obama, you can\u2019t take it. \nWikileaks documents, Hillary Clinton speaking in secret \u2013 really and you saw this too \u2013 a secret Brazilian bank. \nAnd let me tell you, if it did happen, if it did happen, 100% she would have written it. It would have been the biggest story of the year. Okay? \nThese are all horrible lies. All fabrications. And we can\u2019t let them change the most important election in our lifetimes. \nIf 5% of the people think it\u2019s true and maybe 10% think, we don\u2019t win. \nIn other words, they make up lies. They have people come around \u2013 \u201cOh, Donald Trump did this or that.\u201d I never saw these people before. I don\u2019t know who they are. \nAnd then you watch these phony networks and dishonest networks who are 100%. \nLet me tell you something about Hillary Clinton. She\u2019s got nothing going. She\u2019s got nothing. \nThe only thing she\u2019s got going is the media. She\u2019s got nothing going. She\u2019s got nothing. \nThe other day at the debate where by the way I absolutely destroyed her, okay? Every online poll, even Time Magazine, Time Magazine\u2019s not exactly in love with me but every online poll has us killing her. \nShe said, the other day I\u2019m standing and I told you this. But I\u2019m standing at my podium and she walks in front of me. Right? She walks in front of me. You know? \nAnd when she walked in front of me, believe me, I wasn\u2019t impressed. \nBut she walks in front and she takes a question and then she walked back and that was the end of that. No problem. \nThen she said the next day I invaded her space. Give me a break. \nAnd I was waiting for that because she had that incident once before where they made up something \u2013 some guy invaded her space. The poor guy lost the election because of it. \nBut I was very conscious of this so I purposely \u2013 I purposely didn\u2019t do anything. \nSo \u2013 get this guy out of here. Get him out. Get out of here... \nFolks, folks, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to our country. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening. That is total disrespect for our flag. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening to our country. We\u2019re going to turn it around, folks. We\u2019re going to turn it around. \nSo, just to finish up, so just to finish up, you see what\u2019s happening. The process is rigged. This whole election is being rigged. \nThese lies spread by the media without witnesses, without back-up or anything else, are poisoning the minds of the electorate. \nNo witnesses. No back-up. No anything else. \nAnd I\u2019m telling you, I have many top professionals. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about this, Donald. Nobody believes it.\u201d I said, \u201cMaybe some do believe it. You have to talk about it.\u201d \nAm I right? When somebody makes an accusation that you did something and you never saw this person before, it\u2019s a lie, it\u2019s a total lie. It\u2019s fabrication. \nSometimes they do it for fame. Maybe they get money. Who knows? The Clinton campaign is pushing it. \nThe New York Times did a story on somebody where it was totally false. They knew it was totally false. We gave them the information. They wrote a whole big page about somebody where they were sending them emails and letters and everything. And then you realize, it was a one-way send, by the way. There was nothing sent back. \nAnd you realize it was a totally phony deal. They did a whole big story on it. \nThey didn\u2019t mention all of the emails. They didn\u2019t mention everything coming my way. \nAnd others looked at it and as bad as they were, as soon as they saw all this stuff that was sent, they immediately, immediately, decided not to do this. The New York Times did a story on it. \nThey read these stories and people might not know how untrue they are. It\u2019s really a disgrace. \nI\u2019ve been saying this for a long time. The whole thing we\u2019ve been going through \u2013 and I hate to say it. \nAs you have seen, right now I am being viciously attacked with lies and smears. It\u2019s a phony deal. \nI have no idea who these women are. Have no idea. I have no idea. \nAnd I think you all know I have no idea because you understand me for a lot of years. Okay? \nWhen you looked at that horrible woman last night, you said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d \nWhoever she is, wherever she comes from, the stories are total fiction. They\u2019re 100% made up. They never happened. They never would happen. \nI don\u2019t think they\u2019d happen with many people but they certainly aren\u2019t going to happen with me. \nFolks, you know, my people always say, \u201cOh, don\u2019t talk about it. Talk about jobs. Talk about the economy.\u201d \nDon\u2019t worry. Your jobs, they are going to be coming back to North Carolina like you\u2019ve never seen. The economy is going to be good. \nBut I feel like I have to talk about it because you have to dispute when somebody says something. \nAnd fortunately, we have the microphone. We can dispute. Some people can\u2019t. \nThese are lies being pushed by the media and the Clinton campaign to try and keep their grip on our country. \nThey\u2019re all false. They\u2019re totally invented. Fiction. All 100% totally and completely fabricated. Never met this person, these people. I don\u2019t know who they are. I don\u2019t know who they are. \nThink of what\u2019s happening to our country. Think of what\u2019s happening. I don\u2019t know who these people are. \nI look on television. I think it\u2019s a disgusting thing and it\u2019s being pushed. They have no witnesses. There\u2019s nobody around. They just come out. Some are doing it for probably a little fame. They get some free fame. It\u2019s a total set-up. \nNow suddenly after many, many years phony accusers come out less than a month before one of the most important elections in the history of our country. \nIt also comes at a time as Wikileaks unveils horrible, horrible things about Hillary Clinton. But they\u2019d rather talk about this. \nSomebody you\u2019ve never seen said, \u201cOh, in 1992, he went like this.\u201d \nOne came out recently where I was sitting alone in some club. I really don\u2019t sit alone that much. Honestly, folks, I don\u2019t think I sit alone. I go in with groups of people. I was sitting alone by myself like this. And then I went whoa! To somebody. \nI just heard this one. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s like unbelievable. \nEven a simple investigation would have shown these allegations against me in just about cases it\u2019s nonsense. It\u2019s false. \nAn eyewitness has already debunked the People Magazine story. \nHere\u2019s my question about the dishonest writer from People Magazine. Why didn\u2019t she write what she said happened before she wrote this story? Why didn\u2019t she put it in the story? The story would have been one of the big stories. I was the big story of the Apprentice. Why didn\u2019t she do it 12 years ago? 12 years ago? \nShe\u2019s writing the story \u2013 no, think of this. Think of this. She\u2019s right. She\u2019s a liar. She is a liar. She\u2019s writing a story. Check out her Facebook page. You\u2019ll understand. Hey, she\u2019s writing a story about a beautiful love story \u2013 Melania and Donald \u2013 and she said I made inappropriate move. \nNow, just so you understand. That\u2019s a big story. If I did. \nShe wrote the most beautiful story. Honestly, the most beautiful story. 100% story. Like beautiful. \nWhy wouldn\u2019t she have put this into the story? \nNow, two nights ago, I get a call, People Magazine is \u2013 it\u2019s okay. No, it\u2019s not okay. It\u2019s about a story that was written 12 years ago. \nShe was on last night or one of the top people at People was on and he said, \u201cNo, we were just informed of it.\u201d \nWell, did you hear about it 12 years ago? Did you hear about it five years ago? \n\u201cNo, no, we never \u2013 we just heard about it recently.\u201d \nThese people are sick. These people are sick. \nAnd the reason she didn\u2019t write it 12 years ago is very simple. It never happened. Never happened. It\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s a lie. \nHillary Clinton told the FBI 39 times she couldn\u2019t remember. She couldn\u2019t remember anything. \u201cI couldn\u2019t remember. I couldn\u2019t remember.\u201d \nOr recall key events concerning her illegal email server and related misconduct. \nNow, in new written testimony just out as part of the Freedom of Information Act request, Hillary Clinton has just said she couldn\u2019t remember, recall or anything key events or key things 21 different times. \nIt\u2019s one more reason that if I win, I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor and we also have to investigate the investigation itself. \nHillary bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena. She got a subpoena from Congress and she said, \u201cThis is no good. This is terrible because those 33,000 emails had bad stuff.\u201d And she said, \u201cGet rid of them. Delete them. Bleach them.\u201d \nNobody bleaches because it\u2019s such an expensive process. She bleached. Get rid of them. \nAnd then she made everybody get rid of iPhones, her  iPhones, and some were hammered. They were hammered to death. \nAll to cover up her crimes. \nYesterday, new disclosures were made showing again how Hillary Clinton\u2019s pay for play works. \nSaudi Arabia paid Bill Clinton a lot of money to make a speech and then got an arms deal from Hillary and her State Department that they were unable to get. \nThe nation of Qatar was also kicked in $1 million for Bill Clinton\u2019s birthday party. So nice. \nThat as Wikileaks showed the Clintons ripped off the people of Haiti, that they were suffering and dying after the earthquake and her brothers on the board of a gold mine. Her brother. \nBut the media\u2019s covering up for the Clintons and their many crimes against so many people. \nThe Wikileaks document show how the media conspires and collaborates with the Clinton campaign, including giving the questions and answers to Hillary Clinton before the debate. Okay? \nWhat a rigged system, folks. \nLast night, we had a massive crowd of over 20,000 people in Cincinnati. Filled up an arena. And the media won\u2019t even talk about the size of the crowd, the enthusiasm of the crowd. \nI watched NBC this morning, they said, \u201cLast night, Donald Trump was in Cincinnati.\u201d \nIf Hillary Clinton has 800 people, \u201cOh, the crowd is so big.\u201d \nIt is horrible. It is really horrible. \nThe corrupt media is trying to do everything in their power to stop our movement. Believe me. They don\u2019t want this happening. We have one of the great movements. We have a great movement. \nWe have a movement that\u2019s never happened before. \nAnd no paper\u2019s more corrupt than the failing New York Times. The good news is it is failing. It won\u2019t be around too much longer. But they are really, really bad people. \nThe largest shareholder in the Times is Carlos Slim. Now, Carlos Slim, as you know, comes from Mexico. He\u2019s given many millions of dollars to the Clintons and their initiatives. So Carlos Slim, largest donor of the paper, from Mexico. \nReporters at the New York Times, they\u2019re not journalists. They\u2019re corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and for Hillary Clinton. \nWe\u2019re going to let foreign corporations and their CEOs decide the outcomes of the \u2013 you just can\u2019t do this. We can\u2019t let this happen. We are not going to let it happen where they decide the outcome of our elections. They can\u2019t do it and we\u2019re not going to let it happen. \nThis is our last chance to save our country and reclaim it for we the people and it\u2019s going to happen. \nOh, it\u2019s going to happen. \nThank you. Wow. Thank you, everybody. Nice place. Plenty of room. \nIn 25 days, we\u2019re going win the state of North Carolina, which I love, and we\u2019re going to win the White House. \nEarly voting starts on Oct. 20th so you have to get out there but Nov. 8th. That\u2019s our day. Nov. 8th. Right? Nov. 8th. But do the early voting. \nI\u2019d also like to take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to everyone recovering in the tragic aftermath of Hurricane Matthew. You know about it very well, unfortunately, right here. \nWe send our deepest condolences to those who have lost loved ones. We are with you and we will always be with you and help you when needed. \nSo good luck to everybody. \nThe incredible spirit of the people in this state will power its recovery and it\u2019s the same spirit that will rebuild our nation. \nI have property in this state. This is a great state. You know my property. Beautiful property. Great employees. \nIn a Trump administration, we will end decades of policies that enrich special interests and foreign countries at our expense. \nWe\u2019re going to take on the big media, big business, and big donors that are bleeding our country dry. We\u2019re losing our jobs. \nWe\u2019re going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, take care of our vets \u2013 our great vets \u2013 and we\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare. 100%. That is a disaster. \nPremiums are soaring double digits in North Carolina beyond anybody\u2019s wildest expectations. It\u2019s a disaster. \nAnd you know what\u2019s going on. Your country will be left with only one insurer. You\u2019re going to have nothing. Everyone\u2019s leaving. And you\u2019re going to have one insurer. You\u2019re going to have nobody. \nObamacare is failing. We\u2019re going to repeal it and we\u2019re going to replace it. \nYour jobs come back under a Trump administration. Your income goes up under a Trump administration. Your taxes go way down under a Trump administration. \nYour companies won\u2019t be leaving our country under a Trump administration. They\u2019ll be staying right here. \nAnd believe me, there are plenty of them right now negotiating to leave. I hate to tell you that. \nThese are the issues that we\u2019ll discuss at the next debate, which I look very much forward to. \nCrooked Hillary is doing no more public events until after the debate. They say she\u2019s doing debate prep but really she\u2019s just resting. She\u2019s resting. \nFor what she\u2019s done, they should lock her up. She\u2019s disgraceful. It\u2019s disgraceful. Honestly, it\u2019s disgraceful what\u2019s going on in our country is a disgrace. \nThe Hillary Clinton documents released by Wikileaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake on Nov. 8th. \nWikileaks released new Clinton campaign emails revealing how friendly Hillary was with the Attorney General Loretta Lynch. \nThis was only months prior to Lynch\u2019s investigation of Hillary\u2019s illegal secret email server that gave foreign governments access to our confidential information. \nThis comes on the heels of disclosure that Clinton campaign was conspiring and colluding with the State Department and Justice Department over the release of her emails and the investigation into her server. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s economic speech", "text": "Save over $1 trillion. Again, this is spending that does not touch defense, because we have to build up our military, which is so terribly depleted. And that does not touch entitlements. \nIf our plan exceeds to 3.5%, 10-year growth average, then our jobs proposed will actually reduce and start really, strongly reducing the deficit. \nSavings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs. \nThis is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country. \nThis is what our new future will look like. \nI\u2019m going to lower your taxes very, very substantially. I\u2019m going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulation. All of these regulations on your business and in your life. I\u2019m going to unleash American energy. I\u2019m going to repeal and replace Obamacare. I\u2019m going to appoint justices of the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution. \nI\u2019m going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets, who are treated so badly. \nIn many cases, our vets are treated not nearly as well as people who come into our country illegally. We can\u2019t have it. \nI\u2019m going to save your Second Amendment, which is under siege. \nI\u2019m going to stop illegal immigration and drugs from pouring into our country and totally poisoning our youth and others. A tremendous problem. \nAnd, yes, we will build the wall. The wall will be built. \nAnd, just in case you\u2019re worried who is going to pay for it, Mexico will pay for it. I\u2019m being totally serious about that. Mexico will pay for it. \nAnd you understand, Mexico, by the way we look at the trade deficit we have with Mexico, it\u2019s massive. The wall is peanuts compared to what we\u2019re talking about. Mexico will pay for the wall. \nAnd, I\u2019m going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA, and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first and put the American worker back to work. That includes our miners and our steelworkers, they\u2019re going back to work. \nWe will rebuild our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our highways, our airports, schools, hospitals. We\u2019ll rebuild everything. \nAmerican cars will travel the roads. American planes will soar the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. American hands will rebuild this nation. And American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. \nWe will put new American metal and new American steel into the spine of this country. Jobs will return. Incomes will rise. New factories will come rushing back to our shores. \nWe will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. And we will make America great again. \nThank you very much. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you very much. \nAnd, honestly we\u2019re going to be calling on you because we have people negotiating the biggest deals in the world, far bigger than your company deals. Your company deals are like little deals by comparison. It\u2019s true. \nYou take some of these big companies and you look at some of these trade deals, hate to say it, but your companies are peanuts. \nBut we\u2019re going to use our best. \nRight now, we have political hacks, negotiating the biggest, most important deals in the world. \nWe\u2019re going to start with NAFTA which is causing so much damage to our country. \nWe will entirely re-negotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be a good one for us as a country and for our workers or we will terminate it until a brand new and productive deal can be signed. \nWe\u2019ll also, and we have to, we\u2019re going to keep America out of Trans-Pacific Partnership unless we can do something that\u2019s phenomenal and I\u2019m not seeing it right now, I can tell you that. I\u2019m not seeing it. \nNext, I\u2019m going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China. \nAnd I like China. They\u2019re my tenant. They buy condos all the time. They\u2019re just fine. But you know what? They are a currency manipulator. and we\u2019re going to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States. They are a manipulator, Grand Master level. We can\u2019t allow it to happen and our people and our representatives and our politicians don\u2019t have even a little clue as to how to play the game. \nWe have a trade deficit this year with China of approximately $500 billion. What kind of a deal is that? And this has been going on for years \u2013 $200 billion, $300 billion, $400 billion for years. \nI\u2019m going to instruct the United States Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China. \nChina\u2019s unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance into the WTO, and I intend to enforce the rules. \nAnd I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll make a deal somewhere along the way but they\u2019re not playing fairly and our politicians don\u2019t understand how to play the game. \nIf China does not stop its illegal activities including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual properties, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists. You know what that means. \nJust a single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone, just alone, would add millions of new American jobs. \nAccording to the United States International Trade Commission, improved protection of America\u2019s \u2013 just think of this, improved protection of America\u2019s intellectual property in China would add two million jobs a year within the United States every single year and we do nothing. We allow them to get away with it. \nWho can blame them and I don\u2019t blame them at all. If you can get away with it, they\u2019re going to get away with it. \nWe\u2019re going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country and open a new highway of jobs back into our country. \nHere\u2019s how the plan adds up. \nWe\u2019re proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as a $2.6 trillion under dynamic growth models, which is how taxes should be scored. \nThis includes the child care plan that we announced the other day. \nOur economic team has further modeled that the growth induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining debt. \nThat leaves around $800 billion. This money can all be saved through simple common sense reforms. \nIf we just save one penny of each federal dollars spent on non-defense and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade. One penny. We can all do that. \nHillary Clinton wants to go even further and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion. \nA Trump administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production. \nAccording to the Institute for American Energy Resources, this will increase the GDP by more than $100 billion annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, increase annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next seven years, increase federal, state and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over four decades, increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over a 40-year period. \nIn addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects which are desperately needed, including the billions of dollars and projects held up by President Obama. Currently be held up. They just won\u2019t approve it anything. Creating countless more jobs in the process. \nFinally comes trade \u2013 the foundation for everything. \nAmerica\u2019s annual trade deficit with the world is now almost $800 billion dollars a year. \nWho\u2019s negotiating these deals? Anybody in this room negotiating these wonderful deals? \nThink of it, we have a trade deficit of almost $800 billion a year. \nThat\u2019s going to change so fast. \nBetween World War I and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate. \nBut, after China join the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2%. \nPredatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation, which is a big one, and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions of dollars and wealth right out of our country. Right out of our country. \nSo sad that we allow this to happen. Our incompetent politicians were not watching. And, the ones that were watching were taken care of in some form because this should have never been allowed to have happened. \nIt is no great secret that many of the special interest funding my opponent\u2019s campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals. They are terrible. They\u2019re terrible for everybody. \nThe same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, another disaster, and now, the Transpacific Partnership that they\u2019re pushing so strongly. \nThe verdict is in. All of the special interests that the media raced, and they just raced to comment and raced to get comment from, have been proven wrong over such a long period of time. \nEvery, single deal they\u2019ve promoted, every lie, and every prediction has crashed. They just crashed. They\u2019ve been so absolutely wrong and they\u2019ve been so bad for our country. \nOur manufacturing base has crumbled. Communities have been hollowed out. Wages have declined and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000. \nI\u2019ve proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America. \nWe need our wealth back. We don\u2019t have wealth. We are a debtor nation. \nThis includes the following steps. \nI\u2019m going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements that a foreign country is using to harm our country and our workers. \nThat\u2019s what\u2019s happening. They\u2019re being harmed. And our country is being harmed. \nI will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators. And, I will tell you, some of them are in this room right now. Not all of them, but some. \nAnd, I know who you are. \nA reduction of more than 40%. \nI know that\u2019s what you people have been waiting for. \nAn explosion of new businesses and new jobs will be created. \nIt will be amazing to watch. You watch and it\u2019ll happen. \nWe will also allow United States-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment. Big, big deal. \nOn top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth, and this is wealth that\u2019s parked overseas. \nNobody knows how much it is. They say it\u2019s $2.5 trillion \u2013 I have people that think it\u2019s $5 trillion. \nWe\u2019ll bring them back and it\u2019ll be taxed only at the rate of 10% instead of 35%. And who would bring it back at thirty-five percent? Obviously nobody because nobody\u2019s doing it. \nI think it\u2019s going to be something that will be so phenomenal \u2013 far beyond what people even think. \nBy taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come roaring back into our country and lots of good things will start to happen. \nWe will turn America into a new magnet for new jobs, and that means jobs in our poorest communities. So important. \nAnd right now, we have companies leaving the country because taxes are too high, but we actually have companies leaving the country to get their money, and that\u2019s a first. Nobody\u2019s ever heard of that one before, but believe me, that\u2019s happened. \nNext comes regulations. One of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by out of control bureaucrats. \nRegulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry, and the regulations industry is one business I will absolutely put to an end day one. \nIn 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations \u2013 up from 2,400 the prior year. \nEvery year, over-regulation costs our economy $2 trillion a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000. \nI propose a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety. \nAnd I will eliminate all needless and job killing regulations now on the books and there are plenty of them. \nThis includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations like the Waters of the U.S. Rule. It also means scrapping the EPA\u2019s so-called Clean Power Plan, which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year. This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plants. I mean, all over the country they\u2019re shutting down. \nRemember what Hillary Clinton said. She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills and shut down the steel workers, and we\u2019re not going to let it happen. \nWe\u2019re going to put our great miners and our steel workers back to work. \nEnergy reform is central to our plan as well. \nAccording to Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama\u2019s energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion and reduce incomes by $7,000 per person. \nAnd today you have workers, and I see them all the time and I meet them all the time, and they\u2019re part of this massive group of people that have just come onto this movement. But you have workers making less money today than they made 18 years ago in real wages. \nThey\u2019re working much harder, oftentimes because of the disastrous Obamacare that we\u2019re going to repeal and replace. Oftentimes, they\u2019re working two jobs. So, they\u2019re working harder, they\u2019re older, and they\u2019re making less. \nLike me, I\u2019m working harder than I\u2019ve ever worked also. But, these are minor \u2013 nobody cares about that, that\u2019s okay. Who cares about that?! \nIt took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate its first $10 trillion in debt. It took President Obama less than eight years to add another $10 trillion. \nNow it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, our infrastructure but that didn\u2019t happen. \nInstead, the opposite happened. \nWe doubled our debt and in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military. \nGreatest people on Earth and they have a badly depleted military. Its equipment \u2013 old and tired. \nAnd another 14 million people who have left the workforce. \nNever has so much money been spent so poorly and so unwisely. \nBut we\u2019re going to turn that all around and here\u2019s how. \nIt begins with bold, new tax reform. \nDon\u2019t worry, they\u2019re going down, not up, they\u2019re going down. Think you were concerned they\u2019re going up. \nAs outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets, from seven to three. \nThe new brackets will be 12%, 25% and 33% but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all. \nIn fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax world entirely so that all of that work that we do in Washington can be discontinued. They\u2019ll pay tax, but they\u2019ll pay tax when they start making a certain amount of income. \nBy lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions and millions of new jobs. \nIn addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and close special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle-class taxpayer. They will receive the biggest benefit and it won\u2019t even be close. \nThey have been forgotten. We are not going to forget them. They have built our country. We will not forget. This is a working...thank you. \nThis is a working and middle-class tax relief proposal. \nThe tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my child care proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka. \nThese proposals are central and a very, very powerful central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan. \nFamilies will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents. \nBecause this deduction is capped, it will be disproportionately and it will benefit working and middle-class families. Gotta take care of our middle-class families. \nThe less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation. \nParents will also be able to enroll a tax-free, dependent care saving account for their children or elderly relatives. \nLow-income households will benefit from both an expanded earned income tax credit in the form of child care rebates and a matching $500 contribution for their saving account. \nA married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill. That\u2019s a tremendous saving and they\u2019ll have a better life. \nA married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill from what they\u2019re paying right now. \nBy contrast, someone earning $5 million, like the people in this room, will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all. \nOne of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate, down from the current 35% rate. \nThey\u2019re cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks and whites, Latinos. \nAbove everything else, they\u2019re Americans. Some are rich Americans. Some are poor Americans. They\u2019re Americans. \nThey love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future. \nThese are the forgotten men and women of our country and they have been forgotten. \nPeople who work hard but don\u2019t have a voice. \nI\u2019m running to be their voice and to fight and bring prosperity to every part of this country. \nToo many of our leaders have forgotten that it\u2019s their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any consideration, before anything. We have to do that. \nI\u2019m not running to be the president of the world. I\u2019m running to be president of the United States of America. \nAnd as your president, I will fight for every last American job and every American company, which really a lot of companies in this room I can tell you. We\u2019re going to be fighting for you because you\u2019re bringing the jobs. \nWe\u2019re a nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal and won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon. \nIt\u2019s time to start thinking big once again. \nThat\u2019s why I believe it\u2019s time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth. \nAnd my great economists don\u2019t want me to say this but I think we can do better than that. Now, they\u2019re upset. They\u2019ll be very upset. But I think we can do and maybe substantially better than that. \nIn working with my economic team, we\u2019ve put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal. \nOver the next 10 years, our economic team estimates that under our plan, the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs. \nYou can visit our website. Just look at the math. It works. \nThis growth means that our jobs and plans including our child care reforms that Ivanka Trump, my daughter is so involved in. I like her too. Will be completely paid for in combination with proposed budget savings. It will be deficit neutral. \nIf we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit. It will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy, and trade policies. \nRight now, under the Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1% last quarter \u2013 a number that was shocking to people that do this professionally and for life. It translates into millions of lost jobs and certainly millions of lost good jobs because we don\u2019t have good jobs anymore. Those jobs are gone and going. \nThis is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression. \nOver the last seven years, the economy grew only 2.1% \u2013 the slowest period in 70, 7-0, 70 years. \nHad the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs. \nPerhaps most shockingly, one in six men aged 18 to 34 are either in jail or out of work. \nMeanwhile, another two million Hispanic Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty. \nOn top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt. \nIt can happen. Failing schools can become flourishing schools. Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investments. And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities. \nAll of these things and so much more are possible. \nBut to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism which \u2013 it\u2019s just taken so many jobs out of our communities and so much wealth out of our countries. And replace it with a new policy of Americanism. \nAmerica first, remember that. \nUnder this American system, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: Does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans? It\u2019s a test. \nIf we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations \u2013 and we have to do that \u2013 unleash the vast strategy of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America first, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash. \nAmerica will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest higher, grow, and to create new jobs, new technologies and entire new industries. \nInstead \u2013 thank you \u2013 instead of driving jobs and welt away, America will become a great magnet for innovation and job creation. \nMy opponent\u2019s plan rejects this optimism. She offers only more taxing, and her tax increases are unbelievable. More regulating, more spending, and more wealth re-distribution. \nA future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity. \nThe only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton are the donors and the special interests but bad for our country. \nIn Hillary Clinton\u2019s America, we have surrendered our status as the world\u2019s great economy. And we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries. We take care of them better than we take care of ourselves. \nNot one single idea she\u2019s got will create one net American job or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers. \nThe only thing she can offer is a welfare check. That\u2019s about it. \nOur plan will create paychecks, and they\u2019re going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed or under-employed. \nIn the course of this campaign, I\u2019ve traveled all across the country, and I\u2019ve met the most amazing people. \nEveryday I\u2019ve seen the goodness and character of our country and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances. I have been all over this country, folks, and we have unbelievable people, but they need leadership. \nThe country needs leadership. \nIn many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end. \nI\u2019ve visited cities and towns in upstate New York, where half of the jobs have left and moved to Mexico and other countries. The businesses are gone. They\u2019ve been taken away like taking candy from a baby. \nPoliticians have abandoned these places all over the country. And the people who live there, are just there. No hope. \nWorse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans. \nMy opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as \u201cdeplorable:\u201d and \u201cirredeemable\u201d, just last week. \nSo how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens \u2013 tremendous, tremendous numbers of them \u2013 beyond redemption? \nThe hard working people she calls \u2018deplorable\u2019, are the most admirable people I know. \n...Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. It\u2019s a great honor to be with you and we had some really incredible things happen today. \nThe polls are coming out. We\u2019re leading in so many polls. I can\u2019t tell you, I don\u2019t where to begin. But that\u2019s a good feeling. \nI guess, CNN just came out. We\u2019re leading nationwide with CNN. We\u2019re leading in Ohio and we\u2019re leading in, I think, it just came out, we\u2019re leading in North Carolina, Florida. We\u2019re leading and we\u2019re having a lot of fun. We\u2019re having a lot of fun on the campaign and on the trail. \nI just wanted to say that there\u2019s always a lot of fun when you come up and the people don\u2019t have the teleprompter working but that\u2019s okay. Lucky I brought some notes. \nBut today, I do want to outline a plan for American economic revival, and it\u2019s a bold and ambitious and forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, income and opportunities for the people of our country \u2013 great people of our country \u2013 I will tell you. \nMy plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden and will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams. \nRight now, 92 million Americans are on the sideline outside of the workforce, and they\u2019re not a part of our economy. It\u2019s a silent nation of jobless Americans. \nAnd look no further and I mean, no further. \nAll you have to do is look at Flint, where I spent a lot of time. The city of Flint and what a disaster has taken place. \nThe jobs have been stripped from the community and its infrastructure has totally collapsed. \nIn 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for General Motors. Today, it\u2019s less than $8,000. We have 8,000 people and that\u2019s going down and they\u2019re making very, very little. And people are trying to go down to that $8,000 mark. \nWhat we\u2019re doing is, Ford has announced just yesterday, that they\u2019re moving their small car production facilities to Mexico. \nAnd I\u2019ve been talking about this a long while and I think that\u2019s maybe one of the reasons that we\u2019re doing so well in Ohio and Michigan and lots of other places where cars and parts are involved. \nBut to think that Ford is moving its small car division is a disgrace. It\u2019s disgraceful. It\u2019s disgraceful that our politicians allow them to get away with it. Really is. \nIt used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn\u2019t drink the water in Mexico. Now, cars are made in Mexico and you can\u2019t drink the water in Flint. \nBut we\u2019re going to turn this around. \nMy economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving and that our economy can never grow as it did once before. And boy, oh boy, did it used to grow. \nWe reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise and that\u2019s all there is really left to divide because frankly, we\u2019re looking at an economy now of no growth and redistribution of wealth. And that\u2019s not going to work. \nEverything that is broken today can be fixed and every failure can be turned into a truly great success. \nJust look at the way I just noted into the teleprompter that just went on. Who else could have pulled that off, okay? Who else? \nJobs can stop leaving our country and they will just absolutely start pouring in. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Detroit", "text": "We\u2019re one nation, and when anyone hurts, we all hurt together, and that\u2019s so true. So true. \nWe\u2019re all brothers and sisters, and we\u2019re all created by the same God. \nWe must love each other and support each other. And we are in this all together. All together. \nI fully understand that the African-American community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right. They will be made right. \nI want to make America prosperous for everyone. I want to make this city the economic envy of the world. We can do that. We can do that again. \nFactories everywhere, new roads and bridges, new schools. Especially schools. And new hope. \nI have been so greatly blessed, and in so many ways, with no greater blessing, than my family. I have a great family. \nNothing would make me happier and more fulfilled than to use what I have learned in business and in traveling all over the world. I\u2019ve sort of seen a lot. To bring the wealth and prosperity and opportunity to those to who have not had these opportunities before. And that\u2019s many, many people in Detroit. \nWhen I see wages falling, people out of work, I know the hardships this inflicts. And I am determined to do something it. I will do something about it. I do get things done. I wrote that. \nSome people have strengths, that\u2019s one of mine. I get things done. I\u2019ll get things done for you. \nPlease know this, for any who had heard it. Things are going to turn around. Tomorrow will be better. Be much better. \nThe pastor and I were talking about riding up the street, and we see all those closed stores, and people sitting down on the sidewalk, and no jobs and no activity. \nWe\u2019ll get it turned around. We\u2019ll get it turned around, pastor. Believe me. \nWe\u2019re going to win again as a country. And we\u2019re going to win again for all of our people. \nI want to work with you to renew the bonds of trust between citizens. And the bonds of faith that make our nation strong. \nAmerica\u2019s been lifted out of many of its most difficult hours through the miracle of faith and through people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson. So important. People have no idea how important they are. \nNow in these hard times for our country, let us turn again to our Christian heritage to lift up the soul of our nation. \nI am so deeply grateful to be here today. \nAnd it is my prayer that America, of tomorrow. And I mean that. That the America of tomorrow will be one of unity, togetherness and peace. And perhaps we can add the word, prosperity. Great prosperity. \nI\u2019d like to conclude with a passage from 1st John Chapter 4. \nYou know it. See, most groups I speak to don\u2019t know that. But we know it. \nIf you want, we can say it together. \nNo one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us. And his love is made, complete in us. \nAnd that\u2019s so true. \nThank you very much. This has been such an honor. \nThank you very much. \nI will have chance to discuss school choice. That\u2019s very important. And how to put every American on the ladder of success with a great education and a great job. \nBut today I just want to let you know that I am here to listen to you and I have been doing that. \nWe had a fantastic interview with Bishop Jackson. It was really an amazing interview. He\u2019s better than the people who do that professionally. \nAnd I didn\u2019t really know what I was getting myself into. I didn\u2019t know. Is this going to be nice? Is this going to be wild? He is a great gentlemen and a very smart guy. \nAnd I just hope you do not lose him to Hollywood. That\u2019s the only problem. Especially Dr. Jackson. She may be gone. Hollywood is calling. Look at all those television cameras back there. Look at all those television cameras. \nI am sorry to do that to you Bishop because you know, one of those things. Right? \nOur nation is too divided. We talk past each other, not to each other. \nAnd those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what is going on. They don\u2019t know. They have no clue. \nI am here today to learn so that we can together remedy injustice in any form and so that we can also remedy economics so that the African-American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different ways. \nOur political system has failed the people and works only to enrich itself. \nI want to reform that system so that it works for you, everybody in this room. \nI believe true reform can only come from outside the system. I really mean that. \nBeing a business man is much different from being a politician because I understand what is happening, and we are going outside of the establishment. \nBecoming the nominee of the party of Abraham Lincoln \u2013 a lot of people do not realize that Abraham Lincoln, the great Abraham Lincoln, was a Republican \u2013 has been the greatest honor of my life. \nIt is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the party, but more importantly the future of the country and the community. \nI believe we need a civil rights agenda for our time \u2013 one that ensures our rights to a great education; it\u2019s so important, and the right to live in safety and in peace and to have a really, really great job, a good paying job and one that you love to go to every morning. And that can happen. We need to bring our companies back. \nIt also means the right to have a government that protects our workers and fights, really fights, for our jobs. \nI want to help you build and rebuild Detroit. And we can do that, especially with people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson. It has been an amazing experience. It\u2019s been an amazing experience. \nNothing is more sad than when we sideline young black men with unfulfilled potential, tremendous potential. \nI met some people this morning that were incredible people and they looking for jobs. These are incredible people, young people. \nOur whole country loses out when we\u2019re unable to harness the brilliance and the energy of these folks. \n...Well, I just wrote this the other day knowing I\u2019d be here and I mean it from the heart and I\u2019d like to just read it and I think you\u2019ll understand it maybe better than I do in certain ways. \nFor centuries, the African-American church has been the conscience of our country, so true. \nIt\u2019s from the pews and pulpits, teachings of black churches all across this land that the civil Rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation. \nIt\u2019s from these pews that our nation has been inspired toward a better moral character and deeper concern for mankind and spirit of charity and unity that binds us all together and we are bound together and I see that today. This has been an amazing day for me. \nThe African-American faith community has been one of God\u2019s greatest gifts to America and to its people. \nThere is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide greater platform to the black churches and church goers. \nYou do right every day by your community and your families. You raise children in the light of God. \nAnd I will always support your church, always and defend your right to worship. So important. \nI am here today to listen to your message and I hope my presence here will also help your voice to reach new audiences in our country and many of these audiences desperately need your spirit and your thought, I can tell you that. \nChristian faith is not the past but the present and the future. Make it stronger. \nAnd we\u2019ll open it up to great, great, leaders like Pastor Jackson, Bishop Jackson, Dr. Jackson and so many others and so many others actually sitting here. \nDarrell Scott, we have, who is phenomenal, who has been with me for so long, so long. \nOmarosa, who is also a very nice person, but I don\u2019t want to say that because I\u2019ll destroy her image by saying that. She\u2019s actually a very, very, very fine person and a pastor. \nAnd I just want to thank all of the folks and there is somebody that\u2019s been very special to me, Dr. Ben Carson, whose been, stand up Ben, come here. This is a great man and a great guy. \nSo as I prepare to campaign all across the nation and in every community, I will have an opportunity to lay out my plans for economic change, which will be so good for Detroit and so good for this community because we are going to bring jobs back. I will have chance to bring them back. Taking them back from Mexico and everywhere else because they\u2019re gone.

It can be corrected with an act of Congress, probably doesn\u2019t even need that. \nA woman gets pregnant. She\u2019s nine months. She walks across the border.

It is a total disaster. \nWe\u2019ll pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs and lower taxes for everyone. \nAnd we are by the way the highest taxed nation in the world. Please remember that. \nWe will impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of the Secretary of State. \nThere is one common theme in all of these reforms. It\u2019s going to be America First. \nThis is why stakes in November are so great. \nOn Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people. The voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict. \nWe don\u2019t need or want another Clinton or Obama. We just can\u2019t take it anymore. So bad for our country and our people. \nCome November the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country, and I mean totally sold out their country. \nThey will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas, and enormous possibilities for the American people. \nHillary Clinton\u2019s message is old and tired. \nHer message is that things can\u2019t change. My message is that things have to change and that this is our one chance and maybe our only chance to do that change and if we don\u2019t do it now folks, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll ever ever have another chance. We have to have change but real change, not Obama change. \nAmericans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that build the great dams and so much more. \nThen we really started thinking small. Something happened. Something happened to our mentality. We stated thinking small. We stopped believing in what America could do and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions. We lost our sense of purpose and daring. But that\u2019s not who we are. \nCome this November, we can bring America back bigger and better and stronger than ever before. \nWe will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet Earth \u2013 the roads, the railways, and the airports of tomorrow. \nOur military, which has totally depleted, will have the best technology and the finest equipment. We will bring it back to the way that it must be \u2013 strong, strong, strong. \nMassive new factories will come roaring into our country, breathing life and hope into our communities. \nSo they probably have now a blackmail file over someone who wants to be the president of the United States. \nThis fact alone disqualifies her from the presidency. \nWe can\u2019t hand over our government to someone who\u2019s deepest darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies. Can\u2019t do it. \nNational security is also immigration security and Hillary wants neither. \nHillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States. She\u2019s pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days end virtually all immigration enforcement and thus create totally open borders for the United States. \nAnd by the way, 16,500 Border Patrol agents have endorsed Donald Trump \u2013 the first time in the history that they\u2019ve endorsed a presidential candidate. \nThe first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They\u2019re also the ones she will hurt the most by far. \nLet me share with you a letter our campaign received from Marianne [sp] Mendoza. She lost her amazing son, Police Sgt. Brandon [sp] Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigration because of open borders and policies supported by Hillary Clinton. \nSadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate. Here\u2019s an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza\u2019s letter: \u201cHillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she\u2019s willing to put each and everyone of our lives in harm\u2019s way \u2013 an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I. She\u2019s only concerned about the power of the presidency and the power that it would bring. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes that she\u2019s already committed against our country.\u201d That\u2019s from Mrs. Mendoza. \nHillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to settle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States on top of the current record level of immigration that we already have. \nFor the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America. \nHillary\u2019s Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor and unemployed Americans totally out of work. She can\u2019t claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage earners to compete against them and win against them because the system is rigged against our people. \nHere are a few things a Trump administration will do for the Americans and for the American people but for our country. \nNumber one, the first 100 days I will appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution of the United States. \nHillary Clinton\u2019s radical judges will virtually abolish the Second Amendment. Can\u2019t let that happen. \nI will change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good \u2013 really good paying jobs. We don\u2019t have good jobs anymore. These will be good-paying jobs. \nWe\u2019ll stand up to countries that cheat on trade of which there are many. We\u2019ll cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas everywhere else but our country. \nThe father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan \u2013 one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-woman regimes on Earth. \nI only want to admit people who share our values and love our people. \nHillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death. \nMaybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department. \nHillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States. \nHere is some of what we really learned from the book in addition to what we\u2019ve already discussed. \nA foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran and other oppressive regimes. \nSo what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech. \nThe Clintons got their cash; the telecom company escaped all sanctions. \nHillary Clinton\u2019s State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America\u2019s uranium holdings while non-investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. $145 million. \nHillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access even though he had no national security credentials, although he did make a very large campaign contribution. \nHillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State plus millions more for her foundation. The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive sharia law, including the punishment by death and stoning if you happen to be gay. \nThe government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. \nHillary Clinton\u2019s book \u2013 and just think of this. The book talks about it but Hillary took $25 million from Saudi Arabia and much more from others where being gay is also punishable by death. \nHillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and many other countries that horribly abused women and the LGBT citizens. \nTo cover up her corrupt dealings, Hillary illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server. \nShe\u2019s under investigation but it seems like nothing is going to happen even though other people who have done similar things but at a much lower level their lives have been destroyed. It\u2019s a rigged system, folks. It\u2019s a rigged system. \nHer server was easily hacked by foreign governments, perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China. Sure they have it. Putting all of America and our citizens in danger \u2013 great danger. \nThen there are the 33,000 emails she deleted. While we may not know what\u2019s in those deleted emails, our enemies probably know every single one of them. \nHere\u2019s what one of the victims\u2019 mother had to say, \u201cI want the whole to know it. She lied to my face, and you know this person cannot be president. She cannot be president.\u201d \nIn 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world. Libya was cooperating. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence, believe it or not. Syria was under control. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel \u2013 something very nice because by the way, Israel has been totally mistreated by the United States. ISIS wasn\u2019t even on the map. \nFast-forward to 2013. In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed to almost singlehandedly destabilize the entire Middle East. \nHer invasion of Libya handed the country over to ISIS, the barbarians. \nThanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East and on the road to nuclear weapons. \nHillary Clinton\u2019s support for a violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West. \nShe helped force out a friendly regime in Europe and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has re-taken control but Clinton has opened the pandora\u2019s box of radical Islam. \nThen there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS and the ISIS killers. \nISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama. \nISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims throughout the Middle East and peaceful Muslims across the world who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety. \nIn short, Hillary Clinton\u2019s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another. One by one, they\u2019re all bad. She\u2019s virtually done nothing right. She\u2019s virtually done nothing good. \nIt all started with her bad judgment in supporting the war in Iraq in the first place. \nThough I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war and, yes, even before the war ever started. \nBut Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq because when she got into power she couldn\u2019t wait to rush us off to war in Libya. \nShe lacks the temperament and the judgment and the competence to lead our country. She should not be president under any circumstances. \nIn the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office \u2013 somebody that saw her a lot and knows her probably better than almost anybody \u2013 \u201cShe simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office.\u201d \nFrom the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true. Her leadership style \u2013 volcanic, impulsive, disdainful and disdainful of the rules set for everyone else hasn\u2019t changed one bit. \nPerhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton\u2019s foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by radical Islam. \nIn fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States and that\u2019s an increase over President Obama\u2019s already high number. \nUnder her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth with no way to screen who they are, what they are, what they believe, where they come from. \nAlready, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the United States. \nThe book, Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweizer documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America\u2019s expense. She gets rich making you poor. \nHere is a quote from the book: \u201cAt the center of U.S. policy towards China was Hillary Clinton. At this critical time, for U.S.-China relations Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters. These funds were paid to the Clinton\u2019s bank account directly while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.\u201d \nTell me, folks, does that work? \nShe sold out our workers and our country for Beijing. Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas and give up congressional power to an international foreign commission. \nNow, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she\u2019s pretending that she\u2019s against it. She\u2019s given and deleted as you know \u2013 most people have heard about this. Have we ever heard about her deleting anything? No, I don\u2019t think so. She deleted the entire record from her book and deletion is something she really does know something about because she\u2019s deleted at least 30,000 emails, which by the way, should be able to be found. \nShould be able to be found because the government, I will say, I\u2019ve always heard you can never really delete an email. So it should be able to be found if they really want to find them but I don\u2019t think they want to find them. \nThis is the latest Clinton cover-up and it doesn\u2019t change anything. \nIf she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. \nShe will do this and just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade on every single stage of her career and it will be even worse than the Clintons\u2019 NAFTA deal, and I never thought it would get worse than that. \nWe will lose jobs. We will lose employment. We will loses taxes...everything. We will lose our country. \nI want trade deals but they have to be great for the United States and for our workers. We don\u2019t make great deals anymore but we will once I become president. I promise you that. \nIt\u2019s not just our economy that\u2019s been corrupted but our foreign policy too. \nThe Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions and trillions of dollars and unleashed ISIS across the world. \nNo Secretary of State has been more wrong more often and in more places than Hillary Clinton. \nHer decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched. \nAmong the victims of our late ambassador Chris Stevens. I mean, she \u2013 what she did with him was absolutely horrible. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed. \nThat\u2019s right. When the phone rang as per the commercial at 3 a.m. Hillary Clinton was sleeping. Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds and hundreds of requests for security. They were desperate. They needed help. \nHillary Clinton\u2019s State Department refused them all. She started the war that put them in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die. \nTo cover her tracks, Hillary lied about the videos being the cause of death. The famous video. All a lie. Another Hillary lie. \nThe choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests or surrendering really the last scrap of independence to the total and complete control of people like the Clintons. Those are the stakes. \nHillary Clinton wants to be president but she doesn\u2019t have the temperament or as Bernie Sanders says very strongly the judgment to be president. She does not have the judgment. \nShe believes she\u2019s entitled to the office. Her campaign slogan is \u201cI\u2019m with her.\u201d You know what my response is to that? I\u2019m with you \u2013 the American people. \nThank you very much. \nShe thinks it\u2019s all about her. I know it\u2019s all about you. I know it\u2019s all about making America great again for all Americans \u2013 all Americans. \nOur country lost its way when it stopped putting the American people really first. We have to go back to putting our American people first. \nWe got here because we switched from the policy of Americanism, focusing on what\u2019s good for America\u2019s middle class to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy itself. \nWe reward companies for off-shoring and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed. They get punished. \nThis is not a rising tide that lifts all boats. This is a wave of globalism that wipes our middle class and our jobs along with it. \nWe need reform and we have to reform our economic system so that once again we can all succeed together and America can become rich again. We have to make America rich again. \nAnd that\u2019s what I mean by America First. Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to the shores. I mean, we have to bring our manufacturers back to the United States. Desperately need it. Desperately we need those jobs. And we need it even from our psyche. \nOne of the really great things and one of the first major bills that George Washington was \u2013 amazing when I saw this for the first time \u2013 the encouragement and protection of manufacturing in America. \nOur first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying \u201cThe abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.\u201d \nIn other words, we have to protect our country. I have decided and visited cities and towns across America \u2013 all across America \u2013 and seen the devastations caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton and it\u2019s total devastation \u2013 all over New York, all over Pennsylvania, all over New England, all over the country. \nHillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton\u2019s disastrous \u2013 and totally disastrous \u2013 NAFTA just like she supported China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade Organization. \nWe\u2019ve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed. Among the worst we\u2019ve ever done, among the most destructive agreements we\u2019ve ever signed. \nOur trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton\u2019s time as Secretary of State \u2013 a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated but rather scorned. \nThen she left China \u2013 so true. The she left China and what happened is billions and billions of dollars in our intellectual property and China has taken it and it\u2019s a crime which is continuously going on and it\u2019s going on right now. \nThey are stealing billions and billions of dollars of our intellectual property. \nHillary Clinton gave China millions of jobs \u2013 our best jobs \u2013 and effectively let China completely rebuild itself. In return Hillary Clinton got rich. \nThe insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money. \nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re asking Bernie Sanders\u2019s voters to join our movement so together we can fix the system for all Americans. So important. \nThis includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals and they are disastrous. They\u2019re destroying our country because it\u2019s not the political system that\u2019s rigged, it\u2019s the whole economy. \nIt\u2019s rigged by big donors who want to keep wages down. \nIt\u2019s rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire their workers and sell their products back into the United States with absolutely no consequences for them. \nIt\u2019s rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools. \nIt\u2019s rigged against you \u2013 the American people. \nHillary Clinton \u2013 and as you know, she \u2013 most people know she\u2019s a world class liar. Just look at her pathetic email statements or her phony landing. \nOr her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack and the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers \u2013 a total and \u2013 look, this was one the beauts \u2013 a total and self-serving lie. \nBrian Williams\u2019s career was destroyed for saying less. Just remember that. \nYesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses but here \u2013 and this is the way it is \u2013 is the bottom line. \nI started off in Brooklyn, New York, not so long ago with a small loan and built a business that today is worth well over $10 billion. \nAnd that\u2019s the kind of thinking we need in our leadership of our country. \nI\u2019ve always had a talent of building businesses and importantly for creating jobs. That\u2019s a talent our country desperately needs. \nI\u2019m running for president to end the unfairness and to put you the American worker first. It\u2019s about time. \nWe\u2019re going to put America first and we\u2019re going to make America great again. This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people or by the politicians. \nHere is my promise to the American voter. If I\u2019m elected president, I will end the special interests monopoly in Washington, D.C. Very important. \nThe other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests and I will tell you she\u2019s made plenty of money for them and she\u2019s been taking plenty of money out for herself. \nHillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft. \nShe ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund doing favors oppressive regimes and many others and really many, many others in exchange for cash. Pure and simple, folks. Pure and simple. \nThen when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests and in less than two years secret speeches that she does not want to reveal under any circumstances to the public. I wonder why. \nTogether, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001. \nThey total own her and that will never, ever change, including if she ever became president. God help us. \nToday I\u2019d like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this upcoming and important election. \nPeople have asked me why I\u2019m running for president. I\u2019ve built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side by side with my children every single day. \nWe come to work together and turn visions into reality. We think big and then we make it happen. We absolutely make it happen. \nI love what I do and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it. \nSo when people ask me why I am running, I very quickly answer I\u2019m running to give back to this country which has been so very good to me. \nWhen I see the crumbling roads and bridges or the dilapidated airports or the factories moving overseas to Mexico or to other countries for that matter, I know these problems can all be fixed but not by Hillary Clinton. Only by me. \nThe fact is we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before. Jobs, jobs, jobs. \nEverywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can\u2019t solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created the problems themselves. We\u2019ll never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who have rigged it in the first place. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks on his multiple bankruptcies at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015", "text": "Question:\n...You talk a lot about how you are the person on this stage to grow the economy. I want to ask you about your business record. \nTrump corporations \u2013 Trump corporations \u2013 casinos and hotels have declared bankruptcy four times over the last quarter century. \nIn 2011, you told Forbes Magazine this: \u201cI\u2019ve used the laws of the country to my advantage.\u201d \nBut at the same time, financial experts involved in those bankruptcies say that lenders to your companies lost billions of dollars. \nQuestion, sir, with that record, why should we trust you to run the nation\u2019s business? \nI have never gone bankrupt by the way. I have never. \nBut I\u2019ve had hundreds of deals \u2013 \nQuestion:\n...But your companies have gone bankrupt. \nBut the difference is when somebody else uses those laws, nobody writes about it. When I use it, they say, \u201cOh, Trump, Trump, Trump.\u201d \nThe fact is I built a net worth of more than $10 billion. I have a great, great company. I employ thousands of people. And I\u2019m very proud of the job I did. \nAgain...hundreds and hundreds of deals, four times I\u2019ve taken advantage of the laws and frankly so has everybody else in my position. \nQuestion:\nWell, sir, let\u2019s just talk about the latest example, which is Trump Entertainment Resorts, which went bankrupt in 2009. In that case alone, lenders to your company lost over $1 billion and more than 1,100 people were laid off. Is that the way that you\u2019d run the country? \nThese are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, okay? I mean, you know, you\u2019re living in a world of the make-believe...if you want to know the truth. \nI had the good sense to leave Atlantic City, which by the way, Caesar\u2019s just went bankrupt, every company \u2013 Chris can tell you \u2013 every company virtually in Atlantic City went bankrupt. Every company. \nAnd let me just tell you. I had the good sense, and I\u2019ve gotten a lot of credit in the financial pages. Seven years ago, I left Atlantic City before it totally cratered, and I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and I\u2019m very proud of it. I want to tell you that. Very, very proud of it. \nBy the way, this country, right now, owes $19 trillion and they need somebody like me to straighten out that mess. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks in South Carolina", "text": "And Kate [Steinle] from San Francisco. Obama calls everybody and he sends groups over and sends Attorney Generals over and does investigations. Tremendous, you know, everything at the funerals. \nKate from San Francisco. The parents never got a call. Killed by an illegal alien as we\u2019ve discussed before. Never got a call. Never got. \nWould you think like \u201cMan, it\u2019s terrible\u201d? \n...Nothing is going to bring her back but you\u2019d think it would be nice if he called. \nSo it\u2019s a very, very sad situation for our country. Our country is doing very poorly. \nThe real unemployment rate is probably 21%. Some people think it\u2019s much higher than that. You know, this 5.3% and 5.5%. It\u2019s total non \u2013 you know, you give up looking for a job and you\u2019re considered employed. It\u2019s a total joke. \nBunch of clowns. Bunch of real clowns. \nBut we probably have 21%. \nA report came out two weeks ago and said it\u2019s actually 42%. The real rate is actually 42%. Could be. But I\u2019m saying 19% to 21%. \nWe have negative growth. We have every country that we do business with looks at us as a patsy, stupid, stupid people. And everybody is ripping us left and right, no matter whether it\u2019s militarily, whether it\u2019s with ISIS. \nI mean, we can\u2019t beat ISIS. Tell that to Gen. Douglas MacArthur, we can\u2019t beat ISIS. Tell that to Gen. George Patton. \u201cOh General, we can\u2019t beat ISIS.\u201d Okay? \nDid you ever see Obama at a news conference explaining when and where we\u2019re going to raid the enemy? \u201cIn two weeks, we\u2019re going in through the back\u201d. \nI\u2019m saying can you imagine George Patton lying in his grave. He\u2019s spinning like a saucer. \u201cI can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m hearing.\u201d \nAnd then they said, \u201cOh good. That\u2019s smart because that\u2019s camouflage.\u201d \nAnd he does it and it turns out to be a tough battle because they\u2019re ready. \nWe need smart leader. We need brilliant leadership. We have to make America great again. \nThank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. \nSo I said, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you bringing this up and not letting them have all this money?\u201d And they didn\u2019t want to do that either. They didn\u2019t want to complicate it. \nThis is the most incredible. \nAnd then of course we\u2019re fighting them between Yemen, you know, where they\u2019re representing the other side very successfully by the way and other places. \nAnd they didn\u2019t want to talk about the various hot spots because they didn\u2019t want to complicate the negotiations. \nAnd you know there\u2019s a bad signal when you go across and you see on television the Iranian chief negotiator he goes home and they\u2019re celebrating him in the streets. Right? They\u2019re having parades. They\u2019re honoring him. \n...We\u2019re like a bunch of slobs. We\u2019re like a bunch of dopes. \nWe should have doubled up the sanctions, maybe tripled up the sanctions, sat back for about three months and let them call us. And believe me, I would have made one hell of a deal. That one\u2019s easy. That one\u2019s easy. \nSo it\u2019s very, very sad. \nAnd a lot of people think the reason I\u2019m doing so well in polls \u2013 made a very good Iowa poll yesterday. But that I\u2019m doing so well in the polls is that when North Carolina comes in \u2013 your neighbors \u2013 and I\u2019m killing everybody in North Carolina. Hopefully, I\u2019m going to do great in South Carolina... \n...But when I do great in North Carolina, when I do great in Nevada, which just came out and I won the Hispanic vote. I won big league \u2013 the Hispanics. I\u2019m telling you. \nThere is something happening. You know, there used to be the expression \u2013 many of you have heard it...the silent majority. There\u2019s a silent majority out there. We\u2019re tired of being pushed around, kicked around, and acting and being led by stupid people. They\u2019re stupid people. \nI mean, you have a President who can\u2019t just say a few words: Put the flag at half mast for the five Marines that were just killed. Why? Why? Why? \nI mean, think of it. How easy. It\u2019s almost like \u201cDoe he read the papers? Does he watch television?\u201d \nEvery television. Whether it\u2019s Fox or CNN or MS \u2013 any of them. They\u2019re all talking about it. Like, \u201cOh, gee well.\u201d \n...Just put them at half mast for a week. These people were great. They never had a chance. \nThis gun-free zone nonsense. We\u2019ve got to stick up for that Second Amendment. This gun-free zone \u2013 these guys never, ever had a chance. \nAnd by the way, a couple of them, big, big decorations \u2013 decorated, tremendous, unbelievable, young, brilliant people \u2013 gone. They never had a chance. A gun-free zone. And they\u2019re trained with weapons. It\u2019s not like \u201cOh gee, it\u2019s not good to have\u201d. They\u2019re trained. These are the best...They were sitting ducks. They never had a chance because of the stupidity. \nWe have to get rid of that whole gun-free zone nonsense and just stop it. \nYou know, in some of the communities, our recruiting stations and recruiting areas, they actually have civilians surrounding \u2013 can you believe this? \u2013 civilians surrounding that are armed to protect the military soldiers that are our best and finest. And they\u2019re in there and they don\u2019t have guns. So we have civilians surrounding. This is what our country\u2019s come to. \nBut if I can bring wealth in so that we can save your Social Security without cuts \u2013 all the Republicans are talking about \u201cWe\u2019re going to cut. We\u2019re going to raise the age. We\u2019re going to do this. Your Medicare, your Medicaid, your Social Security.\u201d \nBut I\u2019m the only one who knows how to do it and the way you do it is you have to make our country vibrant so that we can afford it. \nRight now we can\u2019t afford it. \nOur GDP went down in the first quarter. Like down. \nChina went up to 7% and they\u2019re beside themselves \u201cHow come it only went up 7%?\u201d \nAnd China \u2013 one year ago it was announced, China now is the number one in the world. You know that? Economically, from the standpoint that so matters. China. It\u2019s unthinkable. \nWe\u2019ve allowed them. But it\u2019s our money. \nI mean, I love Apple. But where are they made? What do they have? They have an office here and all the workers are over there. We\u2019ve got to change it around. We\u2019ve got to incentivize them so that we make Apple and all the other things, they\u2019ve got to be made here. \nAnd if China isn\u2019t treating us fairly, we have all the cards. The administration doesn\u2019t know this. \nIf they\u2019re taxing and we\u2019re not taxing, which they do by the way, then we have to make sure that they pay a penalty and they will stop immediately. And if they don\u2019t stop, we\u2019ll get rich on receiving taxes from them. And we don\u2019t even want to bring up the word. \nSo we\u2019re going to save your Social Security. We\u2019re going to make it strong and solid. \nMedicare, Medicaid, we\u2019re going to stop the waste and the abuse and the fraud that goes on. \nWe\u2019re going to make proper deals. People mention the Iran deal as an example. What kind of a deal is this? What kind of a deal? \nI mean, I\u2019ve seen one-sided deals before. This is like Sergeant [Bowe] Bergdahl. We get a traitor \u2013 a no good rotten traitor like Bergdahl \u2013 and they get five killers that they most wanted in the whole world who are right now back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody, including us. Okay? What kind of a deal is this? \nNot good. Right? \n...A lousy deal. But we only make lousy deals. I call Obama the 5 for 1 President. We get Bergdahl; they get five guys that they dreamed of. \nAnd that\u2019s the problem. \nSo the Iran deal \u2013 any time, anywhere, we want to be able to inspect. They got 24 days and notice provisions and all. By the time, it could be months and months and months. By that time it\u2019s gone. \nBut you know what irks me? Look, having nuclear. My uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer. Dr. John Trump at MIT. Good genes. Very good genes, okay? The Wharton School of Finance. Very good. Very smart. \nYou know, if you\u2019re a conservative Republican \u2013 if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I\u2019m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world. It\u2019s true. \nBut when you\u2019re a conservative Republican, they try \u2013 oh, do they do a number...That\u2019s why I always start \u2013 went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, build a fortune. You know, I have to give my credentials all the time because we\u2019re a little disadvantaged. \nBut you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me \u2013 it would have been so easy. And it\u2019s not as important as these lives are \u2013 nuclear is so powerful. \nMy uncle explained that to me many, many years ago the power and that was 35 years ago. He would explain the power of what was going to happen and he was right. Who would have thought? \nBut when you look at what\u2019s going on with the four prisoners. Now, it used to be three. Now it\u2019s four. But when it was three and even now I would have said it\u2019s all in the messenger. \nFellas. And it is fellas because you know they haven\u2019t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men. So you know, it\u2019s going to take them about another 150 years. \nBut the Persians are great negotiators. The Iranians are great negotiators. And they just killed. They just killed us. This is horrible. \nBut I would have said at the beginning, \u201cFellas, you\u2019ve got to let our prisoners go. Look, you don\u2019t need them. You don\u2019t want them. It would send a great signal to the United States and it would make the rest of it easier.\u201d \nNothing. We get nothing. We don\u2019t the prisoners. \nAnd Kerry said the other day and so did Obama \u2013 we didn\u2019t want to negotiate and complicate the negotiations. \nWhat\u2019s complicated? Say, \u201cExcuse me, we have four prisoners. We\u2019d like to have them please.\u201d Okay? \n\u201cOh, it\u2019s too complicated.\u201d This is crazy. \nThen we\u2019re giving them billions and billions and billions of dollars. We shouldn\u2019t give it to them. It should have been off the table. Why are we giving them? \nSo with the vets, I will get things fixed because that\u2019s what I do. I make things better. \n...We have to make our country better. We have to make our country stronger. And we have to make our country richer and we have to do it fast. We really have to do it fast because we don\u2019t have that much time left. \nWe have to change our mindset in the United States. \nNow, you know, I have a little statement \u2013 the American dream is dead. And to just show you how bad it is, the American dream is dead. But I\u2019m going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. \nBecause the press is very dishonest. And I say always, the American dream is dead but we\u2019re going to make it bigger and better and everyone stands up and they go crazy and they applaud. And I mean it. \nSo my wife goes the other day I\u2019m talking to her, she goes, \u201cOh darling. That was such a tough statement.\u201d \u201cWhat? What? I thought I did well.\u201d And they turned it on. They have on television \u2013 TiVo. They have \u201cThe American dream is dead.\u201d Cut. That\u2019s the end. That\u2019s a terrible segment. \nSo I say the American dream is dead. We\u2019re going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. I know how to do it. Politicians don\u2019t know how to do it. They don\u2019t know how to do it. \nAnd I am so tired of politicians. Nobody knows them better than me. I know them. I know them. I deal with them. \nIf you can\u2019t get rich dealing with politicians, there\u2019s something wrong with you. Honestly. I know them. \nThe problem is with politicians and this is almost all of them, not all of them but the problem with politicians it\u2019s perseverance. They work. They try. But they only want to keep their job. That\u2019s 99% of what they want. \nI get calls from Senators. Could we come and see you? You know, you have these campaign finance limits, which are actually a good thing...I even tell them \u2013 Senators call up, I send them a check \u2013 it\u2019s easier. I say don\u2019t bother. They want to fly from Washington to New York. I mean, how long. Come to my office and I\u2019m allowed to give them what, $2,600 or something. I mean, like a whole day is wasted. \nAnd I say this is what they do? And that\u2019s what they do from morning \u2019till night. \nAnd if you need something later on, they win their election or they lose their election, if you need something, you call them. They treat you great, like royalty. Like royalty. \nAnd a businessman, a businessperson knows the game. \nAnd what you look at, for instance, Jeb Bush. I\u2019m not a fan of Jeb Bush because Jeb Bush is in favor of Common Core and he\u2019s weak on immigration. Those are two bad things. I think he\u2019s a nice person actually. \nBut he\u2019s very in favor of Common Core, meaning he wants your children to be educated from Washington, D.C. by the bureaucrats. Okay? Not good. \nAnd he\u2019s very weak on immigration. \nAnd he\u2019s not a deal guy. He\u2019s not a deal maker. Who would you rather have negotiating in China, as an example? Trump or Jeb? \nOr Trump or Hillary? Okay, Hillary? She\u2019s another one with the tone. \nIsn\u2019t it amazing they both said tone the same day. It was about the tone but they both said it the same day. \nSo I am very excited about this. It\u2019s a very interesting situation that\u2019s taken place. \nWe had a poll come out yesterday \u2013 the Washington Post poll with ABC and it showed that I had an 11 point lead. That\u2019s faster than scheduled. That\u2019s faster than scheduled. \nI mean, that\u2019s the good news. The bad news is it drives people crazy. And I don\u2019t really know why. Because all I want to do is make our country great again. \nYou know, it\u2019s like aren\u2019t we all on the same track, whether you\u2019re a liberal, a Democrat, a conservative, a Republican, or all of them? I mean, aren\u2019t we all sort of on the same track? You want to make our country great. \nI know people that are Democrats that love our country. I know people that are liberals, believe it or not, that love our country. \nAnd if I can make phenomenal deals with China, which I will. I will, believe me. The best negotiators in the world, I know every one. I know the bad ones, good ones, the over-rated ones, the ones that you\u2019ve never heard of that are better than all of the ones you read them all. I know them all. \nI wrote the Art of the Deal. Right? We need the Art of the Deal. We need the Art. They never read it in this administration. They\u2019re the only people that didn\u2019t read it. \nAnd all over the world, all over the world, a friend of mine calls me from Paris. \u201cOh, Donald, it\u2019s so bad about losing NASCAR. I feel so badly for you.\u201d \nIt says, \u201cTrump loses NASCAR\u201d headlines in their business paper in Paris and he calls me up to pay his condolences. \nYou know what? It was a banquet at the Doral. It\u2019s a one-night banquet at the Doral. I\u2019ll rent it to somebody else for more money in about two seconds in Miami. \nThe next day, \u201cTrump loses ESPN\u201d, \u201cESPN severs ties with Trump\u201d. It was a golf outing for 120 golfers from ESPN at my course in Los Angeles. So now, they\u2019re going to go to a crummy course because this course is much better than the alternate. It\u2019s like not even a contest. So they\u2019ll play this crummy course. \nBy the way, they\u2019ll all be back next year. They already told me that. \u201cHey, Donald, we\u2019re going to get out for a year. We\u2019ll be back next year.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s okay.\u201d I keep their deposit. No, 100%. 100%. I keep their deposit and I rent it. So I get two for the price of one. We know what that feeling is. \nBut you know, all over the place. Still it\u2019s still a lot of money. \nThen I sued Univision and NBC. That\u2019s going to be easy. I mean, the whole thing is like ridiculous. So I give up a lot. \nBut this guy Lindsey Graham, he calls me a jackass this morning. \nAnd I said to myself, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s amazing. He doesn\u2019t seem like a very bright guy.\u201d Okay? He actually probably seems to me not as bright, honestly as Rick Perry. I think Rick Perry is probably smarter than Lindsey Graham. But what do I know? \nActually, I said about Rick Perry, he said that I shouldn\u2019t be debating my spirit is wrong for America. Okay? All I want to do is make us rich, save your Social Security, stop having everyone rip us off, and I have bad spirit, right? So he said, \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be allowed on the debate stage.\u201d \nAnd then I tweeted \u2013 you know I have many millions between Facebook and Twitter. It\u2019s great. It\u2019s like owning a newspaper without the losses. It\u2019s incredible. So I tweeted that Rick Perry should have to have an IQ test before getting on the debate stage. And people said I was tough. \nBut today, I got called a jackass by this guy. Then I said to myself, \u201cHey, didn\u2019t this guy call me like four years ago?\u201d Yes. He called me four years ago \u2013 three, four years ago. Lindsey Graham. I didn\u2019t even know who he was. \nHe goes, \u201cMr. Trump, this is Sen. Lindsey Graham. I wonder if it would be possible for you to call Fox\u201d...And he wanted to know whether or not I could give him a good reference on Fox and Friends. He wanted to know would I do that. And then of course he wanted to know whether or not if he could come and see if there\u2019s some campaign contributions. \nAnd you know, I give to everybody. People said, \u201cOh, you gave to the Democrats.\u201d Of course, I do. \u201cYou gave to the Republicans.\u201d \u201cYou gave to Hillary.\u201d \u201cYou gave here.\u201d Of course I do. I was a businessman until a few months ago. \nWhen I want something \u2013 and that\u2019s part of the problem with our system. Until a couple of months ago, I could have anything. Believe me. If a Republican wants, if a Democrat \u2013 I give. When I need something, I call. \u201cMr. Trump, sir, how are you? What can I do for you?\u201d I said \u201cNothing really. Be at my wedding. Make sure, please.\u201d Or whatever I want. \nPart of the problem \u2013 see, with me, I don\u2019t need anybody\u2019s money. Nobody has to give to me. People are sending me money anyways. I said you don\u2019t have to bother, please. Don\u2019t bother. Don\u2019t give me. I don\u2019t need money. I\u2019m doing it myself. \nSo when people come up to me and they say, \u201cMr. Trump, I\u2019d like you to do this\u201d which is good for him but bad for the country, I\u2019ll say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t do it.\u201d Folks, I\u2019m not doing it. I\u2019m only doing the right thing. \nSo Lindsey Graham says to me \u201cPlease, please whatever you can do.\u201d You know, I\u2019m saying to myself, \u201cWhat is this guy, a beggar?\u201d He\u2019s like begging me to help him with Fox and Friends. So I say, \u201cOkay and I\u2019ll mention your name.\u201d He said, \u201cCould you mention my name?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d \nAnd he gave me his number and I found the card. I wrote the number down. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right number. Let\u2019s try it. 202-228-0292. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s three, four years ago. So maybe it\u2019s an old number. 202-228-0292. I don\u2019t know. Give it a shot. Your local politician, you know? He won\u2019t fix anything but at least he\u2019ll talk to you. \nAnd by the way, Yemen \u2013 the war that Obama thought he won, remember a year ago? \u201cOh, Yemen, great! It\u2019s over. It\u2019s over.\u201d Well, about two weeks later it was gone. They took all our equipments. They took all our trucks. \nThink of this. We make 2,300 Humvees \u2013 armor-plated. The most incredible. As shots fired and the guys we gave them to \u2013 our allies \u2013 they run. One shot goes in the air, they run. \nSo the enemy takes over, 2,300 Humvees. \nNow, when I saw the numbers, I said, \u201cNo, no, no. Two or three, you mean? Not 2,000. You mean they took over two or three?\u201d \nNo, no. 2,300 armor-plated Humvees. Better than what we have. They were the best. The enemy has them. \nWe have such stupid leadership. \nAnd if you think that with Yemen, you take a look at that border with Saudi Arabia, if you think they\u2019re stopping at Yemen, they don\u2019t Yemen. They want the oil. They\u2019re going to go. That\u2019ll be next. \nJust like I predicted Iraq was going to be a disaster. I\u2019m the only one who said don\u2019t do Iraq. \nIf you look at Reuters July of 2004, headline \u201cTrump says \u2018Don\u2019t do Iraq\u2019\u201d. And I\u2019m the most militaristic person ever. \nI will not only do great things for our vets \u2013 and I will take care of our vets. Our vets are treated like third class citizens. \nBut I\u2019ll build \u2013 I will build a military that\u2019s so strong that we\u2019ll never have to use it because they\u2019re going to say, \u201cWe\u2019re not messing with that guy and we\u2019re not messing with that country.\u201d \nBecause our military is decimated. \nI\u2019m in the real estate business. All the time I get these listings. You know, a base, a naval base, an army base, a marine base. They\u2019re always for sale! I say how many bases can they sell? I mean, they\u2019re selling the bases. When you sell the bases, that means they\u2019re closing up. \nAnd right now, our military is the smallest it\u2019s been in decades and we need it like more than ever. \nAnd our vets are being treated worse than they\u2019ve ever been. So the waiting list. Worst than they\u2019ve ever been. \nThe waiting list as of this morning, I just saw a report \u2013 you know, they had the big thing when they had the scandal. Because this is the most corrupt thing you\u2019ve ever seen. \nAnd this is why I\u2019m angry at John McCain for two reasons. \nNumber one, John McCain \u2013 you\u2019ve got to remember this \u2013 he\u2019s totally about open borders and all of this stuff. \nAnd when I went to Arizona, he called these 15,000 unbelievable people \u2013 unbelievable. I know crazies, okay? I know crazies. These were unbelievable American people. \nAnd John McCain who I supported for President \u2013 I think I raised him over $1 million and he lost. So he can lose. I don\u2019t hold that against him. But I raised him a lot of money. But he called these people crazies. \nThere were so many they had to turn like I think 1,000 or 2,000 away like they did. I hear that they had to turn a lot of the people away. Even though they have the ante rooms all over the place, they had to turn people away. That\u2019s the kind of crowds we\u2019re getting. \nBut he said that. \nAnd today, I hear the waiting list is the longest it\u2019s ever been. I hear that it\u2019s worse than it\u2019s ever been. \nAnd two years ago, remember, in order to get rid of all of the problems they threw more money at it. \nBut when you have incompetent people at the top \u2013 and they put in a new guy but he\u2019s not the right guy. He doesn\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s doing according to everybody I know. He has no clue. \nI know the best people. I know the best managers. I know the best deal makers. I know people that will make us so strong. I know guys that are so good as managers. \nA lot of times a deal maker isn\u2019t a good manager. And then a manager isn\u2019t a good deal maker. \nBut you look at Obamacare with the $5 billion website and the wonderful former governor who\u2019s a wonderful woman didn\u2019t have clue. She didn\u2019t have a clue. It was a mess. \nSo how do you spend $5 billion on a website for something that has to be repealed and replaced with something much better? Has to be, has to be. \nWe have no choice. Because it\u2019s bad for the people. The premiums are going through the roof. \nThe deductibles are ridiculous. You\u2019re never going to use it unless you get hit by a Komatsu. It\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to use it. It\u2019s true. Not Caterpillar. We don\u2019t buy them any more, remember. \nSo this guy Lindsey Graham gets out and he\u2019s out there and he calls me a jackass. \nI\u2019m supposed to be \u2013 I\u2019m trying to be nice. You know, I\u2019m working hard to be nice. \nBut every time I turn on, I have some guy that is hitting me like hard. \nNow, the reason that they\u2019re hitting me in all fairness is when you register zero in the poll, what the hell, they have nothing to lose, right? \nAnd then I thought to myself about Lindsey Graham. You know, I thought it was a very bad statement. \nYou know, you build a fortune. You\u2019re a smart guy. You want to do something great for the country. I\u2019m giving up millions of dollars. \nI had Macy\u2019s terminate a deal because \u201cOh, Don, you\u2019re a little controversial. You\u2019re talking about illegal immigration.\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s illegal.\u201d But they had no guts. No, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. \nAnd then you have this guy, Lindsey Graham, a total lightweight. He\u2019s a guy in the private sector, he couldn\u2019t get a job. Believe me. Couldn\u2019t get a job. \nHe couldn\u2019t do what you people did. You\u2019re all retired as hell and rich. Okay? He wouldn\u2019t be rich. He\u2019d be poor. \nBut Lindsey Graham, now they say, \u201cDonald, your language is inflammatory.\u201d \nNow, I went to the Wharton School of Finance. I was a great student. I built a fortune. I\u2019ve had many bestsellers. The Art of the Deal is about the biggest selling business book of all time. Did a show that everybody said is going to fail called The Apprentice and it was a tremendous success. Tremendous. One of the most. \nBy the way, 14, 15 copies of the Apprentice \u2013 every one of them failed. And then they renewed it by the way. They thought I was going to do it. I said, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand, NBC.\u201d The head people from NBC and Comcast, they came to my office and they said \u2013 recently like a few months ago. They said, \u201cPlease, please don\u2019t run. We\u2019ve renewed The Apprentice.\u201d \nIt did great. We had a good last season even after 12 years, 14 seasons. Had a great season. \nAnd all these copies. Everybody did a copy. I won\u2019t name the names because I don\u2019t want to embarrass anybody. But you know important names. Not like Trump. But they\u2019re important. And they all failed. Most of them immediately. Most of them immediately. \nSo NBC renews The Apprentice. Everyone said, \u201cWell, I thought you were running for President.\u201d I said I am. Well, they don\u2019t understand. Well, I told them I\u2019m not doing it. They didn\u2019t believe me. Mark Burnett called me and he said, \u201cThey\u2019ve given you a major renewal.\u201d They did \u2013 28 shows. \n28 shows. That\u2019s a lot. You know how much money I give up by doing this. \nThese politicians \u2013 they run and they run and they win and sometimes they lose and they keep running. That\u2019s all they do is they run. Most of them don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. They just run. They\u2019re like \u2013 you wind them up and they run for office. \nThey don\u2019t do anything when they get there. I know them better than anybody. \nSo they say they didn\u2019t like the way that, you know, I\u2019m a little loud. I\u2019m a little too strong for them. They don\u2019t like it. \nAnd then I watch this idiot Lindsey Graham on television today and he calls me a jackass. \u201cHe\u2019s a jackass\u201d. \nYou know, I built a company. They all said I\u2019d never run. I announced that I was going to run. \u201cWell, he\u2019ll never file his form papers.\u201d That was two weeks ago. I filed my form papers. \n\u201cWell, he\u2019ll never file his financials.\u201d And my financials are like, well, it\u2019s like 98 pages. \nBy the way, a lot of these politicians haven\u2019t filed them and they\u2019re like half a page. And they still haven\u2019t filed them. I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s filed practically. \nA lot of these guys haven\u2019t filed. That was one of the things that you\u2019d have to do to get into the debates. \nSo everyone figured, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll keep Trump out of the debates because he\u2019ll never file his financials because he doesn\u2019t want to see \u2013 he doesn\u2019t want people to see that maybe he\u2019s not as wealthy as people thought.\u201d \nWell, it turned out that I\u2019m much wealthier than people thought. I built a great company. I wanted to file if for no other reason I\u2019m a private company. I can\u2019t tell you how rich you are...But who the hell knows? Nobody knows how rich I am. So now I had to file. So it\u2019s over $10 billion. Hundreds of millions of dollars. And I made $213 million filed certified on The Apprentice. Can you imagine they paid me $213 million? \nSo you know what that means when I give up The Apprentice to run to help you people straighten out this mess that everyone\u2019s created \u2013 that the politicians and Obama have created? I mean it\u2019s very expensive and it\u2019s very everything and I don\u2019t care. \nAnd what I say about the $10 billion, it\u2019s much more than that but that\u2019s okay. I want to be conservative. When I say about the $10 billion, I\u2019m not doing that to brag. Who cares? Who cares? If you have a billion, you can live very nice. I\u2019m only kidding. \nWho cares? What I\u2019m saying is that\u2019s the mindset that we need as a country. \nWe need to take back our jobs from China and other places. We need to make great deals with other countries. \nSaudi Arabia \u2013 I like the Saudis. They\u2019re very nice. I make a lot of money with them. They buy all sorts of my stuff. All kinds of toys from Trump. They pay me millions and hundreds of millions. \nBut you know what? They make $1 billion a day, folks. And whenever they\u2019re in trouble, our military takes care. You know what we get? Nothing. \nSouth Korea \u2013 crazy is right. Right? Who said that? Stand up. Stand up. He said it\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s crazy. They make $1 billion a day. \n...And by the way, Nevada just came out with a poll, and I said I will win the Hispanic vote. I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s going to win the Hispanic vote because I\u2019m going to take jobs from China, Japan, and Mexico and lots of other places, we\u2019re going to bring them back here and they\u2019re going to work. They\u2019re going to be legal in the country. They\u2019re going to work. Everybody\u2019s going to be happy and make money. \nSo I love the Mexican people. I love the Mexican people and I love Mexico. I really like Mexico. It\u2019s a great place. \nThe problem we have is that their leaders are much smarter, sharper, and more cunning than our leaders. Are you shocked to hear that, by the way? \nIs anybody not sharper and more cunning and smarter than our leaders? Any country in the world? \nDo we make any good deals any more on trade? \nWhen was the last time you said \u201cOh gee, we beat China in a trade deal\u201d? Doesn\u2019t happen. \u201cWe beat Japan in a trade deal\u201d? \n...I was in Los Angeles. I see these ships come in. Biggest ships I\u2019ve ever seen. Millions of cars coming into this country. Ships that are five times longer than this totally sold out building along with the amphitheaters by the way. \nThe press never reports that. They never report that. But that\u2019s okay. I was actually going to bring the press, have them sit over here so they see. \nBut totally \u2013 just the biggest ships. Cars, cars, cars. \nThey just cut their yen. You know, they just cut their currency. Now it\u2019s going to be even harder. \nI tell this story. A friend of mine is a great excavator. This is what he does. He digs foundations. You didn\u2019t think I know people like that. Those are my people, let me tell you. This guy\u2019s great. \nHe\u2019s a great excavator and he was very, very upset because his order for new excavation equipments and tractors. \nI said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t buy Caterpillar. All my life I\u2019ve bought Caterpillar and now I went to MatSu.\u201d \nI said, \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d He said, \u201cBecause Japan just cut their currency so low, Donald, that I had no choice. I had to do it. I feel so guilty. But I owe it to my wife and my family and my employees and the company that I built. They couldn\u2019t compete with it.\u201d \nAnd I said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that sad?\u201d \n...That\u2019s happening. It\u2019s happening even worse with China. They manipulate their currency better than any country in the history of the world in history. History. They\u2019re killing us. \nAnd if you want to do business with China, it\u2019s almost impossible because believe me they tax you. We don\u2019t tax because we have people that are stupid. \nYou know, free trade \u2013 I believe in it. I believe in it. Totally. I\u2019m a free trader. \nThe problem with free trade is you need smart people on our side. Okay? We need smart people. I could take some of the people up here. I could put them in. They\u2019d do a great job. \nBut we need smart people. And when you don\u2019t have smart people, free trade is not a good thing because it\u2019s killing us. So I believe in free trade, but we\u2019ve got to get the right people. \nNow, China loves me. Who\u2019s worse to China than I am? \nI\u2019m constantly talking about how they\u2019re ripping us off everything else. And yet, I just signed a lease with the largest bank in the world from China. They\u2019re in one of my buildings. I sell apartments for $25, $35, $45, $12, $9 million to people from China. \nI own a big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco. I beat the people from China. I win against China. \nYou can win against China if you\u2019re smart. But our people don\u2019t have a clue. \nWe give state dinners to the heads of China. I said, \u201cWhy are you doing state dinners for them? They\u2019re ripping us left and right. Just take them to McDonalds and go back to the negotiating table.\u201d Seriously. It\u2019s true. \nSo then they talk about the tone. You know, Hillary and all of them. \nAnd then I see Rick Perry the other day and he\u2019s so \u2013 you know, he\u2019s doing very poorly in the polls. He put glasses on so people will think he\u2019s smart and it just doesn\u2019t work. You know, people can see through the glasses. But he\u2019s got the glasses, the whole deal...I\u2019d say he did a lousy job on the border. \nYou know, the new governor, Gov. Abbott, has put in things that should have been put in a long time ago. \nBut I see him \u2013 he\u2019s so vicious. You know, used to be a really nice guy. He used to come to see me for contributions and support. All of a sudden, he wants to show that he\u2019s a tough guy with Trump. So tough...He was very nasty. \n...We have to make our country great again. \nAnd I made a statement and I read a speech. Actually I didn\u2019t read \u2013 I don\u2019t use teleprompters. I don\u2019t like it. They\u2019re too easy. Other people use teleprompters. Maybe when you run for President, you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use a teleprompter because you\u2019d find out what you\u2019re getting. Does that make sense? \nAnd very interestingly, made a speech, got great reviews \u2013 fantastic reviews. And everybody thought it was a wonderful speech, wonderful opening. \nThen about a week later, they said, \u201cOh\u201d. They took a statement and they dissected it and they cut out a few words and they said this. And all of a sudden. \nAnd it was very interesting. And what that sort of transformed into was the word \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d. And we brought something up that wasn\u2019t even discussed by anybody \u2013 Democrat, Republican. Wasn\u2019t discussed. \nThe problem that we\u2019re having in this country. It\u2019s a tremendous problem with the border and border security and lack of border security and illegal immigrants. It\u2019s a huge problem. \nAnd now everybody\u2019s talking about it and they\u2019re saying I was right. \nAnd people that were criticizing me two weeks ago are calling me and they\u2019re saying \u201cOff the record, Mr. Trump, you were right.\u201d \nAnd even reporters \u2013 a couple of them called \u2013 and they \u2013 I said, \u201cWould you go on the record?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no, we don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d \nBut we\u2019re getting great credit. \nAnd then last week as you know, we had a tremendous rally \u2013 15,000 people in Phoenix, Arizona \u2013 and it was unbelievable. \nAnd they came for a reason and it was illegal immigration. They\u2019re being decimated. They want it stopped. \nI want people to come into the country. But they have to do it through the legal process. \nAnd we can open up the legal process and make it go faster and all of those things. But it has to be a legal process. You can\u2019t have people just pouring into the country. \nSo I was out there and I was taking tremendous abuse. Unbelievable abuse, actually. \nAnd people said, \u201cWould you apologize? Would you apologize?\u201d \nAnd then there were tremendous crimes that were being noted after my speech. \nAnd then you had magnificent Kate [Steinle] from San Francisco killed by an illegal immigrant who was forced across the border, back to us \u2013 in my opinion, forced by the Mexican government \u2013 back to us and that was taken place and five times back into our country. And the fifth time was not good because Kate should be with us and she\u2019s not with us. She was an amazing person from everybody\u2019s standpoint and she\u2019s not with us. \nAnd then other things happened. So many other things. And now people are looking and they\u2019re seeing what\u2019s going on. \nSo that\u2019s become a very, very big topic \u2013 illegal immigration. And I can say in terms of setting the standard and setting the force, it would not even be discussed right now folks and it\u2019s going to be something I think that\u2019s going to be one of the hot buttons. \nNow, I watch as politicians are trying to claim that, and that\u2019s okay with me. You know they\u2019re all talk, no action so they won\u2019t do anything anyway. Just so you understand. They can talk all they want. \nI mean, I got a little dose of it. I was coming up and I see your Senator. What a stiff. What a stiff. Lindsey Graham. \nBy the way, he\u2019s registered zero in the polls. Zero! He\u2019s on television all the time. \nSo this morning, you know, they told me, \u201cMr. Trump\u201d, because Bush said my tone\u2019s not nice. I said, \u201cTone, we need tone. We need enthusiasm. We need tone.\u201d It\u2019s true. \nAnd actually Hillary Clinton said, \u201cI don\u2019t like his tone.\u201d \nWe have people having their heads cut off \u2013 Christians in the Middle East. We have people that are being dunked in cages and drowned in the Middle East. \nWe have border security that doesn\u2019t exist and it\u2019s not because of our incredible border folks. I mean, they can do the job. \nAnd we can build a wall. And by the way, Mexico can pay for the wall. Just so you understand. You know, all of these guys say, \u201cOh, they\u2019ll never pay.\u201d Of course they\u2019ll pay. If you have the right guy negotiating that, they\u2019ll pay. They\u2019re making a fortune. \nAnd I have a lot of respect for Mexico by the way. A lot of people say \u201cOh, he doesn\u2019t like\u201d \u2013 I love Mexico. \nAnd I love the Mexican people. I\u2019ve had thousands of Mexicans working for me. I sell apartments for millions of dollars to people from Mexico. They love me. They love me. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Springfield, Ohio", "text": "You got to get out and vote. It\u2019s going to be something special. \nAnd I tell you this and I tell others this sometimes. This is an amazing group of people. The spirit, the energy, the genius. The genius. \nBut you will say that this will be one of the great and most important meetings of your life. \nBut most importantly, you will say that this vote will be the most important vote you\u2019ve ever cast. \nBecause our country doesn\u2019t win anymore. We don\u2019t win with trade. We don\u2019t win with our great military. We don\u2019t allow them to win. We don\u2019t win with ISIS. The world is laughing at us. We don\u2019t win at the borders. We don\u2019t win with taking care of our vets. We don\u2019t win with anything. We don\u2019t win anymore. \nWe will start winning again like you\u2019ve never seen before. \nAnd I can say that one of our great two congressmen who are here some place \u2013 where are those great guys? They\u2019re here. They\u2019re going to be coming to see me at the White House. And they\u2019re going to say, \u201cMr. President. Mr. President, sir, Mr. President, the people of Ohio, they can\u2019t take it anymore, sir. You\u2019re winning too much. You knocked out ISIS. There are too many jobs in Ohio. Too many companies are pouring in. We have a little traffic.\u201d \nTraffic wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing. Right? Every time you see traffic, remember, it\u2019s not such a bad thing. \n\u201cMr. President, you\u2019re winning too much. Please, please stop winning so much. We\u2019re not used to it.\u201d \nI\u2019d say, \u201cListen, congressmen, we are going to continue to win. We are going to win like never before.\u201d \nWe are going to make our country wealthy again. We are going to make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. \nThank you very much. Thank you everybody. Make sure you go out and vote. \nIt\u2019s ISIS all over the place. You know, she said she\u2019ll stop ISIS. \nLet me tell ya, there was no ISIS. There was no ISIS. \nDuring her term, she created with Obama a vacuum in Iraq. ISIS formed, and then Obama called them the JV, junior varsity, right? Well, they\u2019re not the JV anymore, folks. \nThey\u2019re gonna be no trouble. We are going to knock them so hard. But look, look, they\u2019re not the JV and they weren\u2019t then. And now, they\u2019re in 32 different countries. So she\u2019s saying we will get rid of ISIS. \nShe wants to go back home and go to sleep, that\u2019s what she wants to do. \nDid you see where she got upset yesterday because I took a little while, just a few hours, to cut a ribbon to make sure my kids did a good job? \nWe built the building, by the way, under budget and ahead of schedule. \nAnd she said, \u201cDonald Trump got off the campaign trail.\u201d I mean, I\u2019ve been doing 6, 7, 8 things a day every single day. \nShe\u2019s home sleeping half the time. I say, she\u2019s definitely a low-energy person. I said, \u201cWhere is Hillary?\u201d \nI watched after the last debate and after the second debate, she was tired. Wow. She walked off that stage pushing a lot of people around. They had a lot of people around her, which was fun. \nEverything will change in November. \nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days. \nWe\u2019re going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. \nWe\u2019re going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. \nWe\u2019re going to provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. \nWe\u2019re going to rebuild our military and take care of our vets. \nWe will support the truly great men and women of law enforcement. \nWe are going to save our Second Amendment, which is under siege. \nAnd we\u2019ll appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court, so important, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \nAmericans are tired of being told by politicians they have to defer they\u2019re dreams to another day, but they really mean another decade. \nIt\u2019s like our politics are caught in time loop. We keep electing the same people over and over again. Clinton, Clinton, oh, Clinton. The impeachment, the lying, the whole thing. \nWe\u2019re going to keep making the same mistakes if you keep doing that. And we are going to continue to hear the same old excuses. \nThese career politicians keep telling us that things can change. That we can find new solutions. That\u2019s basically what they tell us. \nWell, I have a message for them. The future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics and not the critics. \nI\u2019m asking all Americans to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future. \nI\u2019m going to fight for every American of every background in every stretch of this nation. \nI\u2019m going to fight to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty and crime and fear. \nAnd I\u2019m going to fight for the inner cities and for the African-American community. And the way they\u2019re forced to live in the inner cities with no jobs, no education, and no safety. \nI\u2019m going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. \nI\u2019m going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. \nJust imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together again as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag. \nIt\u2019s right. Once again we will have a government of, by, and for the people. \nAt least they should be nice to us. They\u2019re not even nice. They\u2019ll be nice. \nThousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants. \nRight here in Ohio, 60-year-old old Margaret Kostelnik was murdered in cold blood by an illegal immigrant. Earlier that day, her killer shot another woman in the arm while she was with her children in a nearby park. Police encountered the man more than three weeks before the crime scene, but federal authorities refused to take him into custody, even though people were saying, \u201cPlease, please don\u2019t let him out. Please take him in.\u201d \nThen there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, a Minnesota farmer who was brutally beaten by illegal immigrants and left to bleed to death in his home. Earl\u2019s body was found with his hands bound behind his back in duct tape. A blunt force injury to his head. His killers had criminal records but they did not meet the Obama administration\u2019s priorities for removal. But others that knew him and others that knew them were pleading, were pleading, \u201cDon\u2019t let them out. Don\u2019t let them into our society.\u201d \nI have a message for the cartels, the drug dealers, and the gang members. When I win, your long reign of crime and terror and horror will come to a very beautiful crashing end. \nWe will also repeal Obama-Clinton defense cuts and rebuild our badly depleted military. \nOur Air Force is the smallest and oldest it\u2019s ever been. Did you know that? Because I know what you have here. \nYou guys are good with Wright Patterson. Right? What a great place. \nBut we\u2019re very depleted. We have old equipment. We will build brand new, modern, state of the art planes to fly right at \u2019em, right at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. \nWe have a lot of veterans here today. I want to thank them for their service, and let them know as president I have your back. Believe me. \nI have your back. We will. \nShe just said, \u201cMake America great again, Mr. Trump.\u201d \nWe will make America great again. Don\u2019t worry about it. We will. And it won\u2019t take too long. \nWe will change our foreign policy. \nHillary Clinton\u2019s policies in Iraq, Syria, Libya threw the Middle East into total turmoil. We\u2019re spending $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East while our own country falls into total disrepair. \nNow Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria, conflict with a nuclear power \u2013 Russia \u2013 which could very well lead to World War III. \nAnd the way she talks about Putin. She\u2019s always said she has no idea, but she\u2019s always saying \u2014 WikiLeaks, it\u2019s Russia and Donald Trump \u2014 I have nothing to do with Russia. \nShe said maybe Donald Trump is involved in projects with the Russians. The answer\u2019s no, no. \nBut what she does, she says Donald Trump and Russia. \nLook, look, she speaks so badly of Putin, nuclear country, she speaks so badly, I say \u2014 and she uses it to try and get votes. \nI said to myself you know, how do you speak so badly of somebody, I mean how are they going to ever get along? Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we actually got along with Russia and other countries? \nAnd we together went after ISIS and knocked the hell out of them? Wouldn\u2019t that be a good thing? Because they want to get them out also. \nBut she speaks very badly of Putin, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s smart, you know. \nYou can be very tough, but you shouldn\u2019t be doing what she\u2019s doing. \nAs her own team has said in WikiLeaks, she has terrible instincts. \nTo all Americans I say it\u2019s time for new leadership, it really is time. It really is. \nCan you imagine four more years of Obama? That\u2019s what you got to \u2014 \nIt\u2019s high taxes. It\u2019s high regulations, all these companies they can\u2019t even breathe with the regulations. Unnecessary. \nBut to be a rich country, we also must be a safe country. \nHillary Clinton released ISIS into the world. You know that story. And spreading violently and spreading now into the United States. \nThere are now 1,000 open ISIS investigations in the United States. \nISIS is on a campaign for a genocide of Christians in the Middle East or what they call the Nation of the Cross. Okay? The Nation of the Cross. \nThey are crucifying, drowning and beheading their victims. This is something we would read about in history books, and not since medieval times have you heard about the beheading and all the things that are happening. \nSo we have no choice. We will stop ISIS and we stop them fast. \nAnd unlike what they\u2019ve done in Mosul, which is turning out to be very difficult, we\u2019re not giving three and four months notice. We\u2019re coming in. We\u2019re coming in. \nYou think General George Patton would say \u201cWe are coming in 3 or 4 months. Get ready\u201d? What a bunch. \nThey\u2019re throwing people off buildings, hanging their victims from meat hooks. They\u2019re hanging their victims from meat hooks.  \nThe New York Post just published reports about ISIS crushing children to death and burning adults alive. \nNow Hillary wants massive immigration from the most dangerous region of the world, where ISIS operates, including a 550% increase in Syrian refugees over and above the thousands and thousands that President Obama has taken. \nWe don\u2019t want ISIS in our country. \nThe Hillary refugee plan would leave us generations of terrorism, radicalism, and extremism inside of our shores. \nI only want to admit people who will support this country and love its people. So important. \nKeeping our families safe is the highest obligation of the president of the United States. \nA Trump administration is going to suspend immigration from terror prone region, and we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. That was easy. \nWe\u2019re not going to take the risk when it comes to the safety of the American people, no longer. \nSo let me state this as easy as I can. If I am elected president, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. \nHillary also said she wants totally open borders. No one who supports open borders can ever serve as president of the United States. Totally open borders.  \nA Trump administration will also secure, defend the borders of the United States. \nAnd yes, we will build a wall. After. We have to. \nAnd who is going to pay for the wall? 100%. Mexico, in terms of our trade deficits, is making a fortune off the United Sates. Their leaders who are doing a much smarter job. \nBut you know what? We\u2019ll be happy with Mexico, and Mexico is going to be wonderful, and we\u2019re going to have a great relationship with Mexico, with China, and with other. \nWe don\u2019t have even have good relationships right now. They rip us off and we still don\u2019t get along. \nAt the core of my contract is my economic plan. That plan can be summarized in three very beautiful words, especially for the people in this area and this room \u2013 jobs, jobs, jobs. \nNo, it\u2019s terrible what\u2019s happened in this area. What\u2019s happened to this country with jobs is terrible. \nHillary Clinton promised to bring upstate New York 200,000 jobs when she ran for Senate. Instead, the jobs left. They didn\u2019t come in. They left. \nShe\u2019s been there for 30 years and hasn\u2019t fixed anything. She\u2019s just made things worse except for herself and her husband. \n47 million Americans are on food stamps and 45 million Americans live in poverty. \nNearly 1 in 4 Americans in their prime earning years are not working or able to work. \n70 million American women and children are in poverty or in the brink of poverty, and nearly half of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in abject poverty. \nOur national debt has doubled in eight years, and our infrastructure throughout our country is crumbling. Bad shape. Our airports, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools, our hospitals. \nOur trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year. \nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Think of it. And that\u2019s so true. It\u2019s the single greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. What our politicians have allowed to happen to this area but to all areas of our country \u2013 NAFTA, TPP they want to approve. A disaster. \nOhio has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary Clinton. \nRemember, every time you see a closed factory or a wiped out community in Ohio, it was essentially caused by the Clintons. It was NAFTA. It was caused by the Clintons. \nWhy a deal like that was allowed. We\u2019ve lost 70,000 factories. Think of that one. 70,000. I tell everybody \u2013 it\u2019s a typo. Can\u2019t be 70,000. It is. \nWe\u2019ve lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary backed disaster. \nJust this year, Eaton Corporation in Ohio closed its plant, laid off 152 workers and moved their jobs to Mexico. And you\u2019ve had many and I could name them all day long. \nUnder my contract, if a company wants to fire their workers, move to Mexico or other countries, and ship their products back into the United States, we will put a 35% tariffs on those products. \nAnd folks, just in case you have any questions, when that happens you\u2019re not losing your companies anymore. And if you do, at least the country\u2019s going to make a lot of money. Okay? \nWe will immediately begin renegotiating NAFTA. And if we don\u2019t get the deal we want, right now it\u2019s a one-way highway, we lose our jobs. We lose our company. We lose our cash. \nI\u2019d say they get the cash. They get the jobs. They get the companies. We get the drugs. We get the unemployment. That\u2019s what we get. We get nothing. We get less than nothing. \nWe will terminate and get a much better deal for our workers if we can\u2019t renegotiate it properly. We\u2019re going to get a better deal for our workers and for our companies because we cannot continue to be the people led by stupid people. We can\u2019t. We can\u2019t. \nAs part of our plan to bring back American jobs, we will lower taxes on our businesses from 35% down to 15%. \nWe will also cut taxes for middle class families by 35% and massively simplify taxes for all Americans. \nWe will be a rich nation once again. \nHere in Ohio, another five insurance companies are dropping out of Obamacare. Good luck, good luck in negotiations, folks. \nThat means that all the residents covered by plans from these companies will be getting cancellation notices very soon. \nObamacare is really \u2014 and you know this \u2014 a catastrophe, it\u2019s a catastrophic event for Ohio workers and is making it impossible for many parents to pay their bills, support their families, or get quality medical care to their children. \nRepealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November eighth. \nHave to win. \nReal change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington, D.C. \nHillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 phone calls. I mean 13, 13 phones, made them disappear, sometimes with a hammer. Right? Wrong, wrong. Let\u2019s get rid of these... And then told the FBI she could remember 39 different times. \nThe Clinton crew gave more than $675,000 to the wife of the Deputy Director of the FBI, and the man who was overseeing the investigation into Hillary\u2019s illegal server, a server we now know Obama knew about. Just found that out yesterday. WikiLeaks. \nThe more e-mails WikiLeaks releases, the more lines between the Clinton Foundation, the Secretary of State\u2019s office, and the Clintons\u2019 personal finances, they all get blurred. \nJust today we read about Clinton confidante Doug Brand bragging that he had funneled tens of millions of dollars to Bill Clinton, Inc., through the Foundation donations, paid speeches, and consulting contracts. \nMr. Band called the arrangement unorthodox. The rest of us call it outright corrupt. \nIn fact, the Clinton Foundation even hired a law firm to find out if their pay to play scheme would jeopardize their charitable status with the IRS. \nIf the Clintons were willing to play this fast and loose with their enterprise when they weren\u2019t in the White House, just imagine what they\u2019ll do given the chance to once again control the Oval Office. \nAnd we\u2019ve had enough. Honestly, I think we\u2019ve had enough of the Clintons, in all fairness. Right? Don\u2019t you agree? \nHad enough. I mean at what point, at what point do we say it? \nHillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency. \nI proposed a contract with the American voter that will end the corruption and give the government back to the people. \nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words I\u2019m about to say. \nIf we win on Nov, 8th, when... Okay. Okay. When we win on Nov. 8th. \nWe don\u2019t want to take it for granted, but we are winning in a lot of states, I have to say. \nThe media now, they\u2019re going wild. The media\u2019s going wild. Because they\u2019re saying, you know, this guy\u2019s winning in Florida, he\u2019s winning in North Carolina, he\u2019s winning in Iowa, he\u2019s winning in Ohio. \nAll right. When we win, right, we are going to Washington, D.C., and we are going to drain the swamp. \nA lot of spirit in this room \u2014 it\u2019s a good one. \nThat includes a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. \nUnbelievable. \nPeople don\u2019t know, I worked in Ohio, did you know that? And I had a great experience. \nAnd if I didn\u2019t have a great experience starting out when I was very young, maybe I wouldn\u2019t be here right now, who knows? You need that. It was great for confidence also. \nIn 12 days, we\u2019re going to win Ohio, and we are going to win back the White House. \nA brand new poll from Remington Research \u2014 highly respected \u2014 has just a few minutes ago come out, and in Ohio we are right now, four points up. \nEarly voting is underway, so make sure, get out and vote, we don\u2019t wanna \u2014 we don\u2019t wanna give this away. \nYou know, we have a movement going on like they\u2019ve never seen before in this country. \nDrain the swamps. You\u2019ve got a \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d sign back there. We\u2019re going to drain the swamp, believe me. \nBut this is a movement like they\u2019ve never seen in this country before, and every place is packed, and the greatest people on Earth, and we\u2019re going to turn our country around. We\u2019re turning it around fast. \n75% of the people think our country is headed in the wrong direction. We know it\u2019s headed in the wrong direction. We\u2019re going to fix it. We\u2019re going to take our country back, and it\u2019s going to be put very quickly on the right track. \nReal change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. \nIt\u2019s just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare. You see that. \nIncluding premiums like in the great state of Arizona, where they\u2019re going to go up at 116%. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be there very soon, unless I win in which case you\u2019re not going to have to worry about it. \nEven Bill Clinton admitted that Obamacare is quote, \u201cThe craziest thing in the world, where people wind up paying their premiums which double, and their coverage is cut in half.\u201d \nJob killing...Job killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged. \nRemember the name Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare? \nHe said they could pass Obamacare \u2014 when he didn\u2019t know he was being recorded \u2014 he said they could pass Obamacare, because the stupidity of the American voter will allow it to take place. \nThe only stupidity was that incredible stupidity shown by our politicians when they forced this bill through over the furious objection to many politicians, in all fairness, many, many politicians, but really the American people. And it was very, very sad. \nAnd in all fairness to the Democrats, had our president not lied 28 times \u2014 remember, you can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor, it passed by this much \u2014 they would not have gone for it. But they believed him too, like everybody else believed him. \nThey\u2019ve caught them in a lot of lies lately, folks. \nHillary Clinton, talking about liars, wants to double down \u2013 Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare and make it even worse. \nSo, here, I\u2019m going to repeal it, replace it. We\u2019re going to have a replacement that is so much less expensive and so much better. \nYou don\u2019t even get to use Obamacare because the deductible is so high and, you know, it\u2019s just... \nLook, it is so \u2014 it is so out of control, you\u2019ll never get to use it. $4,000, $5,000 before you can start taking... \nJust this and just happened, Hillary Clinton declared that Obamacare \u2014 do you remember this \u2014 not so long ago \u2013 as one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our county. It\u2019s a total disaster. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks on deporting illegal immigrants at the CNN Republican presidential debate", "text": "First of all, I want to build a wall \u2013 a wall that works. So important and it\u2019s a big part part of it. \nSecond of all, we have a lot of really bad dudes in this country from outside and I think Chris knows that maybe as well as anybody. \nThey go, if I get elected, first day they\u2019re gone. Gangs all over the place. Chicago, Baltimore, no matter where you live. \nWe have a country based on laws. I will make sure those laws are adhered to. \nThese are illegal immigrants. \nI don\u2019t think you\u2019d even be asking this question if I didn\u2019t run. Because when I ran and I brought this up at my opening marks at Trump Tower, I took heat like nobody has taken heat in a long time. \nAnd then they found out with the killing of Kate from San Francisco and so many other crimes, they found that I was right. And most people, many people apologized to me. \nI don\u2019t think you\u2019d even be talking about illegal immigration if it weren\u2019t for me. \nSo, we have a country of laws. They\u2019re going to go out and they\u2019ll come back if they deserve to come back. \nIf they\u2019ve had a bad record, if they\u2019ve been arrested, if they\u2019ve been in jail, they\u2019re never coming back. \nWe\u2019re going to have a country again. Right now we don\u2019t have a country, we don\u2019t have a border, and we\u2019re going to do something about it and it can be done with proper management and it can be done with heart. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "text": "We\u2019re going to have a strong border. We\u2019re going to have a real border. We\u2019re going to have a wall. Mexico is paying for it. We\u2019re going to have a wall. \nAnd we\u2019re going to stop bad, bad things from happening in this country. Because if you look at what\u2019s going on and you look at the tremendous crime and you look at the drugs that are pouring across the border, it\u2019s \u2013 the drugs are pouring like water. They\u2019re pouring across. \nYou know when I won \u2013 New Hampshire is a special place to me because they were the first victory I had. And I won New Hampshire, and I wasn\u2019t expected to win it; Jeb was expected to win it. And I won it in landslide. \nAnd I\u2019d go around and I\u2019d see the people of New Hampshire, and they tell me, \u201cMr. Trump, our biggest problem is heroin.\u201d I said, \u201cHeroin?\u201d It doesn\u2019t make sense. You know, you look at the beautiful trees or the woods or the roadways and the lakes. I said, \u201cHeroin?\u201d It just doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s incongruous. Right? It doesn\u2019t work. But it was heroin. And I said, \u201cIf I get in, we\u2019re going to stop that problem.\u201d Then I said, \u201cWhere does it come from?\u201d They said, \u201cIt comes from the southern border. They come right in.\u201d \nNow, New Hampshire rated it their number one problem. They have a tremendous problem. But many other communities, including you, but many other communities have this problem. We\u2019re going to stop it cold, folks. We\u2019re going to stop it cold. \nAnd the bottom line is this. Look, we have a big, big day. And you\u2019re going to look back on this evening and you\u2019re going to say that was one of the great evenings of your life because we love the country. We love the country. \n...I love you too. Thank you. \nReally do. I love the people. I love the people. \nYou know, they say Donald Trump \u2013 my base is so strong. They say, \u201cDonald Trump can do almost anything.\u201d In fact, one person today said \u201cAnything\u201d. \nAnd they interviewed a woman, I saw her last night on television sitting in a hotel room, which was not the most beautiful room I\u2019ve ever been. It was very clean, and I only want clean. I don\u2019t care about the room. I want clean. \nBut they were sitting there and they said to a woman \u2013 a wonderful woman, probably 55 years old, and her friends were there. And they said, \u201cWhat would it take to get you to vote for somebody other than Donald Trump?\u201d She said, \u201cDon\u2019t play that game. There\u2019s nothing he can do that would get me to vote against him.\u201d And I wanted to go up and I wanted to hug that television set. \nI wanted to \u2013 I wish I could find out who she is. But we have so many people like that. We\u2019re all like that. I mean, a big chunk of the country is like that because we\u2019re tired of stupidity. We\u2019re tired of seeing what\u2019s happening to our great country. \nSo, here\u2019s the deal. You\u2019re going to go home and you\u2019re going to remember this. \nBut much more importantly, tomorrow, you get everybody you can and I promise you. You\u2019re going to be so proud of your country. You\u2019re going to go out and vote. You\u2019re going to be so proud of your president. But forget that. You\u2019re going to be so proud of this country again. \nAnd you\u2019re going to remember the evening because we\u2019re going to start winning again. We\u2019re going to win on trade. We\u2019re going to win with our military. We\u2019re going to knock out the ISIS. \nWe\u2019re going to win. We are going to win with the military. We\u2019re going to knock out ISIS. We\u2019re going to knock them out. \nWe\u2019re going to win for our vets because our vets have been treated too badly. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore. \nWe\u2019re going to win at the border. We\u2019re going to win with education. \nWe\u2019re going to win with our Second Amendment. So many people talk to me about the Second Amendment. \nWe\u2019re going to win at every single element of what we\u2019re doing. And every single thing we\u2019re going to win, win, win. \nAnd you\u2019re going to say, \u201cThat was the single greatest vote that I have ever cast\u201d, and you\u2019re going to look back and you\u2019re going to be proud of yourselves and you\u2019re going to be proud of your country again. \nSo thank you very much everybody. This is a great, great honor. Thank you! \nGet out and vote! I love you all! Thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you! \nCan you imagine? She was Person of the Year. \nI was supposed to be Person of the Year on Time Magazine. She beat me out and she destroyed Germany. Can you believe this? \nThat\u2019s not good. I wonder if Time Magazine had that one to do over again what they\u2019d say. I think we\u2019ll be in much better shape. Well, they\u2019ve treated me nice. I\u2019ve been on the cover a lot. \nAnd the reason we\u2019re on the cover a lot is because we have a movement the likes of which people have never seen. \nSo here\u2019s the story. Here\u2019s the story. \nYou know, one of the great writers called me up and he said, \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done is incredible.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, no, I have to win.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no, it makes no difference. If you win, if you lose, it doesn\u2019t matter. What you\u2019ve done is down in the history books. You will be cover for all time. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, sir. No, sir. I have to win. Because if I don\u2019t win, to me, I will consider it a tremendous waste of time and waste of money but a tremendous waste of time.\u201d \nSo here\u2019s the story. Here\u2019s the story. We\u2019re going to take care of our Second Amendment. It\u2019s being chipped and chipped. \nWe\u2019re going to get rid of Common Core. We\u2019re going to bring education back locally. \nWe\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is a total catastrophe. You\u2019re going to have great health insurance. \nWe\u2019re going to save your Social Security. We\u2019re going to save your Medicare. We are going to save it because we are going to make our country rich again. We\u2019re going to bring back our jobs. We\u2019re not going to let our jobs go. And we\u2019re going to be able to afford \u2013 you\u2019ve been paying in it a long time and a lot of these guys want it to be knocked to hell. It\u2019s not going to happen. Okay? Remember that. It\u2019s not going to happen. \nWe\u2019re going to start winning again, folks. We don\u2019t win anymore. We don\u2019t win anymore. We don\u2019t win with our military. We can\u2019t beat ISIS. We\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to knock the hell out of ISIS. \nWe don\u2019t win with our vets. Our vets are being treated worse than illegal immigrants. Our vets are being treated so unfairly. They\u2019re our great people. \nAnd other people \u2013 you know, vets have endorsed me virtually unanimously and a lot of the vets will come up to me and say, \u201cYou know, Mr. Trump, we follow closely what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re the only person that ever mentions the vets.\u201d Right? \nAnd Hillary Clinton recently said about the vets that they\u2019re being taken care of just fine. They\u2019re not being take care of fine. They\u2019re not being taken care of. She said they\u2019re being taken care of just fine. \nI know the vets. Nobody\u2019s spent more time with the vets that are running. And we\u2019re going to take care of our vets. Okay? \nWe are going to tear up and make great and very lucrative and everybody is going to be happy, including the other side, trade deals. \nI have the greatest people in the world for dealing. \nWe use political hacks that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re dealing against the smartest people in China, the smartest people in Japan, the smartest people from all over the world, and our negotiators are political hacks and we\u2019re not using them anymore. \nWe\u2019re using the greatest business people in the world and we have them in this country and they\u2019re endorsing me, and I know the best ones from the not so great ones. And we\u2019re going to have great, great trade deals. \nThen they write me a letter, which I posted, asking me for $1 million. I said very nicely \u2013 I\u2019m not a bad person \u2013 I said nicely \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d I mean, you can be rich but you don\u2019t have to be stupid. Okay? Why am I going to give them $1 million? \nSo, what happens is all of a sudden I see their name all over the place \u2013 \u201cClub for Growth\u201d and they talk about, you know, different things \u2013 ridiculous things. I mean, they\u2019re the worst ads. \nAnd by the way, once was a fraudulent ad because they said, \u201cIf Cruz and Kasich got together and you added the delegates\u201d \u2013 and they showed the delegates. Right? And you add them up \u2013 and I\u2019m over here with a lot. And they said \u2013 and they add them up and they show a graph that goes much higher than mine and it\u2019s much lower than mine. \nThey\u2019re a fraud. And what we did is we told them to stop that ad and that was a week ago. And we tweeted about it. And everybody\u2019s talking about it. And I see it last night again. \nThey\u2019re crooked. So here\u2019s what they do. It\u2019s like a form of extortion, I guess. Right? When you think of it. They come to your office. They ask for $1 million. You don\u2019t give them $1 million. They go out. They do negative ads. \nThese are the people \u2013 you know, if these people about Trump \u2013 they call it like \u201cNo Trump\u201d. What do they call that thing? They call it \u201cNever Trump\u201d. Oh, you need Trump so badly though. \nI was saying if they would work, if they would have worked so hard, so diligently against President Barack Hussein Obama, they would have beaten him. They would have had great budgets. They would have had everything they wanted. \nBut with him...I always say, \u201cObama is the worst negotiator I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d You look at the \u2013 no, except with the Republicans. He gets everything he wants. \nI mean, you look at the omnibus budget from three months he got everything he wanted \u2013 fund Obamacare, bring people into the country that shouldn\u2019t be here. He got everything he wanted. \nSo he is the worst negotiator worldwide. \nWe have Sergeant [Bowe] Bergdahl. Right? We get Bergdahl, a traitor. No, no, think of it. This is a negotiation. We get Bergdahl. And they get \u2013 what do they get? Five of their most coveted killers that have been in jail for eight years in Gitmo, which we\u2019re not closing down by the way. Okay? We\u2019re going to run it. \nSo we get Bergdahl, a traitor, who five or six \u2013 probably six \u2013 people were killed going out to try and get him back. He left. He\u2019s a traitor. \nSo we get Bergdahl, and that\u2019s what we get. And they get five people that are right now back on the battlefield or soon to be back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody in sight, including us. Okay? \nWe\u2019ve got to stop it. We\u2019ve got to stop it. \nSo with Japan, I said they got to \u2013 maybe we\u2019ve got to walk. And the next day the headlines \u2013 \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t want to defend Japan\u201d, \u201cTrump wants Japan to get their nukes\u201d. \nOkay, here\u2019s the story, folks. You have Japan. Japan is very concerned with North Korea. \nYou know, number one, I like the way it is now but I want them to pay a lot more money. They probably will. But if they don\u2019t, it\u2019s not so bad if they are at heads. Maybe we\u2019re not supposed to get into that fight. That\u2019s a bad fight. Maybe we\u2019re not supposed to. Okay? Okay? \nSame thing with South Korea. I mean, every time he raises his head and he starts talking, every single time he raises his head, our ships start floating over, our planes start going over. We do all sorts of exercise. What are we get out of this? We have 28,000 soldiers on the line. \nSo, we have to be taken care of. \nNow, I\u2019m talking as a person financially. Okay? I\u2019m also talking militarily. But I\u2019m talking financially. \nWe don\u2019t have a country that can do this anymore. \nSaudi Arabia, until the oil went down and now they\u2019re still making a fortune. But Saudi Arabia was making $1 billion a day. We protect Saudi Arabia. If we weren\u2019t there, Saudi Arabia wouldn\u2019t be there. If Saudi Arabia didn\u2019t have us for years protecting them, they would have been gone a long time ago as Saudi Arabia. Somebody else would have it, probably maybe Iraq because he would have come back. \nAnd by the way, speaking of that, you know, I was against going into Iraq. Everyone says, \u201cOh, Trump is going to be very tough.\u201d I was against going into Iraq from the very beginning, from the very beginning. \nAnd I\u2019m going to build our military bigger, stronger than ever before. But you know what? Hopefully, we never have to use it. Nobody\u2019s going to tell us what to do though. We have to shape it up because our military is totally depleted. \nBut if our politicians would have gone to the beach for the last number of years, many years, we would be much stronger in a sense. We\u2019d be much stronger because the Middle East is a disaster. You see the great migration. It\u2019s a catastrophe. \nYou see what\u2019s going on in Germany. It\u2019s a total mess. What she has done. \nIt\u2019s like, well, how does this all happen? Okay? How does it happen? \nHere\u2019s the story, folks. \nWe\u2019re going to change our thinking. We\u2019re going to be the smart people again. We\u2019re going to be so smart. We\u2019re going to be so sharp. \nSo a lot of people don\u2019t know we protect Japan. Do you know that? Does anybody know? You might know...We protect Japan. We protect Germany. We protect South Korea. \nWhen you want a television set, who do you get it from? South Korea. Samsung. LG. You get it from South Korea. \nSo we protect all and big ships they make. These are monster, monster economies. We protect them. \nThey don\u2019t pay what they should be paying for not having to have this massive military apparatus that we supply. \nAnd you know what? We get that because we have people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing in Washington for many years. I mean, I\u2019m not even blaming it \u2013 Obama\u2019s the worst. He\u2019s the worst. The worst. \nI mean, when he just realizes, I mean he just realized that the Iran deal is a bad deal. It just took him \u2013 realize \u2013 I said, \u201cOh, why didn\u2019t you listen to me two years ago?\u201d Just two years ago if he would have listened \u2013 can you imagine? Did you ever see a deal take so long? \nBy the way, usually when a deal takes that long, it\u2019s bad automatically. I can usually tell you that. \nBut anyway, so we protect Japan. So it comes out...I said, look, I would have to tell Japan and I\u2019m talking about other nations also because I have great friends from Japan, I have great friends from South Korea. We have to go see them, go to talk to, have a meeting with them, \u201cWe love protecting you.\u201d We don\u2019t want them to arm necessarily. But you know, at some point, how long are we going to do this? \nSo we have to see them and we have to say, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to help us out.\u201d \nYou know, we have this massive, massive amount of money that we have to get rid of because we\u2019re sitting on one of the worst bubbles you\u2019ll ever see. Okay? Believe me. We\u2019ve got to straighten it out. \nWe\u2019ve got to straighten out our trade deals. We\u2019ve got to straighten out our military deals. We\u2019re taking care of all these countries. \nSo we go to Japan. And here\u2019s what the...I was telling the people and they said \u201cWow, that sounds good.\u201d We\u2019ve got to take \u2013 you\u2019ve got to take care of us. \nNow, they\u2019ll probably say initially \u201cNo\u201d. And then we leave and then they\u2019re going to say, \u201cYes.\u201d \nBut if they don\u2019t say yes, you always have to be prepared to make a great deal to walk. You have to be... \nThe problem with the Iran deal was that Secretary Kerry was like an amateur. Call him amateur night. He refused to walk. They were laughing at him in the streets of Iran. They were claiming the deal was the greatest deal ever made before it was even made. They were saying \u201cThis deal is unbelievable.\u201d They were laughing at the Secretary of State of this country. They were laughing at the United States saying that this deal is great. And they were dancing. Remember? Burning the flag dancing? \nWhen they start dancing about a deal that I\u2019m making, when they start burning the American flag, I\u2019m out of there. Bye bye. Good luck. \nAnd he just kept going back. \nAnd I kept waiting. I wanted to call him. I wanted to call him. I wanted to say, \u201cWalk.\u201d Because every single thing \u2013 he\u2019d say, \u201cWe would like to get this.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cOh, okay. You\u2019ve got it. We would like to get that.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d \nYou know, the Persians are great negotiators. It\u2019s an unbelievable deal. \nBut just yesterday, Obama just yesterday he brought it up that he\u2019s very unhappy. \nI mean, think of it. Think of it. $150 billion. It\u2019s the worst deal. We didn\u2019t get our prisoners back. We should have had the prisoners back before we started negotiating. Increase the sanctions. Don\u2019t sit at the table. Say \u201cYou give our prisoners back or we\u2019re not starting.\u201d You leave. They\u2019ll say \u201cNo\u201d. You leave. And what happens? You double up the sanctions. Within 24 hours, they call you and they say, \u201cYou\u2019ve got your prisoners.\u201d That could have been years ago. Right? \nSo we have people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. \nHere\u2019s the story. You need Trump. You do. You need Trump. You bet...You do. I mean, you\u2019ve got to have Trump. \nI mean, it\u2019s sort of interesting because I see when I turn on the television, I see these ads about myself by crooked people. \nI see these ads and they\u2019re mostly wrong. A little bit sometimes are right but they\u2019re all negative. You know. And I\u2019m looking, I\u2019m watching this on television \u2013 ad after ad. \nIn Florida, they spent $38 million on negative ads and I won it in a landslide...Does anybody read? Does anybody watch television? You know, it\u2019s not much for the advertising community when you think they spent $38 million \u2013 a record number in Florida. \nThey spent thousands and thousands of ads nationwide \u2013 listen to this one \u2013 55,000 negative ads on me. Most of them was made up. \nI\u2019ll give you one good example. \nWe have the Club for Growth, which is forget them. These are among the dumbest people that you\u2019ll ever meet. \nThey come to my office. They want me to give them $1 million. \nA friend asked me, \u201cPlease see them.\u201d I said, \u201cWho are they?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re Club for Growth.\u201d Whatever that means. \nSo they come to my office. They asked me for $1 million. I say, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d And that\u2019s it. \nAnd I\u2019m a free trader. And they say, \u201cHe\u2019s not a \u2013 \u201c Remember Jeb Bush? \u201cHe is not a conservative.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d I am a conservative. But you know what? I believe in free trade. \nBut when you have free trade, you need smart people running your side of the free trade. \nIf you don\u2019t have smart people or if you have people like Ted Cruz that are totally controlled by the people that give him the money and they\u2019re controlled by the establishment. I mean, look at the establishment. \nThis guy in his whole life didn\u2019t know what the word establishment meant. Now you have all these people going because they said, \u201cOh man, Trump is terrible. He doesn\u2019t want any of our money.\u201d \nI had one friend that came into my office \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever said this before. He came into my office. He wanted to give me millions of dollars. I said, \u201cI can\u2019t take your money. I don\u2019t want your money. I\u2019m self-funding.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no, no, you\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d He didn\u2019t even know. He thought I was kidding. He wanted to endorse me, wanted to support me. I said no, no, I don\u2019t want. Anyway, he was finally convinced that I didn\u2019t want his money and he\u2019s leaving. And I said, \u201cBy the way, what are you going to do now?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m going to give it to another candidate.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d \nThey\u2019re gamblers. They have to do it. It\u2019s like almost a disease. They have to do it. It\u2019s the craziest thing. \nHe loves me. He wants to give give me probably close to $10 million. Right? I would have had the greatest Super PAC in the history if I would have taken all the money. \nAnd my whole life, you know, I\u2019ve said this before, my whole life as a business person is this. Right? It\u2019s okay. Nothing wrong with it. I take. I keep taking. I take and take. \nBut now I\u2019m going to take for the United States. We\u2019re going to take. We\u2019re not going to be the stupid people anymore. We\u2019re not going to be the stupid people anymore. We can\u2019t be. We can\u2019t be. \nAnd with NATO when they don\u2019t pay, you know, I said \u2013 I was asked a question by Wolf Blitzer, a very fair question about NATO. \nNow, you know, I\u2019ve been a businessman. World class. I filed my business papers. They were phenomenal. Everybody says great, great, great. I built a great company. Very little debt. Tremendous cash flow. Some of the greatest assets in the world. \nAnd I tell you that only for one reason \u2013 that\u2019s the thinking we need in Washington. We need some of that thinking. \nAnd Wolf Blitzer asked me a question on television. He said, \u201cLet me just ask you about NATO.\u201d Now, I haven\u2019t been asked about NATO a lot but I understand NATO and I understand common sense, and I\u2019m like a smart person like many of the people in this room. Hopefully all of the people in this room. \nBut he asked me about NATO. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s obsolete.\u201d This was my first thing. \nAnd you know what? I\u2019m the first one. \nGuys that study NATO and good people but they study NATO and they say, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. What he just said, I never thought of it.\u201d They study it because they\u2019re so into it that they don\u2019t realize because it was really put there. \nYou had the Soviet Union and now you have Russia, which is different but Russia is powerful so we could sort of say that\u2019s a balance. So we\u2019ll leave it. \nBut it doesn\u2019t really cover terrorism like it\u2019s supposed to. Doesn\u2019t have the right countries. I mean, many of the countries and there aren\u2019t \u2013 that you associate with terrorism. \nAnd so I said number one, it\u2019s obsolete. \nI said number two, to the best of my knowledge, the United States pay far too much proportionately and why are we always paying the bills to protect other people? \nAnd the press, which is so totally dishonest, the press goes \u2013 headlines the next day \u2013 \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t want NATO, wants to disband NATO\u201d. And that\u2019s not what I said. \nI said, you\u2019ve got to pay your bills. And you know what? If you can\u2019t pay your bills, honestly, there should be \u2013 they\u2019ve got to go because we can\u2019t do it. You know, this isn\u2019t 68 years ago. This isn\u2019t when it was originally formed like many, many years ago, many decades ago, and you have to re-do things. \nBut it is interesting. Some of the smartest people have said \u201cWhat Trump said is genius. It\u2019s obsolete. And you know what? It\u2019s true.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of people, a lot of countries being given a free ride. We can\u2019t have the free rides any more, folks. \n...Thank you. Well, we need somebody with that...And it\u2019s America first, folks. It\u2019s America first. \nSo then, as you know, North Korea is a big problem. North Korea is a problem. A problem that could be solved easily by China but they don\u2019t want to solve it because they want to tweak us. They\u2019re building in the South China Seas a massive military fort. You know what\u2019s going on. They shouldn\u2019t be doing that. \nAnd they\u2019re taking our money and, you know, you talk about the imbalance of trade, you talk about the kind of money. How about this? We owe China $1.7 trillion. \nNow, they take our money. They take our jobs...I\u2019m not angry at China. I\u2019m angry at our people and our leaders for letting it happen. \nI\u2019m not angry with China. If you can get away with it, you do it. \nBut they take our jobs, they take our money, they take our money. They take everything. \nWe owe them $1.7 trillion. That\u2019s sort of like a magic act. Doesn\u2019t it? Amazing. \nJapan, they send cars by the millions. They come off those boats. Los Angeles \u2013 I was there at the docks. I looked at the biggest boats you\u2019ve ever seen. Biggest, greatest ships you\u2019ve ever seen. The cars are pouring off the ships. We owe them $1.5 trillion. \nYou look at the jobs we have. Even in Wisconsin, I mean, you see the jobs, the manufacturing, it\u2019s all so down and so gloomy and throughout the United States. And it\u2019s a disaster what\u2019s going on in our country. We\u2019re not going to have jobs left. \nAnd they do it with manipulation of currency. And they do it with guile. They do it with so many different elements that our people don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening. \nOur politicians in most cases don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening. And when they do know what\u2019s happening and they let it happen, it\u2019s even worse. \nSo I\u2019m not taking money from anybody. I\u2019m self-funding my campaign. \nAnd we\u2019re going to get it. We\u2019re going to get it. \nNow, I look at this U.S. manufacturing \u2013 I mean, just look at this. Look at these charts. I mean, you can see them...This is where we\u2019re going. \nYou know that\u2019s not good. Right? This is where we\u2019re going. \nThere was one that I just saw. Just got this. It\u2019s like incredible. \nLook at this. This is U.S. manufacturing jobs rapidly decline since year 2000. Look at that chart. Another couple of years, there won\u2019t be any jobs. \nAnd the jobs we have now are bad jobs. These are bad jobs. These aren\u2019t good jobs. And everybody admits that. Even the other side says, \u201cWe agree. They\u2019re bad jobs.\u201d \nAnd the number that they talk about when they say 5% unemployment \u2013 it\u2019s a fictitious number. When you stop looking for a job, you\u2019re considered statistically employed. \nIt was a number that was made up years ago probably by president but certainly by politicians to make them look good, to make them look really good like the economy. \nThe economy is not good. The economy is bad. \nWe\u2019re sitting on a bubble. The banks have money. They give it to you for nothing if you\u2019re rich. If you\u2019re not rich, that\u2019s when you need the money, they don\u2019t loan it to you. So the people can\u2019t do jobs. \nProbably here you have some great companies, some really good smaller companies, you can\u2019t get the banks to give you money. The banks are controlled by the regulators. They system that this country is run under is out of control. \nAnd we\u2019re going to change it. We\u2019re going to bring back the jobs. We\u2019re going to bring back our companies. \nAnd you know I\u2019ve had such a response. And the reason I\u2019ve had response is because of that and then I look at the ads today. \nI\u2019m in hotel and I look at the ads and Cruz makes up these ads. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring back jobs\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s using my same language. \nHere\u2019s the problem. They don\u2019t know where to begin. They don\u2019t know where to begin. \nAnd if they did, Lyin\u2019 Ted, lyin\u2019, he comes up. Did you ever see a guy like this? Just look what he did with Ben Carson. \nBen Carson, who endorsed me by the way, is a great guy, and Lyin\u2019 Ted, remember in Iowa, he said \u201cBen has left the race. He\u2019s left the race.\u201d This was on election day. It\u2019s not like two days before or the day after. \u201cDuring the election, he left the race.\u201d Okay? And people believed him and thousands of votes were cast not for Ben but for Ted Cruz. It\u2019s pure deception. It\u2019s lying. \nAnd then there were many other things. And actually during one of the debates, Marco Rubio looked over and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re a liar.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou know, I never heard a politician call another politician liar so we can do it.\u201d So we now call him Lyin\u2019 Ted \u2013 Lyin\u2019. It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s crazy. \nI mean, what he does and what he says is just terrible. And you know, I\u2019ve met a lot tougher people but I\u2019ve never met any human that lied as much as him. \nAnd he comes in and you noticed the tremendous evangelical support I have? I have Jerry Falwell Jr. from Liberty University. I have all of these people. I have such incredible support. \nAnd the evangelicals \u2013 he thought he was going to get the evangelicals but they don\u2019t like liars and they see he lies so much. \nDo you ever see him \u2013 he walks up and he walks in with the Bible, held high. Right? Held high and then he starts to lie. \nBoy, he is bad. \nSo anyways, I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re going to fall for that. I really don\u2019t think that anybody is going to fall \u2013 he doesn\u2019t talk. He debates...I said, \u201cTed, take it easy. Just talk. Talk. Talk.\u201d \nBut we\u2019re doing really well. The whole thing is just working out. And I loved being here. You know, I\u2019ve been here for a long time. I\u2019ve been here for a long time. I\u2019m going here \u2013 we\u2019re going to stay tomorrow. We\u2019re going to have some, I think I\u2019m doing Fox and Friends tomorrow morning. I\u2019m doing some shows tomorrow. We\u2019re going to do some shows and we\u2019re going to be around and we\u2019re going to make sure \u2013 we want to bring this home. \nIf we can \u2013 you know, we have a movement going on, folks. And it\u2019s a movement of intelligence, actually. It\u2019s a movement of common sense. That\u2019s all it is. \nWe\u2019re not going to let Carrier make air conditioners, fire all of its people, move to Mexico, make the air conditioners then come in and take the money out of the country. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore. \n\u201cOn her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. \u2018Oh well,\u2019 she cried, \u2018I\u2019ll take you in, and I\u2019ll take care of you.\u2019 \u2018Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in for heaven\u2019s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman,\u2019 cried the broken snake. She wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silk and then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk. Now she hurried home from work that night. As soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she\u2019d taken in had been revived. \u2018Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in for heaven\u2019s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman,\u2019 sighed the broken snake. Now she clutched him to her bosom. \u2018You\u2019re so beautiful,\u2019 she cried. \u2018But if I hadn\u2019t brought you in by now, heaven\u2019s sake you might have died.\u2019 Now she stroke his pretty skin and then she kissed him and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite. \u2018Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in for heaven\u2019s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman,\u2019 sighed the very, very healthy snake. \u2018I saved you,\u2019 cried the woman, \u2018And you bit me. Heaven\u2019s why? You know your bite is poisonous and now I\u2019m going to die.\u2019 \u2018Oh shut up, silly woman,\u2019 said the reptile with a grin. \u2018You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.\u2019\u201d \nRight? \nThat\u2019s what\u2019s happening to our country, folks. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening to our country and we can\u2019t let it happen. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant. We have to be strong. And if we\u2019re not, we\u2019re not going to have a country. \nAnd we need borders and we\u2019re going to have borders. \nAnd we need great trade deals and we\u2019re going to make great trade deals. \nAnd we can\u2019t let Mexico and I have great respect for Mexico and I respect their leaders but we can\u2019t let Mexico and China and any country you want to name steal our business, steal our jobs. \nWhen you look at what\u2019s happening in Wisconsin \u2013 and you see it \u2013 the reason I beat your governor and I beat him badly was I just read off the statistics. I just read \u2013 all I did, I stood up and I read statistics. You\u2019re losing jobs...It\u2019s very average. It\u2019s very average. \nOur country is less than average. Okay? Our country is doing so badly. And it\u2019s just one of those things and we have to smarten up and we have to get really tough. We have to get so, so, so vigilant and not be so politically correct. We have to do what\u2019s right for our country. \nWhen the great Ford Motor Company \u2013 great company \u2013 when they build a $2.5 billion plant in Mexico, when Nabisco moves its massive plant to Mexico from Chicago, we can\u2019t let it happen. \nWhen Carrier Air Conditioners, as you know, they just announced they\u2019re moving to Mexico. \nPfizer is moving to Ireland. \nBut let me just tell you. So, I watched the politicians and they have no business instincts. But more importantly, they\u2019re taken care of. \nYou know, a lot of friends come up to me and they say, \u201cDonald, let me ask you a question. These politicians \u2013 are they really that dumb?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, they\u2019re not actually that dumb. Some are. But they\u2019re not actually that dumb. They\u2019re all taken care of by the special interests. And when you want something done, you see certain people in Washington.\u201d \nHey, who is better than me? I mean, take a look at me. I was before June 16th, I was a part of the establishment and they will do not what\u2019s right for you but they will do what\u2019s right for the company they represent or the country they represent and the United States continues to get ripped off, ripped off, ripped off. \nAnd a lot of times, I\u2019ll say, \u201cHow can a deal be so stupidly made? These people are so stupid.\u201d They\u2019re not stupid. They\u2019re doing it for themselves. They\u2019re doing it because they want campaign contributions. They\u2019re doing it because they want money put in their PACs. They are totally controlled by the money. Believe me. They are totally controlled by the money, and that\u2019s not good for our country. Okay? That\u2019s not good because terrible things are happening and we\u2019re getting weaker and weaker. \nHundreds of thousands and even millions of jobs are being taken out.  \nAnd that\u2019s like a prizefighter. You know, they go into unfriendly territory, and the champ, he goes in. And they say, \u201cWhat do you think? You may have an unfriendly decision.\u201d He says, \u201cNo, when you knock them out, there\u2019s no unfriendly decision.\u201d \nIf we get the delegates, we\u2019ve pulled out a knock-out. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be, and I can see that happening because more and more people are calling, they want to get on board. \nFrankly, when I looked at what happened \u2013 a friend of mine, who\u2019s a great \u2013 you know, one of my great friends, he lives right down \u2013 not very far from here. And he said, \u201cWith Wisconsin, you\u2019re going win.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, what do you think? But I\u2019m not seeing polls that are great. I\u2019m a little bit down. I\u2019m down in some. I\u2019m a little bit down.\u201d He says, \u201cNo, no, you\u2019re going to win. But you have to be there. You have to come in and you have to talk to the people.\u201d Like we did this afternoon at the hangar. And he said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to win. I mean, you\u2019re going to win.\u201d He\u2019s a very smart guy, I want to tell you. Great guy. But he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to come in.\u201d \nWe\u2019ve been making \u2013 I\u2019ve been making speeches, three today, four yesterday, three or four the other day. We\u2019re here constantly. You\u2019re going to get so sick of me. You\u2019re going to say, \u201cOh, get him the hell out of here.\u201d \nNo, we are making so much progress and it\u2019s been so inspiring to see the people. I mean, look at even you people. You don\u2019t sit down. If you want, you can. Oh, stay up. Stand up. What the heck? Hey, we\u2019ve got plenty of time to sit down, right? We\u2019ve got plenty of time. \nBut I do appreciate that. That\u2019s a sign of affection, and it\u2019s a sign of respect, and I really do appreciate it. That\u2019s really nice. \nSo we have to bring our country back and so many different things. \nWith China, we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year. \nWith Mexico, we will build a wall. We will have strong borders. Strong borders. Believe me. We have a trade deficit of $58 billion a year. The wall\u2019s going to cost $10 billion to build. And people, the politicians are saying, \u201cHow can you possibly get them to pay?\u201d \nLet me tell you something, folks. We have some good business people in this audience. \nWhen you have a $58 billion deficit, and you have a $10 billion wall, that\u2019s real easy. And that\u2019s on a yearly basis the $58 billion. It\u2019s really easy. \nAnd they don\u2019t understand it. They said, \u201cHow are you going to get them to pay?\u201d \nI said, \u201cIt\u2019s so easy.\u201d And you understand it. Just rely on me. Okay? Rely. So easy. That\u2019s so easy. And we\u2019re going to have a strong border. \nYou know, two days ago I was greatly honored because the Border Patrol, the folks that do a great job, and they\u2019re told to stand back but they don\u2019t want to stand back. They want to do their job properly. They\u2019re proud people. They\u2019re incredible people. Frankly, before the wall goes up, we might not even need the wall, but we\u2019re building it anyway. Okay? We\u2019re building it. Believe me. \nBut the Border Patrol people are unbelievable people, and its 15,500 people gave me an endorsement two days ago. And I didn\u2019t ask for it. I didn\u2019t know. \nFirst time, first time they\u2019ve ever done it. Right? First time, they\u2019ve ever done it and they gave me an endorsement. And it\u2019s so important. \nNow, Sheriff Joe [Arpaio] from Arizona. You know, I won Arizona very big, and Sheriff Joe was with me and it was incredible and we love it. \nLook, we have to have strong borders. We can\u2019t let the Syrians come in that we have no idea who they are, where they\u2019re coming from. We don\u2019t know if they\u2019re Syrians. \nThis could be the all-time great Trojan horse. Who knows? \nI have as big a heart as anybody. We want to help them. We want to build safe zones in Syria. \nI want to get the Gulf States to pay for it. The Gulf States have nothing but money. We don\u2019t have money. We will run it. We will do a good job. We\u2019ll get it done but let somebody else pay for it for a change. We can\u2019t do it. \n...I keep getting these requests. You know, Al Green \u2013 the great Al Green wrote \u201cThe Snake\u201d. How many people have heard \u201cThe Snake\u201d? How many people? Oh, do you want to hear \u201cThe Snake\u201d? Do you want to hear it? I mean, people love it and I love it because it says what\u2019s going to happen to us if we\u2019re not careful. \nAnd this really pertains to allowing people into our country that we know are going \u2013 we\u2019re going to have problems. We\u2019re going to have huge problems. Allowing people in from areas of the world we don\u2019t know where they come from. We don\u2019t know where their documents are. They say they don\u2019t have documents. They have no papers. No nothing. We let them in. How stupid can we be? \nSo this is called \u201cThe Snake\u201d and I think it\u2019s pretty good. All right? Are you ready for this? A couple of you have heard it but some of you haven\u2019t. \nAnd by the way, if you want, you could put your name up and you say \u201cI want to run\u201d and you go to the convention and you run. \nBut it would be nice to see \u2013 because I\u2019ll tell you what, he takes my votes away much more than he does Cruz. And I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate. \nBut you know what? If we have to live with him, we still beat him easily. Okay, folks? I mean, okay? \nBut Kasich voted for NAFTA. NAFTA was a disaster for Wisconsin and it was a disaster for our country. \nTed Cruz wants TPP and it is going to make NAFTA look like peanuts. What they\u2019re doing to us with those documents, and Cruz is the one that insisted that we can\u2019t talk about money manipulation, which is devaluation of currencies in the agreement. He wouldn\u2019t let them do it. He\u2019s the one that fought currency devaluation. That\u2019s the single biggest tool that other countries have for taking our business, taking our money, and taking our jobs. And we can\u2019t let this go on any longer. \nNow, they\u2019re controlled by their PACs. They\u2019re controlled by the people that put up their campaign contributions. They\u2019re controlled, you know, with the lobbyists in Washington. They have signs on their forehead. It\u2019s like stamped into their forehead \u2013 \u201cI take care of Cruz.\u201d They\u2019re specialists. \u201cI take care of Kasich.\u201d \u201cI take care of Hillary.\u201d \nOh, Hillary. Ayeyeye. \u201cTake care of Hillary.\u201d \nSo we can\u2019t let it happen anymore. We can\u2019t let it happen anymore. \nIt\u2019s time \u2013 you know Obama used to say, \u201cTime for change\u201d? I\u2019ll say it\u2019s time for change but real change this time not that change. Real change. \nObama yesterday \u2013 President Obama yesterday for the first time he started having reservations about the Iran deal. I could have told him that six months ago, nine months ago, long before it was signed. The ink isn\u2019t even dry and now he\u2019s finally starting to understand it was a big beautiful mistake and it\u2019s only going to get worse. \nAnd by the way, Iran is getting worse. They were supposed to come into the community. Remember? What a bunch of babies. Are we babies? Are we babies? Hello over there. \nThey were supposed to come into the community and they were supposed to, you know, get involved. \nNow, you see they just ordered 118 Airbus jets. Those are the big jets. 100. They didn\u2019t order Boeing. \nThe reason \u2013 one of the reasons is we restrict them from spending. So we give them $150 billion and they\u2019re not even allowed to give us money by investing, by buying our products. Okay? How crazy are we? How much longer is it going to last? When are we going to get smart? When are we going to stop? \nWe as a country are being ripped off. We are being ripped off by virtually every single country in the world. Okay? Whether it\u2019s militarily or trade. \nWe don\u2019t win anymore. We can\u2019t win with the military. We can\u2019t beat ISIS. \nCan you imagine Gen. MacArthur or Gen. George Patton? They say get rid of ISIS. What do you think? \n...It\u2019s so sad to see what\u2019s happening to our country and we\u2019re going to turn it around and we\u2019re going to change it. And we\u2019re going to make it rich again, and we\u2019re going to make it strong again. \nSo, and so many different elements, and I\u2019ve been talking about trade. I always talk about trade. \nBecause when I announced on June 16th coming down the escalator with Melania, it was like the Academy Awards. There were so many cameras; I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. So many cameras. And I took a deep breadth and I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Because we have to do it. \nYou know, it takes guts. Running for president, believe me, takes guts. It takes a lot of guts. Believe me. \nAnd even for the politicians they run at least they\u2019re out on the line, and then you see the dishonesty. You see where I won Louisiana and then I find out that I\u2019m not supposed to get as many delegates as the person that I beat. What kind of stuff is that? \nAnd somebody said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s a rule and another rule.\u201d I don\u2019t care about rules, folks. I go out and I campaign. We win. We win. We get the delegates. Right? \nBut in the meantime, we have millions more votes than Cruz. We\u2019ve beaten him in most of the states. I mean, we\u2019re just winning so much. And we\u2019re winning by almost 300 delegates. \nSo we\u2019re doing great. And I think we close it out before the convention. I think we actually close it out before the convention. \nAnd she\u2019s going through a very hard time. And she has been so supportive and so like just incredible of what we\u2019re all \u2013 what we\u2019re trying to do. Not me. I\u2019m a messenger. What we\u2019re trying to do \u2013 make America great again and bring it back and stop letting the world take advantage of us both militarily and we don\u2019t win anymore. \nWe don\u2019t win anymore. We don\u2019t win with trade. We don\u2019t win with the military. \nWe pay for everybody else\u2019s military. \nWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. \nAnd she saw it and she was here early. And she knows that we\u2019re going to take care of our people, and it\u2019s going to be America first. It\u2019s got to be America first. We have no choice. We have no choice. \nAnd she\u2019s with a friend of hers who\u2019s very well-known, Chelsea Cooley, who is a tremendous, tremendous woman and just an amazing person. Also a great singer but I won\u2019t even mention that because Chelsea would be the last to want to have people know that. Chelsea is such a great friend of Melissa Young and Melissa Young \u2013 I just want to bring her and Chelsea onto the stage and maybe Melissa would like to say something and Chelsea. But this is just an unbelievable woman. \nSo could I ask Melissa to come up on stage please? \nMelissa Young: \nOh, I love you too. Most of all, I love this man. I promise I won\u2019t cry this time. I\u2019m going to pull it together. \nThis is the greatest man I have ever met. His heart is made of pure gold. \nHe saved me in so many ways and changed my world. \nYes, he gave me a lot of gifts in my life \u2013 the gift of compassion and showing my son how to pay it forward. \nBut above that, if this man becomes president of the United States of America, he is going to give me the best gift ever and that is I\u2019ll know that when I leave this world, I won\u2019t be here to watch my son grow but I\u2019ll know that he is going to grow up in a country that is safe. That\u2019s what every mother wishes for. \nAnd please, my fellow Wisconsinites, please, tomorrow vote for Mr. Trump. Give yourselves that sense of peace. Give that to your children. \nThis is the greatest man I have ever met and he is going to make America great again. \nThank you all so much. God bless you. \nShe was so amazing the way she walked up here and just spoke from the heart, and we all have to speak from the heart. \nAnd you noticed no teleprompters? We don\u2019t have teleprompters. We want to do it right from here and from here and from here. \nBut I just want to \u2013 I saw Melissa, and I said, \u201cI have to have you up\u201d because her story\u2019s an amazing story and it\u2019s a story of courage and we\u2019re going to work with her family and we\u2019re going to make sure everything goes well. \nOkay, thank you all very much. \nSo, in coming over today and in going through a few of them, I said to a few of the folks I\u2019ve got to explain what\u2019s happening because our country is being decimated by stupidity, by bad deals, by horrible trades, by TPP, which Cruz wants badly and which is going to destroy Wisconsin. \nThis Trans-Pacific Partnership is a disaster. Cruz is pushing it hard. \nKasich, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a player here. I mean, the guy is one in 32. He\u2019s one and it was in his own state. And if I would have campaigned there two more days instead of staying in Florida, I would have won in my opinion Ohio. He\u2019s one and 32. \nNow, in all fairness, Jeb Bush was doing a lot better than that. Many people were doing better. It\u2019s called you get out. He\u2019s taking my votes. We have to get over 50%. And how do you do that? \nLook, at a certain point in life, what you do is you say, \u201cI\u2019m one in 32. In other words, I\u2019ve won one out of 32 states,\u201d and you do what Marco did, which was great, and you do what Rand Paul did, and you do what a lot of them did, and you get out. \n...We did this as a quickie. We wanted to come into this area. We\u2019re staying here tonight. \nAnd I know you have a baseball game, you have a big basketball game. We\u2019re going to go really quickly tonight. \nBut we\u2019re going to say one thing: We\u2019re going to make America great again. Remember that. Make America great again because that\u2019s what matters. \nSo, I brought somebody very, very special along. I wonder who that could be? I wonder. \nAnd she\u2019s an incredible woman. She\u2019s an incredible mother. She loves her son Barron so much. And just really something special. And I have to say she will make an unbelievable First Lady. \nSo I\u2019d like to introduce my wife, Melania. Thank you. \nMelania Trump: \nHello! \nIt is wonderful \u2013 thank you. We love you too. \nIt is wonderful to be here today with you and with my husband. \nI\u2019m very proud of him. He\u2019s hard worker. He\u2019s kind. He has a great heart. He\u2019s tough. He\u2019s smart. He\u2019s a great communicator. He\u2019s a great negotiator. \nHe\u2019s telling the truth. He\u2019s a great leader. He\u2019s fair. \nAs you may know by now, when you attack him, he will punch back 10 times harder. \nNo matter who you are \u2013 a man or a woman \u2013 he treats everyone equal. \nHe\u2019s a fighter, and if you elect him to be your president, he will fight for you and for our country. \nHe will work for you, and with you and together, we will make America strong and great again.  \nThank you. \nThank you very much. I want to thank Melania for that. That was very special. \nYou know, Wisconsin\u2019s a really special place, and we\u2019ve been all over today. Speeches all over. We had one before. Thousands and thousands of people standing outside of an airplane hangar because the hangar was packed. And we had another one in the morning, and it\u2019s been an amazing day, and some phenomenal results. \nYou see what\u2019s happening with the polls. Boom! Like a rocket ship. It\u2019s like a rocket. \nI guess I just heard when I walked in one just came out that we\u2019re 10 points up. But don\u2019t worry about that. Pretend you didn\u2019t hear that. Go out and vote tomorrow. Okay? Go out and vote tomorrow. \nYou know, I always tell \u2013 I used to say this to politicians that run that\u2019d be friends of mine, I\u2019d say, \u201cPretend you\u2019re a little bit behind. Okay? That way you\u2019d work hard. You\u2019d never forget.\u201d \nBut you know, there\u2019s somebody that was \u2013 I saw just a little while ago in the audience a very special woman, an incredible woman, and Melania just said hello and met her was so taken, and she represented you so beautifully. And some of you know who she is. Many of you know who she is. \nBut she was Miss Wisconsin. She has one of the most incredible spirits that I\u2019ve ever seen. She\u2019s got her husband and her son and her son is absolutely magnificent and she loves him more than anything that you can imagine.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I\u2019m Pete Saenz. I\u2019m the mayor of Laredo, Texas. And we\u2019re excited to have Mr. Donald Trump here in Laredo, Texas. \nIt has provided us an opportunity to present to Mr. Trump and his entourage what Laredo is all about. \nYou know, Laredo is the number one land port in the nation. We do \u2013 Laredo, per se, does over 40% of the Mexican trade. \nLaredo is known for obviously transportation. You could see the big trucks behind us and logistics. \nWe are \u2013 NAFTA has been very good to us. We\u2019re excited about that. \nWe also have oil and gas production at the county and it also provides a revenue to us. \nMr. Trump has brought up certain issues \u2013 about the immigration issue in particular. \nWe, at least I feel personally, that immigration reform is required, is needed. We need protection in the border area. We need to secure the border but we also need other elements. You know, obviously, the immigration act or bill. \nSo with that in mind, it\u2019s a pleasure to have Mr. Trump. The excitement that he brings is also very on the plus side for our city, and we appreciate all of the attention but we know that the attention comes from really through this gentleman here. \nMexico is booming, absolutely booming. \nAnd Jesus \u2013 the city manager \u2013 and Pete have done an amazing job right here. But a lot of what\u2019s happening here is because of the fact that Mexico is doing so well. Just doing beyond what anybody ever thought and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good for the United States but it\u2019s good for Mexico... \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nSo I have a great relationship. Over the years, thousands and thousands of Hispanics have worked for me and now work for me, and the relationship is very good. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible] You keep saying there\u2019s danger but the crime along the border is down. What danger are you talking about? \nQuestion:\nHave you seen any evidence here to confirm your fears about Mexico sending its criminals across the border? \nAnd in fact, as you know, the border patrol was the one that invited me. I think most of you have that invitation. We sent it. The border patrol invited me and then they cancelled because frankly they don\u2019t want to get involved...The reason they invited me was because of the tremendous problem and the tremendous crime and all of the things that I\u2019ve been talking about. \nSo they invited me and then at the last moment \u2013 I mean, we were virtually in the air \u2013 and they said, \u201cWe can\u2019t get involved.\u201d And I heard they got those orders from Washington. \nQuestion:\nWhat evidence specifically have you seen? \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nCome on, Jesus, say a word. This man \u2013 I\u2019m going to steal him to run something for me. He\u2019s fantastic. \nLaredo City Manager Jesus Olivares:\nThank you, Mr. Trump. Welcome everybody to the city of Laredo. \nYou know, this is one of the greatest cities on the border and we\u2019re a vibrant city. \nAnd as Mr. Trump mentioned, you know, the trade that we have here with Mexico, this is where the rubber meets the road. And all of you can see it right behind us, this is where all the trade comes through that Mexico and the United States have in common right here. \nAnd not only that but this is where it goes to the rest of the world. \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you, what we wouldn\u2019t be where we are if it wouldn\u2019t be for the support that Mayor and members of the City Council that are also here with us \u2013 Mr. Councilmember [Juan] Narvaez and Councilmember [Alejandro] Perez \u2013 we are very fortunate to have the support that they provide us in order for this city to be such a great city and the number one inland port in the country. \nThank you. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]...The way to secure the border is to build a long wall? \nLaredo City Manager Jesus Olivares:\nWell, that\u2019s a federal issue and we have our comments. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary at this time. I think there\u2019s other ways that we can work together with the federal government. \nI think right now, we have a process that we work together with Border Patrol, CBP, and everybody to be able to get some of these things done. \nThe relationship that the city of Laredo has with the federal government with all the law enforcement agencies is a tremendous one. Thank you. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\nWhat will you actually do to change the illegal immigration? \n...You have to create \u2013 you have to make the people that come in, they have to be legal. Very simple. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nThey want to do their job. That\u2019s why they invited me. They invited me. I didn\u2019t come here. \nThe border patrol invited me because they got such a problem. \nThey want to be able to do their job. If they can\u2019t do their job, believe me, they\u2019re unhappy. They want to be able to do their job. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible] Are you still in favor of a wall across the entire border? \nBy the way, the wall will save you a tremendous amount of money, but you absolutely \u2013 there are areas you have to have the wall. \nQuestion:\n...Threats from El Chapo? \nQuestion:\nFrom El Chapo? The drug cartel leader? \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nThe best way to win is for me to get the nomination and run probably against Hillary. Hillary is the worst. Look, easily, she\u2019s the worst Secretary of State in the history of our country. She\u2019s going to be beaten and I\u2019m the one to beat her. \nAnd I will take jobs back. And the reason I won with the Hispanic vote and I win all over with the Hispanic vote because they know I\u2019ll take jobs back from China, I\u2019ll take jobs back from Japan, and every other country that\u2019s killing us. I\u2019ll bring the jobs back. \nAnd you know, the Hispanics are get those jobs and they\u2019re going to love Trump and they already do. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\nWhat will you do with the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are already here? \nThank you very much. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech on a \u201cNew Deal\u201d for urban America", "text": "Here\u2019s a woman, she makes a speech for fifteen minutes. She goes home, goes to bed. \nHonestly? She has less energy than Jeb Bush. \nAnd the reason I bring him up \u2013 he didn\u2019t sign the pledge so he\u2019s open game. So he signed the pledge, right? But he didn\u2019t honor it. How do you live with yourself? You know? \nHe signs a pledge and he doesn\u2019t \u2013 so we figured. But how do you like that and then she had a speech today. She criticized me for going to the opening of this building, which was in and out. It\u2019s not the way life works. \nBut I was also there for another reason. The workers. They did a magnificent job. They were there. And without them, it could never have been built so quickly or so beautifully. \nThe rebuilding we did at the Old Post Office is the rebuilding I want to do for our country. We\u2019re going to rebuild our country. \nI want to go into the inner cities, the poor rural communities and the failing schools, and I want to work on a national plan for total revitalization. We\u2019re going to be so proud of our country again. \nI\u2019m tired of the excuses from our lame politicians. I\u2019m tired of being told that it can\u2019t be done. I\u2019m tired of people asking Americans to defer their dreams for another day but they really mean for many decades. \nEnough waiting. The time is now. There is nothing we cannot accomplish. There is no task or project too great. There is no dream outside of our reach. \nEverywhere I go in this country, all I see is untapped potential, waiting to be set free. And maybe the greatest of that potential is in the African-American communities. There\u2019s so much potential. \nBut we will never realize that potential if we continue putting our faith in a broken political system that has let us down time and time again. \nWe have to choose the more optimistic path. We have to choose to believe not in our politicians, not in these people that got us there, but to believe in ourselves and the future of our country. \nIf we do that, anything is possible. \nSo I\u2019m asking America to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future. \nLet\u2019s close the history book on the failures in Washington, and let\u2019s open a new chapter of success and prosperity for everyone, especially now, especially for our African-American communities. And that\u2019s going to happen. \nI am very humbled beyond words to be the nominee of the party of Abraham Lincoln. A lot of people don\u2019t know that. It\u2019s the party of Abraham Lincoln. \nAnd it is my highest and greatest hope that the Republican Party can be the home in the future and forever more for African-Americans and the African-American vote because I will produce and I will get others to produce and we know for a fact that it doesn\u2019t work with the Democrats and it certainly isn\u2019t going to work with Hillary. \nTogether, we will have a government of, by, and for the people. \nAnd we will make America great again for all Americans. \nThank you very much. God bless you, everybody. Great honor to be here. Thank you. God bless you. What an honor. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you all. \nNow, if I said that, I\u2019d be in big trouble. \nShe tried an Asia pivot and that failed. \nNow Hillary Clinton wants to confront nuclear-armed Russia with a shooting war in Syria that could very well lead us into World War III. For what? She doesn\u2019t get it. She doesn\u2019t understand. \nRemember, her top person says she has bad instinct. She\u2019s got bad instincts. \nAnd by the way, we want to be so strong. We want to make our military so strong. We want to take care of our vets better than they\u2019ve ever been taken care of. \nPeace through strength. Peace through strength. We have no choice. These are very vicious times. This is not a time to have a depleted, a depleted military. We\u2019re not going to have that. We have the greatest people in the world in the military. We\u2019re not going to have that but we are going to take care of our vets also. \nFinally, our opponents passed a health care law embraced by Hillary Clinton over the furious objections of the American voter and most politicians... \nHe lied and lied. You can have your plan. You can have your doctor 28 different times. And enough Democrats went over to that side. They made a mistake. \nObamacare is now destroying our health care system. \nPremiums are skyrocketing double digits and are surging by more than 100%. \nAnd think of it, in the great state of Arizona, I love Arizona. It\u2019s going up 118%. \nOh, but don\u2019t worry you\u2019re going to catch that too first. \nDoctors are quitting, insurers are leaving, and companies are fleeing. \nEvery prediction they made about this law was a lie, and I said it was going to be no good before it was ever passed. \nIf we don\u2019t repeal and replace Obamacare, we will lose our health care system forever. \nWe have to get rid of it. It\u2019s a disaster. It\u2019s too expensive. It doesn\u2019t work. And you get no coverage. The deductible is so high that you\u2019ll essentially never use it. \nNow is the time to embrace a new direction. \nI\u2019ve been very lucky and I\u2019ve led a great life. Now I want to give back to the country which I love and which is been so good to me. \nI just left a hotel \u2013 beautiful, beautiful building. It was the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. and it\u2019s mine. And it was just built. It\u2019s right between the Capitol building and the White House. \nSo this way, I figure I\u2019ll get to Washington one way or the other, right? Pennsylvania Avenue. \nBut I\u2019m very proud of it and I\u2019m very proud of my children because we delivered it under budget and ahead of schedule creating thousands of jobs, including construction. \nIt will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world and a great symbol for our country for many years to come. \nI took two hours to fly in to Washington to cut the ribbon with my children and then jump on the plane to be here with you. Just did it. \nI wanted to be there for my children, who worked so hard on the hotel. They worked so hard, in particular, Ivanka in this case. \nAnd I always feel this. I feel this so strongly, parents must stick and encourage and support their children. \nIt would have been very bad. They work, work, work 24 hours a day, always working and then you say I\u2019m not going. Takes the heart out of them, right? Don\u2019t you think? I mean? They did a great job in the hotel and I told them so. \nAnd Hillary said Donald Trump took time off the campaign. Can you believe it? \nHere\u2019s a woman who goes home and she goes to sleep all the time. Think of it. She\u2019s got no energy whatsoever. \nEveryone\u2019s talking about the fact that I\u2019ll do seven, eight, nine stops. I\u2019ll make three or four major speeches, like for instance right after this, we have thousands and thousands of people in North Carolina coming to another one. Last night, 25,000 people. I got home at one o\u2019clock in the morning. \nUnlike Hillary, who does nothing, does nothing, for the Hispanics or the African-American community. \nIt will be my mission to prove to this country that yesterday does not have to be tomorrow. \nThe vicious cycle of poverty can be broken and great new things can happen for all of our people. Great new things can happen. \nBut to achieve this future, we must reject the failed elites from Washington who have been wrong about virtually everything happening for decades. \nHey, they have been wrong about the wars. They\u2019ve been wrong about jobs. They\u2019ve been wrong about everything. \nAnd the question is, are they stupid? The question is, are they stupid or do they have a plan? \nI actually think, for the most part, they have a plan, but some are not too smart. \nAnd you\u2019re right about the swamp. Say it again. Right? You better believe it. \nBoy, that is...That is a...You know I said that week ago, and they didn\u2019t like it that much. It didn\u2019t sound that great. The whole world picked it up. So it shows you what I know. It\u2019s crazy. \nDrain the swamp. We\u2019re going to drain the swamp of Washington. We\u2019re going to have fun doing it. We\u2019re all doing it together. That is funny. \nFunny how things like that happen. I was listening the other day to a great singer, great, one of the great legends, and said that certain said \u201cDidn\u2019t like it, Didn\u2019t like it.\u201d It became one of the greatest hits of all time. So drain the swamp. I didn\u2019t like it. Now I love it, right? \nThe people opposing us promised that passing NAFTA and opening up our markets to China would bring a new era of jobs and prosperity. That didn\u2019t happen. Instead, they brought only poverty and heartache and loss. \nThe people opposing us are the same people who we\u2019ve, and think of this, who\u2019ve wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East. We could have rebuilt our country twice. That have produced only more terrorism, more deaths, more suffering. \nImagine if that money had been spend right here in our home. \nWe\u2019ve totally destabilized the Middle East, and if you think about it, $6 trillion and was far better 15 years ago. So we\u2019ve made it worse. \nWe\u2019ve spent $6 trillion, lost thousands of lives. You could say hundreds of thousands of lives because look at the other side also. So we lost hundreds and thousands of lives and we\u2019re far worse off than we were when we started. \nWho are the people that do this? \nAnd we end the war in such a bad way that a vacuum is formed, and we have ISIS. And that was the JV, the junior varsity, but now the JV is violent and vicious and ensconced in 32 different nations. And the one that gave us the JV now says how she\u2019s going to get rid of it. Not going to happen, folks. Just words. Just words. Just words. \nFor 30 years she\u2019s been talking. For 30 years, only bad things happened for her. \nShe tried to build democracy in Libya, and she failed. \nShe tried to build democracy in Iraq, and she failed. \nShe tried regime change in Egypt, and that was a disaster. \nShe pressed regime change in Syria, and that failed. \nShe tried a Russian reset; that was laughed at. Laughed at. \nPutin has no respect for her whatsoever. \nSee, I\u2019m not allowed to say it, but I\u2019ll accept it. \nWho said that? A star is born. \nIt\u2019s so bad. You look at your roads and you look at your everything. You look at your schools and hospitals. Everything is so bad. \nI will also cancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama plan. \nWe\u2019re giving billions and billions of dollars away. We have no idea for what and others aren\u2019t doing so much. Believe me, they are laughing. I\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re laughing at us. Including all global warming payments to the United Nations. Billions of dollars. \nAnd listen to this, these steps will save $100 billion over eight years. And this money will be used to help rebuild the vital infrastructure, including water systems in America\u2019s inner-cities. \nYou see Flint, Michigan and what\u2019s happened there. But it\u2019s horrible. I was there and it is unbelievable, horrible, incompetent politicians doing the wrong thing. \nSchool choice is at the center of my plan. Such a great thing. \nAnd by the way, we\u2019re going to terminate Common Core and bring education local. So important. \nLook, it\u2019s not working the way it is now. I don\u2019t know why anybody would even fight it. Well, we know who\u2019s fighting it. You know that. \nMy proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child in America to attend the public, private, charter, magnate, religious, or home school of their choice. \nSchool choice is the great civil rights issue of our time, and I will be the nation\u2019s biggest cheerleader for school choice in all 50 states. What a difference it will make. \nI will also be establishing a commission which will include some of the tremendous people I met back stage today. Raise your hands. I mean, you people were so great. Some great ideas. To tackle the school to prison pipeline and to shut that pipeline down and to create \u2013 so important \u2013 to create a new pathway that leads from a great education instead to a great job. That\u2019s what we want. It isn\u2019t school to prison. \nMy plan will also ensure funding for historical black colleges and universities, more affordable two and four year college more affordable, and support for trade and vocational education. \nYou know, I\u2019ve gone to school with many people, some totally brilliant at one thing but not at all brilliant at others. \nBut we all know this. We\u2019ve all had students who have sat next to us in class, and they were terrible students. But they were phenomenal at fixing a car engine. They were phenomenal at fixing a television set. They can take it apart blindfolded. And I can\u2019t do that and you can\u2019t do that. But they were phenomenal at fixing things. We don\u2019t do that anymore. \nRemember we used to have this great vocational education? They were talented. They were great. They were horrible students and they were great. They can take a motor, they can take an engine apart blindfolded. \nAnd we have to bring that back. And that\u2019s what they love doing. That\u2019s what they love doing. And they\u2019ll do fantastically with it. \nDon\u2019t you think? Right? So true. So we\u2019re going to get that going again. \nFinally today, my agenda includes the protection of religious liberty. \nIt\u2019s great. Nice to see. Very nice to see. \nThat\u2019s something you will never hear from Hillary Clinton, that I can tell you. \nThe promotion of family and support for the African-American church. It\u2019s been a tremendous power in this country for so many years. \nThis is just the beginning, because I will never, ever take the African-American community for granted. Never ever. \nYou know, our national security was put at unbelievable risk with what she was doing and not even face so much as a minor fine. \nNow think of it. A major general, a man, four-star general, that\u2019s about the top, General James Cartwright lied one time to the FBI and he probably did it. He did it in my opinion for national security reasons. He may go to jail for five-year sentence. Think of it. Five years. He may go to jail for five years. One time to the FBI. \nShe lied \u2013 looks like hundreds of times. Hundreds of time. \nHey, how about she couldn\u2019t remember 39 times so each one of those 39 was a lie, right? \nEqual justice also means the same rules for Wall Street. The Obama administration never held Wall Street accountable. \nWe will also police our streets. We have to make our streets safe. \nI want every poor African-American child to be able to walk down the street in peace and not be scared and not be hurt. \nThe problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police. We need really a great group of people to keep you safe, to keep us all safe. To keep us all safe. \nYou know, the murder rate in the United States, I don\u2019t know if you know this because the press never talks about it, is the highest it\u2019s been \u2013 think of this \u2013 in 45 years. Nobody knows that. The murder rate \u2013 highest it\u2019s been in 45 years. \nI will invest in training and funding both local and federal law enforcement operations to remove the gang members, drug dealers, and criminal cartels from our nation. \nThe reduction of crime is not merely a goal. It\u2019s a necessity for all of us. We will get it done. \nThe war on police urged on by my rival is really reckless. What\u2019s happening is reckless and dangerous and puts African-American lives at risk. And all you have to do is look at the statistics and you see what\u2019s happening. \nWe must work with our police, not against them. We\u2019re going to work together. And we\u2019re going to have an amazing relationship because you know everybody wants the same thing. We all really want the same thing. \nOur immigration, that is, my policy on immigration is so simple. \nWe will restore the civil rights of African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans by ending illegal immigration, and yes, we will build the wall. We will build the wall. \nAnd we\u2019re going to stop the inflow, the massive inflow, of drugs, which is coming into your community more than any community but coming into your community and poisoning our youths and poisoning many other people. But poisoning our youths. \nI will reform visa rules to give American workers preference for jobs, and I will suspend reckless refugee admissions from terror-prone regions that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. \nA portion of the massive amounts of money saved by enforcing our laws and suspending refugees will be reinvested in our inner-cities. \nDon\u2019t forget, many of these refugees are coming from Syria and other parts of the world. We don\u2019t know where they\u2019re from, who they are, what their thought process is. And they\u2019re being let in by the thousands and thousands and thousands, and Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550% increase over what President Obama is allowing. \nWe don\u2019t what\u2019s going to happen. This is the story of the Trojan horse. This is your second Trojan horse guaranteed. \nI can tell you right now it\u2019s not happening. Not with me. It will be ending. That will be ending. \nWe have enough problems in our country. It\u2019s time to help the American citizens who have become refugees in their own country. \nInfrastructure will be another major goal. My contract calls for $1 trillion in infrastructure investment of which the inner-cities will be a major beneficiary. We need something done. \nI will also propose tax holidays for inner-city investment. A new tax incentive to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods. And they will do that. It will be worthwhile. It\u2019s called incentive. They will do it. \nI will further...I will further empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure, the demolition of abandoned properties, and the increased presence of law enforcement, so we have safety in our community. We need that. We need that...the safety is so bad. \nSome of our inner-cities are more dangerous than some of the war zones that we\u2019re reading about and seeing about every night. We have to stop that. \nI will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young African-Americans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities. It\u2019s gonna be beautiful. Such talent. Such a potential talent out there. It\u2019s so incredible, and it\u2019s totally being wasted...wasted by politicians who don\u2019t want to see it happen. \nDodd-Frank has been a disaster making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need. You folks know that. \nThe policies of the Clintons brought us the financial recession through lifting Glass-Steagall, pushing subprime lending, and blocking reforms to Fannie and Freddie. Two friendly names but they\u2019re not so friendly. \nIt\u2019s time for a 21st-century glass Glass-Steagall and as part of that a priority on helping African-American businesses get the credit they need. \nWe will also encourage small business creation by allowing social welfare workers to convert poverty assistance into repayable but forgivable micro-loans. Very simple but something so good. \nThen there\u2019s the issue of public safety. Making our communities safe again will be a priority for the Trump administration. Safe. \nThank you. I love you, too. \nNow I mean so many...so many people, so many people, I mean, you walk to the store to buy a loaf of bread maybe with your child and you get shot or your child get shot. Gotta stop it. No good. No good. We need safety. \nI have heard and have listened to the concerns raised by African-American citizens about our justice system. And I promise that under a Trump administration, the law will be applied fairly, equally, and without prejudice. There will be no prejudice. There will be only one set of rules, not a two-tiered system of justice like we have right now. \nYou just see that with Hillary Clinton. I mean, think of it, think of it. \nThink of it. She deletes 33,000 emails after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress, and she has no trouble. \nAnd in your community you know what you\u2019re going through. Can you imagine if you did that? \nCan you imagine if I did that? I\u2019d think that they reinstitute the electric chair. Forget about you. How about me? Would I be in trouble? \nIt is so unfair. It is so unfair that she\u2019s even allowed to run for the office of president. \nAnd then you probably read $675,000 went to the wife of the head of the FBI, who was in charge of the investigation to her campaign. No, no...is this is this too hard to believe? I mean, went to the head of the FBI\u2019s wife, who was in charge of the investigation of the Hillary Clinton email scandal. \nAnd then you wonder gee...I wonder why she got off? That is a serious horrible thing. Look, it\u2019s a horrible thing. It\u2019s...It\u2019s not even believable. I have people...great, great lawyers, they can\u2019t even believe what\u2019s happening. \nThe best evidence of unequal justice is that Hillary Clinton could violate so many laws, bleach and delete her 33,000 emails and especially after the subpoena from Congress, lied to Congress, lied to the FBI, put her national security at grave risk. \nPoliticians, Democratic politicians, Democratic policies have also given rise to crippling crime and total violence. \nThen there\u2019s the issue of taxation and regulation. \nMassive taxes, massive regulation of small business, and radical restrictions on American energy have drive jobs and opportunities out of our inner-cities, and in many cases, out of our country. \nHillary wants to raise taxes very, very substantially on everybody and on business. And especially on small business as high as 45%, which will only drive more jobs out of your community, out of our country and into other countries. \nOne of the greatest betrayals has been the issue of immigration. \nIllegal immigration violates the civil rights of African-Americans. That\u2019s what\u2019s been happening. \nNo group has been more economically harmed by decades of illegal immigration than the low-income African-American workers. \nHillary\u2019s pledge to enact open borders, made in secret to a foreign bank. \nWikileaks. Wikileaks is unbelievable. What we\u2019ve learned about her and her people. What they\u2019ve said about her behind her back. But now, it\u2019s not behind her back. \nShe\u2019s got bad instincts according to John Podesta. Hillary Clinton has bad instincts. \nI wouldn\u2019t want my people saying those things. I wonder what they\u2019re saying. Is there somewhere we can check it out? \nNo, they say terrible terrible things about her. So, I mean, if they say that and they work with her all the time, why would we want her to be president? \nAt the center of my revitalization plan is the issue of trade. \nMassive chronic trade deficits have emptied out our jobs. Just look at what\u2019s happened to Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and right here in North Carolina. You know that for a fact. \nIt\u2019s the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. \nIf I\u2019m president and the executives at Ford Motor Company announced they\u2019re moving their plants and jobs to Mexico, I will pick up the phone and make a very, very simple call. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s presidential, but I\u2019d rather do it myself. And who cares? Who cares? \nThank you...You\u2019re screaming, \u201cMake that call. Make that call.\u201d \nTakes me 5 minutes. I\u2019d rather do it myself. It will get done properly. \nI will tell those executives that if they move their factories to Mexico, I will put a 35% tax on their product, which in this case is small cars. \nYou know, they\u2019re moving their small-car plants out of mostly Michigan moving to Mexico. I mean, it\u2019s terrible. They\u2019re going to make their small cars. That\u2019s a big thing. It might be a small car, but it\u2019s a lot of business. \nBefore they ship it back to the United States, they\u2019re going to pay a tax. 35%. You tell them and you know what? They\u2019re going to stay. They\u2019re going to stay. They\u2019re not leaving. They\u2019re not leaving. \nBut nobody ever says that. The politicians don\u2019t say that because they\u2019re getting campaign contributions from these people and their special interests. So they\u2019re not going to say. \nMe, I\u2019m saying it. I\u2019m doing what\u2019s right. I\u2019m working for you, folks. We\u2019re going to get this thing right. We\u2019re going to get it right. \nSuch a big problem. Our jobs are leaving us and people are being fired all over the country. Our plants, our factories are leaving us. \nWe won\u2019t let your jobs be stolen from you anymore. It\u2019s not gonna happen. So easy. \nWhen we stop off-shoring to low-wage countries, we raise wages at home, meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable. \nAt the same time, my plan to lower the business tax from 35% to 15% will bring thousands of new companies onto our shores. \nYou\u2019ll have jobs. You\u2019ll have jobs. \nIt also includes a massive middle-class tax cut, tax-free child care savings accounts, and childcare tax deductions and credits. And a total simplification of the tax code. \nAnd I just want to thank those people right now. They are phenomenal people, so I want to say thank you very much. \nBut it\u2019s just more proof that we represent the kind of change that arrives only once in a lifetime. This is a movement that\u2019s once in a lifetime. Never going to happen again. Never going to have another opportunity. \nEvery day I\u2019m out on the trail proposing fresh solutions and new thinking, and every day, the same people getting rich off our broken system tell us that we can\u2019t change and that we can\u2019t try anything new because it\u2019s not good for them. \nI have a message for all of the doubters in Washington: America\u2019s future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics and not the critics. \nAnd it\u2019s time to extend that dream to every African-American citizen in this country. African-American citizens have sacrificed so much for our nation. They\u2019ve fought and died in every war since the Revolution, and from the pews and the picket lines, they\u2019ve lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for civil rights. \nYet, too many African-Americans have been left behind. Massive numbers have been left behind. \n45% of African-American children under the age of six live in poverty. \n58% of African-American youth are not currently employed. \nAfrican-Americans comprise roughly 13% of the population, yet make up 60% of murder victims under the age of 22. That\u2019s some number, isn\u2019t it though? Some number. \nIn 2015, violent crime in Charlotte increased by 18% and it\u2019s expected to rise to 24% this year. \nIn Chicago, nearly 3,500 people have been shot since Jan. 1st of this year. That\u2019s not a very long time ago. Think of it: 3,500 people. \nThe conditions of our inner-cities today are totally unacceptable and we have to fix them. \nThe Democrats have run our inner-cities for 50, 60, 70 years or more uninterrupted. They\u2019ve run the school boards, the city councils, the mayor\u2019s office, and the congressional seats. Their policies have failed and they failed miserably. \nThey\u2019ve trapped children in failing government schools and opposed school choice at every single turn. \nThe Clinton\u2019s gave us NAFTA, one of the worst economical deals in the history of any country. It\u2019s taken our jobs. It\u2019s taken our companies. It\u2019s taken everything \u2013 so much out of our country. \nAnd China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization. \nTwo deals that truly de-industrialized America, uprooted our industry, and stripped bare towns like Detroit and Baltimore and the inner-cities of North Carolina, where we are really focusing. \nAnd, by the way, you see the new polls coming out where we\u2019re really doing well? Which is okay. Thank you. We\u2019re going to win North Carolina. \nWe\u2019re going to win Florida. Actually, we\u2019re going to win Florida too. We\u2019re going to win Ohio, and we\u2019re going to win Iowa. We\u2019re winning a lot of states. \nYou get the little word back there. The media, they say, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on over here?\u201d \nYou have to see in Florida, they have lines that are four blocks long trying to get to the polling booths. They\u2019ve never seen that here. \nAnd same thing in many other states that have started. \nThis state has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary\u2019s NAFTA. Think of it: half. Decimating, by the way, and they have been decimated. Decimating the African-American community and the African-American middle class. Decimated. These jobs went to Mexico and other places. \n...Thank you. Thank you, pastor. A great, great honor. \nAnd it\u2019s great to be here in Charlotte to discuss an issue that means so much to me. That\u2019s the issue of urban renewal. Something you don\u2019t hear very much about. And the rebuilding of our inner cities. \nToday, I want to talk about how to grow the African-American middle class and how to provide a new deal for black America. \nThat deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education, and high paying jobs. \nMy vision rests on a principle that has defined this campaign right from the beginning and you\u2019ve seen where we have come from and where we are right now. It\u2019s called America first. \nEvery African-American citizen in this country is entitled to a government that puts their jobs, wages, and security first. \nI\u2019m asking today for the honor of your vote and the privilege to represent you as your president. \nAnd I will not let you down. You watch. \nHere\u2019s the promise I make to you. Whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion. \nWe live in a very divided country but I will be your greatest champion. \nI have no special interests. I take no orders from donors or lobbyists. I\u2019ve put a lot of money into this campaign. Believe me. I will be in for over $100 million. That\u2019s a lot! \nI work for you and I work only for you. \nOur campaign is about change, optimism, and the future. \nI\u2019m asking people to break from the bitter failures of the past and to imagine the amazing possibilities for our future and our future together. \nOur opponent represents the rigged system and the failed thinking of yesterday. \nHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign offers only the depressing pessimism that says this is as good as it gets and it\u2019s never going to get better. She\u2019s been doing this for 30 years and for 30 years it\u2019s only gotten worse. \nAmerican politics is caught in a time loop. We keep electing the same people over and over and over. \nAnd they keep coming back to the African-American community and the Hispanic community, and they keep talking about what they\u2019re going to do, and they don\u2019t do it and four years later you see them again. It\u2019s enough. \nThey keep making the same mistakes, and they keep offering the same old lame excuses when nothing happens. You know that. I know that. Frankly everybody knows that. \nThe fact that our corrupt Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our movement \u2013 we have a major movement there\u2019s never been anything like it in this country. \nAnd this is so important to me what I\u2019m saying here today. I wanted a small group of very, very powerful, influential people from the African-American community, and that\u2019s what I wanted to do. Enough with the rallies of 25,000 and 35,000 people. This was very important to me. \nAnd I just met with some of the finest people I\u2019ve ever met back stage. We had a great meeting. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Grand Rapids, Michigan", "text": "And start believing in each other. We have to. Start believing in each other. And start believing in the greatness of our country. \nThere is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. Don\u2019t let anybody tell you it can\u2019t be done. The future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics, not the critics. \nHillary has been there for 30 years and she\u2019s accomplished nothing. She\u2019s just made things worse. \nShe\u2019s the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. We\u2019re the movement of the future. \nSome of the greatest political pundits of today, Bill O\u2019Reilly, many others said this is the single greatest political phenomena of their lifetime. It is. \nAnd folks, we don\u2019t want to throw it away. That\u2019s why we have to get out and vote Nov. 8th. \nOur movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life. \nWe are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters of which there are so many. \nWe are asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice, not money and power, should rule the day. \nWe are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors, not the special interests. \nWe are fighting to unlock the potential of every American and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a better day and a better future. \nWith your vote, we are just eight days away from the change you\u2019ve been waiting for for your entire life. \nTogether, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. \nThank you everybody. God bless you. Get out and vote, Michigan. Get out and vote, Nov. 8th. Thank you everybody. God bless you. \nAnd just in finishing up, in finishing up, just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. \nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. Hillary is increasing your taxes. \nWe will eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. \nWe\u2019re going to cancel every illegal Obama executive order. \nWe will rebuild our military. \nAnd we are going to take great care of our fantastic veterans. It\u2019s about time. 22 veterans a day commit suicide. Can you believe that number? 22 veterans a day are committing suicide. They wait in line for seven, eight, nine days when a simple prescription or a simple procedure could solve their problem. 22 veterans. These are our greatest people, committing suicide a day. \nIt\u2019s not going to be that way anymore. We\u2019re going to take care of our veterans. And I have tremendous veteran support. \nWe are going to totally support the men and women of law enforcement. \nWe will save the Second Amendment, which is under total siege. \nAnd we will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \nHillary wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can\u2019t change, and wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. \nI am asking you to dream big, dream big, to push for bold change, and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love of our country. \nI\u2019m tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day when they really mean another decade or many decades away. \nAmerica is tired of incompetence. America is tired of waiting. \nThe moment is now. All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians \nNow, she says, \u201cI\u2019m going to get rid of \u2013 \u201c She\u2019s going to get rid of ISIS. She has zero chance. \nISIS is dreaming about her becoming president. \nYou know, she\u2019s going to fix it. There was no ISIS when she was Secretary of State. She\nand Obama created it through the vacuum they created by stupidly the way they got out. \nEven Mosul. We\u2019re trying to retake Mosul for a second time because wee essentially gave it up. So now we\u2019re going in. \nDid we give them enough advanced notice? Four months is enough time. Right? \nGeneral, did we give Mosul enough advanced notice? I think so. Four months. \nAnd I keep saying, whatever happened to the element of surprise? The element of surprise. \nImagine if some of the money had been spent, $6 trillion in the Middle East, on building new schools and roads and bridges right here in Michigan. \nNow Hillary, trapped in her Washington bubble, that\u2019s blind to the lessons, wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with a nuclear armed Russia that could drag us into a World War III. \nOkay, folks. She \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you what. She will get us into World War III. She will get us into World war I. I will tell you that. She\u2019s incompetent. She will get us into World War III. \nThe arrogant political class never learns. They keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again. They keep telling the same lies. They keep producing the same failed results. \n How can Hillary manage this country when she can\u2019t even manage her emails? \nIt\u2019s just one disaster after another, one scandal after another, one betrayal after another. \nTo all Americans I say it is now time for new leadership. All of us. \nAnd you know what happened? They said Sunday evening, \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d You know when work started? Monday morning. \nI jokingly said to a friend of mine in China, \u201cHow long did it take you to get the environmental impact statement approved?\u201d He looked at me and go, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m kidding.\u201d \nSo they\u2019re building it. They\u2019re ripping it up with the biggest excavators you\u2019ve ever seen. And they\u2019re ripping it up and they\u2019re building it. They\u2019re not supposed to be doing it by the way. The only reason they\u2019re doing it is because they have no respect for our president, who\u2019s out campaigning all the time. \nThis guy ought to bring more time in bringing jobs back to Michigan and less time and less time fighting for somebody who\u2019s under criminal investigation, which he shouldn\u2019t be doing. \nWe\u2019ve received the first-ever endorsement from our I.C.E. and border patrol officers. \n16,500 border patrol officers. The first time they\u2019ve ever done it because they know we know what we\u2019re doing. \nThey tell us the border crisis is the worst it\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s a national emergency. \nThey also warn that America\u2019s plan under Hillary Clinton is the most radical proposal \u2014 quote, radical proposal in U.S. history. \nWhen I become president, we will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens. We have people in this country that are serious, serious criminals. \nAnd we will put America first. \nYou know, we have some very, very rough people, and we wanted to deport the people while she was Secretary of State. And they bring these people back to their countries and the countries very intelligently, they said, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t want a murderer. We don\u2019t want a drug dealer. We don\u2019t want the head of a gang in Los Angeles. We don\u2019t want them.\u201d They call up the Secretary of State\u2019s office. They said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s okay. Bring them back.\u201d \nSo we release them right into our country. How stupid are we? \nI promise you \u2014 it\u2019s well-known \u2014 I promise you, whether it\u2019s four years or eight years, we\u2019ll figure that out. There won\u2019t be one time \u2014 there won\u2019t be one time when any of these thugs come back into our country. Not one time. \nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. \nWe need a new foreign policy that puts America first, and we\u2019re going to have it very, very quickly. \nHillary led us to disaster in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya. \nThen after Benghazi, she looked the families of the fallen in the eye and lied. She blamed their deaths on a video, which was a lie. \nRemember when she back to Bosnia? Under fire, remember? Oh, it was under fire, it was so dangerous. Seriously. Under fire. Remember? But they had a video clip, she landed and these beautiful little girls were handing flowers. She came under fire \u2013 turned out not to be true. She apologized. She apologized. \nBut you have to ask her, the media \u2014 the most dishonest people, they have to ask her \u2014 they have to ask her \u2014 they have to ask her. \nThey have to ask her. So when Donna Brazile, who I told you just got fired, when Donna Brazile gave her the questions to the debate \u2014 ask this question to her, why didn\u2019t she report it? She accepted those questions. She accepted those questions to the debate. She had the questions to the debate. \nForget about Donna \u2014 I don\u2019t care about Donna Brazile. \nWhy didn\u2019t Hillary Clinton report that she was given essentially unethically, probably illegally, why didn\u2019t she report that she had the questions? \nHillary and our failed Washington establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it\u2019s worse than it\u2019s ever been before. \nHad Obama and others gone to the beach, Obama could have gone to the golf course, we would have been in much better shape. \nWe shouldn\u2019t have gone into the war, and she thinks I\u2019m a hawk. Oh, Donald Trump. We shouldn\u2019t have gone in. \nAnd we certainly shouldn\u2019t have gone out the way we got out because she created a vacuum ISIS formed. \nBut the ones that aren\u2019t are taken care of by the special interests and their donors. Because they want those companies to move because it\u2019s to their benefit. \nIt used to be that cars were made in Flint, and you couldn\u2019t drink the water in Mexico. Now the cars are made in Mexico and you can drink the water in Flint. Not good. \nBut we\u2019re going to turn it all around. And we\u2019re going to rebuild Flint. \nI was to Flint recently, and I\u2019ll tell you what. It\u2019s gone down a long way. \nAnd we\u2019re going to help you rebuild Detroit. \nAnd Mr. Gilbert has done a great job, by the way. Friend of mine. Done a great job. \nAnd we\u2019re going to rebuild Michigan. And we\u2019re going to keep your jobs and lots of other things. \nSo I\u2019d like to share a special message with the African-American community in Michigan, which has been so terribly harmed by the policies of the Clintons and a lot of the Democratic politicians. \nLook at the city of Detroit. Take a look. \nIt used to be the manufacturing hub of the world. Now nearly half of Detroit resident don\u2019t work. It has the second highest violent crime rate in the United States. And the children are trapped in failing, horrible government schools. \nYet as the people of Detroit suffer, Hillary wants to spend trillions of dollars on government benefits for illegal immigrants and refugees pouring into our country. \nI\u2019ve outlined a plan for urban renewal, which I believe so strongly in. It\u2019s called a New Deal for Black America. \nThat deal includes a plan to use the money we will save by securing our border and curbing refugee admissions to invest in communities, like Flint and Detroit. \nWe\u2019re going to bring in big number of jobs. Tremendous incentives. \nIt includes a pledge of school choice for African-American children. \nMy plan also includes a promise to cancel billions and billions of dollars in climate change spending for the United Nations.It\u2019s insane. A number that Hillary wants to actually increase. And instead use that money to provide for American infrastructure, including clean air and clean water. \nYou saw this recently. \nWe are going to spend billions and billions and billions of dollars for a plan where we don\u2019t even know where the money is going. \nAnd in the meantime, our companies won\u2019t even be able to compete because they\u2019re being regulated and restricted. They\u2019re not going to be able to compete. \nAnd I\u2019m an environmentalist. I will tell you. I\u2019ve received many environmental awards. \nBut I want clean air. I want crystal clean water. And I want safety. \nAnd we don\u2019t have to give hundreds of billions of dollars away to people that are probably laughing at us. They\u2019re not going to do it if you know where the money is going. Not going to happen. \nMy plan also includes a pledge to reduce violent crime. Every child in this nation has the right to grow up in safety and in peace. \nAnd my plan includes a pledge to restore manufacturing in the United States. We\u2019re going to start making things again. \nHillary and the Democratic Party have run the inner cities for years and only produced more poverty, more crime, worse education. \nThe time has come for real change. \nI\u2019m asking you for the honor of your vote so together we can turn decades of political failure into generations of lasting access for your children and your grandchildren. \nHillary, on the other hand, wants to destroy what\u2019s left of manufacturing in Michigan with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. By the way, a disaster. It\u2019s a disaster.  \nA Trump administration will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And by the way, we\u2019re going to have tremendous trade deals. \nWe are not going to have a deal that\u2019s 6,000 pages long, that ties in all of these countries together. You have to see a bar chart, lines all of the place. \nIf someone does something wrong that you can\u2019t do, we\u2019re going to have single lines going to single different countries. \nAnd if they don\u2019t do good by us, we send them what\u2019s called a letter of termination. 30 days. And during that 30 days, they\u2019ll call and we\u2019ll probably make a new deal that will be even better. [inaudible]\n \nIf you have to see this crazy Trans-Pacific Partnership, and they don\u2019t take care of monetary manipulation, which is the single biggest weapon that foreign countries use to kill us. Especially China, they\u2019re grand masters. \nWe will renegotiate NAFTA, and if we don\u2019t get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal. We\u2019ll make a much better deal. \nWe are going to lower taxes on American business from 35% to 15%. \nWe are going to massively cut taxes for the middle class. \nWe will unleash American energy, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. \nWe\u2019re going to put our miners back to work. \nThe Obama-Clinton war on coal is going to cost this state 50,000 jobs at least. \nAnd you have a war on your steel workers too, folks. Your steelworkers are suffering. \nWe will also work to restore and protect the Great Lakes. \nWe are going to become \u2013 we are going to become a rich nation again. \nBut to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation. \nHillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees pouring into this country. Hillary\u2019s immigration plans means generation of terrorism, extremism, and radicalism spreading into our schools, our communities, and every other place right here in Michigan and all throughout the United States. \nWhen we win, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program, and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. We have no choice. \nAnd we\u2019ll build safe havens for them in Syria. We\u2019re going to get the money from the Gulf States. They have plenty of money. They don\u2019t do their share. We\u2019ll get the money from the Gulf States. We\u2019ll lead the effort because we all have heart. We see what\u2019s happening. \nBut we can\u2019t do this. We don\u2019t want to be the great Trojan horse of the future. It\u2019s not going to happen to us, folks. You see what\u2019s happening in Germany? You see what\u2019s happening in Paris? \nPeople don\u2019t even go to Paris anymore. My friend used to go to Paris. \u201cOh, Donald, I love Paris. It\u2019s just so beautiful.\u201d For years. \nI said to him the other day, \u201cHow is Paris?\u201d He said, \u201cWe don\u2019t go there. Are you crazy? No.\u201d \nWe\u2019re not going to be the stupid people anymore, folks. We\u2019re going to be the smart people. \nA Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. \nAnd, yes, we will build a wall and you know that. \nWe received \u2014 so important.You have to have it. \nI don\u2019t know if you know, Hillary wanted a wall. Did you know that? And you know why they didn\u2019t build a big fence, wall? You know why they didn\u2019t build it? They couldn\u2019t get their environmental impact statements. \nCan you believe it? \nThe United States of America wants to put up a wall in \u201906, 2006. Hillary was in favor of it. They couldn\u2019t get approval to build the wall. Can you believe this? \nAnd then you see China in the middle of the South China Sea building a massive fortress.\n... \nAnd I\u2019ll have over $100 million in my campaign, which means, $100 million of people that aren\u2019t giving me money . \nI will tell you this. On the Internet, people $61 average. $61. We\u2019re setting records. Setting records. It\u2019s amazing. \nHillary got rich selling your jobs to the same special interests who pushed the jobs out of America are the people who have given countless millions to her. She\u2019s not going to change. \nHillary gets rich making America poor. Look at the devastation here. \nDelphi laid off 3,627 workers. You know that. And you know where they moved. Different places. Most of those jobs went to Mexico. And by the way Mexico is doing very well. If she\u2019s working for Mexico then I think she\u2019s doing a great job. \nWe\u2019re going to fight for the workers at Delphi. Anyone hear from Delphi? Delphi? A few. They don\u2019t want to raise your hands. This guy here had his hand partially up but he was like, \u201cNah no\u201d. In other words, don\u2019t worry you\u2019ll be proud of it real soon. They got a raw deal and they deserve better. \nGM laid off 314 workers at the Lake Orion Assembly plant in 2013 because of the imports from the South Korean trade deals that were pushed by Hillary. That was her baby. \nLear Corporation laid off many people in Rochester Hills and move their jobs to South Korea. \nFTE Automotive laid off 166 people in Auburn Hills \u2013 a place I know well. Their jobs went to Mexico. \nChrysler laid off 5,300 workers. Those jobs went to Mexico, China, and India and numerous other countries. \nFord laid off 2,155 workers. Their small car division is out. They\u2019re gone. They\u2019ve moved to Mexico. \nNow, Ford is moving a lot of different production facilities to a lot of different areas. But when you look at what\u2019s going on in our country, we want them here. \nA Trump administration will stop the stop the flight of American jobs. \nIf Ford or another company announces they want to move their jobs over to Mexico or to another country, then I will pick up the phone, and if I have to I\u2019ll do it personally even though some people will say it\u2019s unpresidential. Do I care? \u201cIt\u2019s not presidential, sir.\u201d \nBut I have some of those greatest business leaders \u2013 Carl Icahn. We have some of the greatest business people in the world endorsing me. They will do unbelievably well, believe me. \nAnd we will use our great business people. We have the greatest negotiators in the world. We don\u2019t use them. We use political hacks to make trade deals. \nOur trade with Mexico \u2013 NAFTA \u2013 is a defective deal. It was defective almost from the beginning because we have different tax systems.  \nThey\u2019re on a VAT system; we\u2019re on our own system. Well, there\u2019s a 17% \u2013 almost 17% difference. So every deal we make, we are behind 17% before we even start. \nPeople have known this for years and years and years, and it\u2019s a defective agreement. Nobody\u2019s ever changed it. Believe me. It\u2019s going to get changed very quickly. Okay? \nI will call the executives, and I will tell them that if they want to do that where they\u2019re taking their factories and they\u2019re taking their everything and they\u2019re moving it, and if they think they\u2019re going to sell their cars or their air conditioning units back into the country, we will charge them a 35% tax when they try to ship their products back across what will end up being an extremely strong border. \nAnd you know what? Just the fact that we\u2019re going to do that or we will do that, they\u2019ll never move. They\u2019re going to stay in Michigan. Nobody ever told them that. \nIf somebody went to them and said \u201d Look, please stay, please stay\u201d, you know, we\u2019ll do this and that, then they say \u201cNo, we\u2019re going to be leaving. We\u2019re going to Mexico.\u201d Then you say, \u201cAll right. Here\u2019s the story. No more Mr. Nice Guy.\u201d \nYou make your cars. You make your air conditioning \u2013 Indianapolis great place. 1,400 people have been laid off violently. I mean, people who worked there for 30 years. They laid them off. \nSo all I say is this, \u201cYou want to build your plant in Mexico? Have a great time. But if you think you\u2019re going to ship your products across the border, which will be a very strong border by the way, you think you\u2019re going to ship your stuff back across the border for no tax, no nothing so we end up with unemployment and we end up with empty plants and factories, and you end up with money, the jobs, and the plants. You can forget it.\u201d \nAnd you know what would happen if you said that right up front, nobody\u2019s leaving, folks. You stop it right away. \nThe politicians don\u2019t want to say that because most of them are too stupid to even understand it. \nBobby Knight: \nI want to \u2013 I want to ask you, all of you folks that have been \u2013 excuse me \u2013 in any branch of the military, male or female, or you have had sons, daughters, fathers, mothers, that have been in the military. Have many of you have done that, raise your hands? \nI want to tell you that there will be no president that has ever been closer or who has ever had greater respect for our military people than Donald Trump will have. \nThere\u2019s nothing more important in today\u2019s world than our military \u2013 Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, whatever \u2013 gets everything it needs to have, and this man will ensure that that is done. I guarantee you that. \nNow, you\u2019ve listened to him. You\u2019ve heard him talk. He has a couple more things to say. I\u2019m running out of things, but I\u2019m going to tell you one thing. In a Donald Trump administration, there will be no bullshit. Thank you very much. \nThank you. What a great place to be. Thank you, Bobby. \nAnd you know, we also have the endorsement of a great, great guy, Jack Nicklaus. Jack Nicklaus, you talk about winners. Jack is such a winner. Bobby is such a winner. \nWe have so many endorsements. We have so many endorsements from such great, great winners. We love Jack. \nAt the core of our contract is my plan to bring back your jobs. \nMichigan has lost more than 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA \u2013 a deal strongly supported by Hillary Clinton. \nBefore NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000, and believe me, it\u2019s going down and going down fast. \nOur country has lost, listen to this, 70,000 factories. 70,000, Bobby. Do you hear that? 70,000. I thought it was 700. I thought it was 7,000. \n70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization. Another Bill. That was another Bill and Hillary disaster. \nWe get nothing. He said what do we get? We get nothing. We get losses and unemployment. \nWe have nearly $800 billion in annual trade deficits with the world. $800 billion. \nWe do all this trade. We have a trade deficit of $800 billion. \nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. And the people of Michigan, perhaps, almost more than any other place know that. \nOur trade deficit with China grew by almost 40% during Hillary\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State. It\u2019s massive. \nHer trade deal with South Korea, you know all about that one, she was pushing it so hard. Instead of making 100,000, it killed 100,000 American jobs. \nSo when you look around Michigan, and you see the rusted out factories, the empty buildings and the long unemployment lines. Remember, Hillary Clinton did much of this to you. She wasn\u2019t there. \nAnd during the debates, you watched the debates, did I win the debates, by the way? Oh, the debates. I love those debates. \nBut, you know, I watch when she\u2019d say, \u201cI\u2019m going to do this. I\u2019m going to do that.\u201d And I\u2019d say, Hillary, you\u2019ve been there for 30 years, why didn\u2019t you do it? She\u2019d say, \u201cI\u2019m going to change the tax code so that Donald Trump can\u2019t do that.\u201d Well, what she doesn\u2019t say is that all of her donors are doing the same thing. \nBut I said to her, I don\u2019t mind if you do that. Then change the code, why don\u2019t you do it? Nothing gets done. The reason she\u2019ll never do it is because her donors don\u2019t want it done, okay? \nAnd her election would mire our government and our country in a constitutional crisis that we cannot afford. \nFolks, we have to get back to work. We need to get back to work. We need to be going to work for the American people. \nWe can\u2019t do what Hillary would like to do, and that\u2019s become president. You can\u2019t take it. I can\u2019t take it. Nobody can take it. \nAnd by the way, we do not need four more years of Obama. That I can tell you right now. That I can tell you. \nFour more years of ISIS running wild. Four more years of no borders. Four more years of losing all your jobs. Four more years of a depleted military.  \nWe\u2019re not building up our military for the great people in our military. \nHillary \u2013 well, that\u2019s right. \nHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption \u2013 eight days, you\u2019re right \u2013 is a threat to democracy. \nAnd the only way to save our democracy is to get out and vote by the millions. By the millions. Don\u2019t leave it to chance. \nWe\u2019re all hearing about our system is so honorable. It\u2019s so honest. The booth, right? They say it\u2019s so honest. It\u2019s so honest. You can name 10 places, so can I. But you hear so much about the honesty. \nLet\u2019s do this. Let\u2019s not worry about it. Get out and vote by the millions, and we won\u2019t have to worry about what\u2019s taking place behind the scenes. \nRemember this, 1.8 million people that are dead are registered to vote. \nYou know they talk about all, that\u2019s a threat to democracy what I\u2019m saying. 1.8 million people. \n2.75 million people are registered to vote in two states. So they vote here. They go to another state, they vote there. \nThere\u2019s so many things going on, folks. \nAnd Obama the other day, on television, talked about the bedrock of our foundation, and this is going to be. \nBut the other day, eight years ago, when he was running for the first time, he essentially was talking about how corrupt the election system is in Chicago. \nI saw it it. I said, wait a second, he\u2019s telling us how Trump shouldn\u2019t be saying these things. And this guy, eight years ago, is on television, last night, talking about how corrupt it is in Chicago, and saying, I\u2019m lucky I\u2019m from Chicago. In other words, it\u2019s corrupt. It\u2019s corrupt. He\u2019s lucky he\u2019s the beneficiary of the corruptness. \nFolks, get out and vote by the millions so they can\u2019t do anything. We can\u2019t let them take it away. \nThe Clinton crime spree ends on Nov. 8th. It\u2019s going to end on Nov. 8th. \nAnd when we close the chapter on the Clintons, we open a bright new chapter focused on the American people. \nSo we want to now be a little uplifting, because you know what? We have such tremendous potential. Tremendous potential in our country. \nMy contract with the American voter begins with a plan to restore honesty and accountability in our government. \nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words, we are about to say. Get ready. \nWhen we win on Nov. 8th, we are going to Washington D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. We\u2019re going to drain the swamp. \nAnd speaking of draining the swamp, Donna Brazile did it again, WikiLeaks today. She gave the questions to a debate to Hillary Clinton, and that was from a couple of weeks ago. Happened again, but this time far worse. She gave the questions to a debate to Hillary Clinton. Now, they\u2019re all blaming Donna Brazile, and frankly, I think she just got fired from the network. She should be fired from the DNC. \nBy the way, could you imagine if I did that? \nBobby, what would happen to me if I did that? \nElectric chair, I think. The electric chair. If I did that, can you imagine? \nSo Donna Brazile got fired from the network. But here\u2019s the real problem. Uh oh.  \nVery, very deep investigations. \nHillary is the one who sent and received classified information on an insecure server, putting the safety of the American people under threat. That\u2019s what she did. \n650,000. You know what I call that? That\u2019s the mother load. \nI think you\u2019re going to find the 33,000 that are missing, the 15,000 that are missing, the batch that are missing two weeks ago. You know, they had boxes of emails missing two weeks ago. \nI think we hit the mother load, as they say in the good old mining industry. \nHillary is the one who lied to Congress under oath. Hillary is the one who lied on so many different occasions to the FBI, and they know, they know. \nThey know Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. \nHillary is the one who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after she got the subpoena. After. Before it\u2019s no good, but after? No, that\u2019s why something should have happened then but that\u2019s okay. \nHillary is the one who broke the law over and over and over again. \nWe can be sure that what is in those e-mails is absolutely devastating, and I think we\u2019re going to find out, by the way, for the first time. \nThank you, Huma. Thank you, Huma. Good job, Huma. \nThank you, Anthony Weiner. \nAnd you all saw the statements I made about him a year ago? You know, in New York we knew Weiner. And I made statements that were rough. Like how can she be allowed to live with this guy? How can she have access to this important information? And I was badly criticized, right? \nNow they are saying, \u201cUhh, Trump has good judgment, wow.\u201d \nGot good instincts. I\u2019ve good instincts. \nHillary is not the victim. The American people are the victims of this corrupt system in every way. \nAnd this is your one chance, right now, Nov. 8th, to change it. \nHillary is likely to be under investigation for a very long time. \nOne of her longtime supporters, a top Democratic pollster, good guy, smart guy, sharp guy, Doug Schoen, is now totally withdrawing his support. \nHe supported that family for years. He wrote in an article, he wrote in an article quote, \u201cI\u2019m a Democrat. I worked for Bill Clinton but I can\u2019t vote for Hillary.\u201d \nAnd this is so important, Schoen writes, \u201cI\u2019m now convinced that we will be facing the very real possibility of a constitutional crisis with many dimensions and deleterious \u2013 and we all know that \u2013 consequences should Secretary Clinton win the election.\u201d \nNow, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen so hopefully. If that happens, we did a bad job out here, folks. \nSchoen warns that if Hillary is elected, she would be under protracted criminal investigation and probably a criminal trial, I will say. So we\u2019d have a criminal trial for a sitting president. \nIn the meantime, Putin, who she likes to say bad things about, and all the other leaders, many of whom she says bad things about, then you wonder why the world hates us. But all of these people will sit back and they will laugh and they will smile. \nThe investigation will last for years. The trial would probably start. Nothing will get done. \nI can tell you that your cars will continue to leave Michigan. Your car production facilities, like the Ford facility, will continue to leave Michigan. \nNothing\u2019s going to get done. Our country will continue to suffer. \nShe\u2019s unfit and unqualified to be the president of the United States.  \nBut to bring back your jobs, we must also immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. \nWhat a disaster. It\u2019s just been announced that Michigan residents are gong to experience crushing, double-digit premium hikes. Congratulations. Congratulations. \nIn fact, the number is so high, I don\u2019t want to give it to you because I want you to have a good time today, okay? I don\u2019t want to ruin your day. I\u2019ll see you just sort of slump out of here. \nNow, by the way, any place more fun to be than a Trump rally? \nAnd, and honestly, the subject right now isn\u2019t so positive, because it\u2019s what is going on with the country, but we\u2019re going to make it so positive, okay? We\u2019re going to make it so positive. \nIn Minnesota where the premium, I mean you have to see what happens in Minnesota but the increase is over 60%. \nThe Democratic governor has said, and he\u2019s a big Democrat, the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. He took a little heat for that. \nHillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. In fact, much more expensive than ever before. She\u2019s going to double-down. \nIn all fairness, folks, based on what we\u2019re reading, in all fairness, I think right now she has bigger problems than Obamacare. \nThey may have gotten wise to the Clintons. Perhaps they finally got wise.  \nWell, thank you. I love you too. \nAnd I have to give the FBI credit. That was so bad what happened originally and it took guts for Director Comey to make the move that he made in light of the kind of opposition he had with them trying to protect her from criminal prosecution. You know that. \nIt took a lot of guts. I really disagreed with him. I was not his fan but I\u2019ll you what, what he did, he brought back his reputation. He brought it back. He\u2019s got to hang tough, \u2018cause there\u2019s a lot of people want him to do the wrong thing. What he did was the right thing. \nI\u2019m asking for your vote, so we can replace Obamacare and save the health care, and look, healthcare in this country is in such dire straights. We\u2019re going to save health care for every family in Michigan, for every family in our country. \nMuch less expensive. Much better health care. Repeal and replace. We have so many alternatives, so much better, so much less expensive. \nReal change also means restoring honesty to our government. \nAs you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton and discovered, and discovered, you heard this yesterday, it\u2019s hard to believe, and discovered another 650,000 emails. \nShe lied under oath. When she turned over all her work-related emails. Just one more lie out of so many. \nAnd you know, General [James] Cartwright, a four-star general, lied one time, and I think he did it actually for national security purposes. He lied one time. He may go to jail for five years. \nShe\u2019s lied so many times and the deletions. \nThis is the biggest scandal since Watergate. \nHillary wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles. But she has brought all of this on herself. \nHillary is the one who set up an illegal private email server in a closet to shield her criminal activity. \nHillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay for play scheme at the State department. \nNow there are five FBI probes into the Clinton Foundation and their pay for play activities. \nHe\u2019s something. Coach Knight. No games, right? With him, there\u2019s no games. \nThank you, Coach. Thank you, General. \nWhat a combination those two are, right? \nBoy, this is a great group. You know, we set this up about 24 hours ago because I hear we\u2019re doing great in Michigan. We\u2019re going to win Michigan. \nWe\u2019re doing great in every poll. I mean, we\u2019re doing amazing. We\u2019re winning in Ohio. We\u2019re winning in Iowa. We\u2019re winning in North Carolina. We\u2019re winning in Florida. We\u2019re winning big in Texas. \nYou know, they were saying Texas is setting new voting records. We\u2019re winning all over the place folks. This is going to be something special. \nIn eight days, we\u2019re going to win the great state of Michigan, and we are going to win back the White House. 100%. \nLet me start today by making a very important promise to you. \nWhen I win on Nov. 8th, I am going to bring your jobs back to America. \nYou know it better than anybody else in this country. The long nightmare of jobs leaving Michigan will be coming to a very rapid end. \nWe\u2019re going to make Michigan the economic envy of the entire world once again. Used to be the economic envy. \nThe political class in Washington has betrayed you. They\u2019ve uprooted your jobs, your communities, and they\u2019ve shipped your wealth all over the world to Mexico and all over. They put new skyscrapers up in Beijing while your factories in Michigan were crumbling. These were our politicians. \nI will end the theft of American prosperity. Believe me.  I will fight for every last Michigan job. You\u2019re going to have plenty of jobs. Get ready. Because, when we win, it\u2019s going to be America first. \nSo, you have to make sure you get in your absentee ballots and get out to the polls on Nov. 8th. You have to get those ballots in. \nAnybody send in the ballots? Anybody? All right, big thing: Nov. 8th. \nWe\u2019ll never have a chance to do this again. We\u2019ve created a movement. This is like a great movement that the whole world is talking about. And honestly, you\u2019ll never have this chance. \nIn four years, I don\u2019t care who it is that runs. You\u2019ll never have this chance, so you have to get out and vote. Vote with all of your heart. Vote with all of your soul. Because this is it. \nShow the whole world how much you love Michigan and how much you love America by voting, so that we take back our jobs and we rebuild our military, and we do so many other things including border. \nWe\u2019ve got to have a border. I\u2019m asking for your vote. We will build the wall. Do not worry about it. Do not worry. \nWe don\u2019t build the wall, Bobby Knight\u2019s going to be very angry at me, so we\u2019re going to build the wall. \nAnd you know what else? You know who\u2019s paying for the wall, right? 100%. They don\u2019t quite know that yet, but they\u2019re going to find out. \nNo, they\u2019re good. I met with the president of Mexico couple of months ago. He was great. The whole thing is going to work out, but we\u2019re going to have to have a wall. We have to stop the poison from flowing in. \nYou know the poison are the drugs. They\u2019re flowing in. They\u2019re poisoning your state. They\u2019re poisoning New Hampshire. \nNew Hampshire tells me and for a year and a half with New Hampshire, they\u2019ve been telling me stories, unbelievable. But every state. \nThe poison is pouring in and we\u2019re going to stop the drugs. We\u2019re going to stop those drugs fast. \nThen we\u2019re going to work on the people that are so badly addicted. We\u2019re going to get them better. \nI\u2019m asking for the vote of Republicans, Democrats, Independents and first-time voters who want great jobs, safe neighborhoods, and a government that works for the people. \nI\u2019m asking you, so importantly, to believe in America once again. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech after winning the Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware & Rhode Island primaries", "text": "Question:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWe don\u2019t look for the delegates on the numbers two, three, four, five ballots. \nAnd here\u2019s what I say, let\u2019s assume it did go beyond the first ballot. And let\u2019s assume Reince, who\u2019s a very good man, head of RNC, Reince Preibus, let\u2019s say, oh well, Trump was 12 short or 15 delegates short or 25 short but 500 more than Cruz and far more than that ahead of Kasich. \nSo you go to the second ballot. Now, Trump by that time will be 5 million votes because of California and the size of California and I think Indiana and other places, Trump by that time will be 5 million votes ahead of Cruz. We\u2019ll be much more than 5 million votes ahead of Kasich. I mean, Kasich should be \u2013 I called him \u2013 now I change it now to 1 in 46. I mean, how do you stay in the race? \nAnd I would have won Ohio had I not been given a dirty poll saying that Florida was tougher than I thought. I stayed in Florida two more days instead of going to Ohio. If I had spent two more days in Ohio, I would have won it. \nOkay, how do you pick a man on the second, third, or fourth ballot who has millions millions of votes \u2013 5, 6 million votes \u2013 less than Trump and I\u2019m the one that brought all these people into the party. That\u2019s why the Republican Party is up almost 70% from four years ago. \nAnd you know what\u2019s going to happen? Those people at a minimum are going to be very upset, very angry. But at a minimum, they\u2019re just not going to vote. Not going to vote. \nSo how do you do this? How do you say, \u201cOkay, Trump won by 5 million votes. Trump is 500, 600 delegates more than Cruz and much more than that having to do with Kasich. And he brought millions of people into the party and everybody is talking about the party \u2013 worldwide how hot the Republican Party is.\u201d \nYou know, some people used to say it\u2019s staid. \nThe Democrats are 35% down from four years ago. The Republicans are almost 70% up from four years. And that\u2019s an amazing...and that\u2019s not because of...believe me, that\u2019s not because of Kasich or Cruz. That\u2019s because of me. \nSo here\u2019s the thing: How do you say to them \u201cWe\u2019re going to choose a man that lost by 5 million votes and 500 delegates. We\u2019re going to take him because Trump was 14 delegates short of winning in the first ballot?\u201d \nI don\u2019t think you can do that. \nNow, with that being said, I intend to get enough delegates. But that\u2019s it. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nYou look at the kind of crime. You look at what\u2019s going on economically. We need borders. \nAnd by the way, I want people to come into our country. But I want them to come in legally. They have to come in through a process. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d get 5% of the vote. The only thing she\u2019s got going is the woman\u2019s card, and the beautiful thing is women don\u2019t like her. Okay? \nAnd look how well I did with women tonight. \nOkay. So ladies and gentlemen, thank you, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nThe single biggest \u2013 it is not global warming. President Obama said the biggest threat to our country is global warming. That\u2019s called give me a break. Okay? \nThe biggest threat to our country is nuclear and we cannot let Iran get a nuclear weapon. We\u2019re going to do something where we\u2019ll have a real partnership with China. \nYou know, we have a lot of power of China. China has re-built itself by making a fortune over us. \nChina has power \u2013 tremendous power over North Korea. \nWe have to be very vigilant on North Korea. We cannot let this guy go much further. And China should handle that problem. China can handle that problem very easily. They say they can\u2019t but they\u2019re toying with us. Okay? They\u2019re toying with us. \nWe have a lot of power \u2013 we\u2019re going to have a great relationship with China. We\u2019re going to have a great relationship with Putin and Russia. \nBut let me tell you, China has a lot of power over North Korea. A tremendous amount of power. They just refuse to use it and they refuse to talk about it and they\u2019re toying with us. \nAnd right now, they don\u2019t respect. They don\u2019t respect our president. And because of that, they\u2019re getting away with murder and this guy is getting away with murder. \nWhat\u2019s going to happen is \u2013 and something very important to me and to a lot of other people but very, very important to me \u2013 is nuclear weaponry. That is your single biggest threat in the world today. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nWell, remember this, okay, I saw it on all the cable stations and a lot of the networks and I read it in a lot of papers, I\u2019ve had 55,000 negative ads against me. When I ran in Florida, I had 14,000 negative ads \u2013 millions and millions of dollars \u2013 and I won in a landslide. I\u2019ve had negative ads all throughout and I\u2019ve won races in a landslide. \nYou know it, you report it. You all report it. I\u2019m not even \u2013 even Carl would agree to that. Right? I mean, landslides. \n...Now, largely the ads were false. A little truth to some of them perhaps. But I had 55,000 \u2013 $100 million and maybe even more negative ads. \nEven in New Hampshire. I mean, Jeb spent millions and millions of dollars on negative ads and I won New Hampshire in a landslide. \nNow, what\u2019s happening is most of these people that have been fighting me are gone, and when I\u2019m one on one with Hillary, she will be as I said easier to take down, much easier to beat than the people \u2013 many of the people \u2013 that I\u2019ve already beaten. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd so we\u2019ll be discussing and part of it is economics. I was asked the question recently by Wolf Blitzer on CNN and he talked about NATO. And I gave a great answer. I gave an answer that at first people didn\u2019t like and then they said, \u201cYou know what? Trump is right.\u201d Experts said. I said it\u2019s obsolete and too many people are getting a free ride because we\u2019re funding 72%, 73% of NATO. You know, 28 countries. And many of these countries are just taking advantage of the United States and you have to pay up because we don\u2019t have a country with $19 trillion in debt that can afford this anymore. You have to pay up. \nAnd part of what I\u2019m saying is people \u2013 we love our countries, we love our allies, but our allies can no longer be taken advantage of this country. This isn\u2019t 40 years ago and it\u2019s not 20 years ago. This is now. \nAnd we have to rebuild our infrastructure. We have to rebuild our country. We have get rid of ISIS and we have to get rid of them fast. Our military is totally depleted. We have to build it up. It\u2019s going to be the cheapest thing we can do. \nAnd a lot of great things are going to happen. We\u2019re going to make America great again. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd I have followed people for years and I have friends that are the most successful people in the world. Many of them are endorsing me. Carl Icahn, many of the great business people are endorsing me. \nYou have to have flexibility. You can\u2019t say \u201cThis is my doctrine. I will not move\u201d because the world changes. Countries change. Leaders change. Lots of things happen. So you can\u2019t say that. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd again, the ceiling was always so unfair because...I want to do it because it\u2019s so important. But the ceiling \u2013 they kept saying, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hit the 50%.\u201d Well, now they don\u2019t say that anymore. But how do you hit 50% when you have 16 people in the race? You can\u2019t do it. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nThe biggest problem that students have \u2013 they have a problem with debt but they go to a good college. They borrow right up to here and they\u2019re choking on debt. And they graduate, they work hard, and they good marks and then they can\u2019t get a job. \nI\u2019m going to bring jobs back to this country like you\u2019ve never seen. That\u2019s the biggest problem. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nLook, Hillary Clinton is funded by Wall Street, folks. I mean, she\u2019s going to get the nomination unless she gets herself indicted with respect to what\u2019s happening with the emails. Okay? \nYou know, what I don\u2019t understand \u2013 you look at what\u2019s happened to so many other people and they went through hell. Their lives have been destroyed for doing less than what Hillary Clinton did. What she did is an outrage. It\u2019s an absolute criminal outrage. \nAnd for her to be able to run as a Democrat, that\u2019s why maybe Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t finished. But the only way you can say that is if something happens to her. \nShe\u2019s being protected by the Democrats because what she did and I see it and whether I read about it in the papers or I watch it with experts \u2013 legal experts on television \u2013 virtually every single one of them said what she did is a criminal act and what she did is a very, very dangerous thing for our country. \nAnd yet, here she is running for president. So I think that Hillary Clinton, honestly, she\u2019s a flawed candidate and I think she\u2019s going to be easy to beat. I think she\u2019s going to be much easier to beat than most of the 16 people that I competed with just recently. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nSo look, I\u2019m not changing. You know, I went to the best schools. I\u2019m like a very smart person. I\u2019m going to represent our country with dignity and very well. \nBut I really don\u2019t want to change my personality. I think it got me here. \nSomebody said if you change and if you weren\u2019t that way then you wouldn\u2019t be maybe where you are right now. \nWe beat a lot of people. A lot of people are sitting back saying, \u201cWhat happened, darling? Why are we sitting here? We\u2019re watching television.\u201d \nDon\u2019t forget, when I announced, there were many favorites that were going to win. One of those people raised over $100 million in a PAC and a lot of money personally. Others had other big advantages \u2013 governors of major states, et cetera, et cetera. They were all going to do great. They were all going to do great. One after another after another and here we stand with big five victories over 60%. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nHer husband signed NAFTA which destroyed this country economically. I will tell you. You look at New York state, you look all over New England, you look at Pennsylvania, NAFTA was a disaster. Her husband signed it and it was a disaster for this country. \nHillary will be horrible \u2013 absolutely horrible \u2013 on economic development. She will be terrible on jobs. She knows nothing about jobs except for jobs for herself. \nAnd when it came to answering the phone, when it came to answering the phone at 3 a.m., she was sleeping. Okay? She wasn\u2019t \u2013 with Benghazi and all of the other problems, you look at what she did with Syria. You look at what she\u2019s done in so many different ways. \nShe will not be a good president. She doesn\u2019t have the strength. She doesn\u2019t have the stamina. \nI know about dealing with China. I\u2019ve made billions of dollars dealing with China. \nChina can be dealt with and you can get along with them but Hillary does not have the strength or the stamina to deal with China or other things. \nBut bottom line is one of the big problems our country has is problems with trade where you have China, Japan, Mexico, so many countries just ripping us left and right. The politicians cannot handle that problem. Two reasons. Number one, they don\u2019t have the competence to do it. Number two, most of them are paid off through campaign contributions so that they don\u2019t touch certain things that the people want touched. \nWhen people are making less money in real wages than they were 18 years ago, and then some people said \u201cWow, he had a big crowd\u201d, that\u2019s one of the big reasons. I mean, you have people making less money today as you know because you see every stat. Less money today than they made 18 years ago. And in some cases, they\u2019re working two jobs. So they\u2019re getting older and they\u2019re working harder. Shouldn\u2019t be that way. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \n...Including protecting our country because she will not be good with the military. She will not be good with protecting our country. And she\u2019s had her shot. And she also raised her hand when it came to Iraq and she shouldn\u2019t have voted. \nAnd if you remember, just take a look at the things that Bernie Sanders was saying about Hillary Clinton. He said she is not qualified to be president. But he said something else...what\u2019s qualified? I mean, you\u2019ve got to go out, you\u2019ve got to run, and you see what happens. But he said some things about her that was so incredible. Incredible. And so incredibly bad. There\u2019s a great level of hatred right there but he\u2019s been telling the truth. \nAnd I really mean it. I think Bernie Sanders should run as an independent. I think he\u2019d do great. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nChris can tell you that. Ben Carson can tell you that. Other people can tell you that. \nI\u2019m getting calls \u2013 Cory can tell you. Paul can tell you. We have \u2013 we\u2019re getting calls from people who I actually say, \u201cHow can you do this? How can you do it?\u201d And they have no problem. But the fact is names that you wouldn\u2019t believe \u2013 names that you interview and say, \u201cOh, Trump, Trump, Trump\u201d and now they\u2019re calling to \u2013 they want to join the team. \nSo when you think of it and the really unfair thing that the pundits never report, when I began the process had 17 people. Very capable people. Like Chris \u2013 governors, senators, Dr. Ben Carson, very smart, tough, highly accomplished people. 17 \u2013 a record in the history of politics. 17 people. \nSo I go and I start winning, and I\u2019ll win New Hampshire, and I\u2019ll get whatever it may be \u2013 32% \u2013 and people would say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he get 50%?\u201d I said you can\u2019t get 50% when you have 16 people. \nThen I go to South Carolina; we have a massive victory. That was Cruz\u2019s stronghold except I won it in a landslide and I won it because of the evangelicals who backed me. The evangelicals have been unbelievable and they backed me. So I won there. And we had 12 or 13 or 14 people. We had many, many people, and I got a lot. \nAnd then we went to Nevada. We went to the south. I mean, Alabama with all of the people that we had, we almost got 50%. Massachusetts with all of the people that we had, we almost got 50%. \nThe pundits \u2013 I was watching tonight \u2013 the pundits never talk about the fact that these early states \u2013 even now we have three. Three is unfair. You know, Hillary has one. I have three. There\u2019s a big difference between fighting one person and fighting two people in terms of percentages. \nSo, what I\u2019m saying is when you talk about the 1,237 number, the first 70% of these things, we had from 16 people and even 17 people to 10 to 8 to 6 to 5 to 4 and now we\u2019re at 3. \nSo it\u2019s really unfair when you try and \u2013 you know, I\u2019m always been very good at math. Nobody ever discusses. When I watch the people on television, whether it\u2019s CNN, Fox, or any of them, and I watch, they never talk about the fact that we have all these people and that if you got a 32% or a 35% or 38% and you have 7 people running, that\u2019s an unbelievable \u2013 that\u2019s like a 75%. \nSo we are really honored by this night. And I am really honored to have hit over 60% in virtually every race with three people in the race... \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nIn fact, I heard that he had a news conference tonight and I heard the news conference was for the purpose that he\u2019s getting out of the race. That\u2019s what I thought. And instead, he just had a news conference. More talk. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nYou know, if you have a football team and you\u2019re winning, and then you get to the Super Bowl, you don\u2019t change your quarterback. Right? So I\u2019m not changing. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nYou know, when I speak to a group of 10 people in a conference, I\u2019m not going to be speaking the same way I spoke in Pennsylvania yesterday to 25,000 people. It\u2019s a very different thing. But I\u2019ll be saying very similar things. \nAnd you know what\u2019s going to happen? When we do that, all of a sudden, companies are going to say, \u201cI\u2019m staying in Syracuse, I\u2019m staying in Pennsylvania, and I\u2019m staying in Maryland.\u201d \nAnd I want to thank the people of Maryland. They\u2019ve been so incredible. We had some rallies all over but we had some rallies in Maryland and Pennsylvania that were absolutely unbelievable. \nYesterday, in Pennsylvania we were in an arena that was like Madison Square Garden. They turned away thousands and thousands of people. Unfortunately, the press never reports that. They always show my face. They go like this. I said, \u201cDoes anybody ever want to show this arena that\u2019s got tens of thousands of people in it?\u201d But they don\u2019t do that. But that\u2019s okay because I\u2019ll let the news explain it to you. \nBut we\u2019re going to have our country back. We\u2019re going to make America great again. \nAnd I just want to tell you for the five states, I am so honored. This was to me our biggest night because it shows such diversity. \nSo thank you very much, and we will take some questions. \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nNow, I\u2019m not saying everybody \u2013 some people have gone too far over the edge. But we will have people backing the party and backing the presidency, and we\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to beat Hillary Clinton, and it\u2019s not even...[inaudible]\n \nQuestion:\n[Inaudible]\n \nAnd one of the things with Pennsylvania. You know, we had a massive victory. 60% \u2013 above 60%. Pennsylvania is amazing. We get 17 delegates outright, and then you have 54 or so delegates that are, you know, up for grabs. The one thing different with Pennsylvania and I\u2019ve heard about it for years actually is that the winner of Pennsylvania, there\u2019s a moral obligation at least on the first round to support the person that won. Now, we didn\u2019t only win, we won big. And again we have to get in mind \u2013 you have the three people and when you have three people to get 60%, that\u2019s almost unheard of. Honestly, if you had two people and you got 60%, that\u2019s a really big victory. \nSo here you have a case where we have a great leader \u2013 a great Republican leader \u2013 and you have a moral obligation in Pennsylvania that those people \u2013 and all I care about is the first round. \nYou know, when you people write about Cruz is going around giving people dinner, buying people everything, riding them around all over the place, getting them into hotel rooms because he\u2019s looking for the second and third and the fourth, I\u2019m not really too interested in that because we\u2019re going to win on the first. I\u2019m not looking to go second, third, fourth. Maybe I\u2019m making a mistake. \nThe truth is even if this did ever go there, can you imagine if Donald Trump \u2013 because in California, we\u2019re up to almost 50%, I think we hit 50% today \u2013 and they\u2019re at 18% and 16% so we\u2019re going to have a big California. \nI think we\u2019re going to do great in Indiana. Indiana is the home of Carrier Air Conditioning, which is leaving for Mexico that I\u2019ve been talking about for the last four months \u2013 long before I knew Indiana would be so important. And I\u2019m saying that won\u2019t happen if I\u2019m president. Carrier will not be leaving Indiana if I\u2019m president. But I\u2019ve been talking about this for a long period of time. \nSo now he\u2019s 1 in 46. Why is he here? \nI can tell you that if you look, Dr. Ben Carson did much better. He could have hung around and done very well. \nIf you look, Chris Christie did much better. If you look, Marco Rubio did much better. In fact, Marco Rubio right now has more delegates than, you know, Kasich. I mean, he\u2019s got more delegates. But so many others \u2013 all they had to do was hang around. But they thought that was inappropriate and a lot of people don\u2019t like seeing it. It\u2019s like a spoiled person that just says, \u201cI\u2019m just staying\u201d for whatever reason. \nSo, Kasich \u2013 and by the way, as soon as Kasich gets hit with the first negative ad, he\u2019s had none, bing! That\u2019s the end of that. You know, it\u2019s the only thing he can say. \nAnd today, we came up even against Hillary but we will beat Hillary so easily. \nAnd you know, remember this: I was not going to run according to everybody and I ran. I was not going to sign form A, which basically you sign your life away, and I signed form A. And then everybody starts saying, \u201cWow.\u201d And then we put in financials and the financials were phenomenal \u2013 a little bit like this evening \u2013 far better than even people thought. Great financials. I built a great company with the help of my sons and my daughters. I mean, with the help of my family, frankly, and it\u2019s been great. \nBut we\u2019ve built a great, great company. \nAnd then everybody said again, \u201cWell, he\u2019s just going to have a good time for a couple of weeks. He\u2019s enjoying it.\u201d And very shortly, we went to number one over a three or four week period and we\u2019ve been there ever since. We\u2019ve been number one ever since. \nAnd again, millions of more votes, hundreds of more delegates. \nAnd I think this one is maybe the biggest of them all and in New York last week at almost 62% was incredible \u2013 far better than what people thought. \nThey said if you can break 50% \u2013 again with three people it\u2019s very hard to break 50% \u2013 we had almost 62%. Picked up so many delegates. \nLast week, we had 95 delegates in New York state, New York City. The whole thing added up to 95. We picked up almost every single one of them. It was an amazing victory. \nBut this one\u2019s a diverse victory. I mean, you go Rhode Island, then you go Maryland, then you go Connecticut, and you go Pennsylvania, and you go \u2013 I mean, the whole thing \u2013 Delaware. And every one of them was conclusive and every state is so different. I mean, it\u2019s so different. \nI think one of the greats was when you look at almost 50% in Massachusetts and almost 50% in the state of Alabama. Now, that\u2019s pretty different and we have all across the board. \nAnd I think we\u2019re going to do really well in Washington state and I think we\u2019re going to do amazingly well in Oregon and every place we\u2019re going to. \nI mean, we\u2019re going to be going \u2013 fighting hard \u2013 New Mexico. We\u2019re going to be fighting really hard. \nAnd I think that Gov. Kasich and Sen. Cruz have really, really hurt themselves with a faulty deal that was defaulted on before they even started... \nSo what it is is politicians \u2013 all talk, no action. They can\u2019t get it done. And they certainly can\u2019t straighten out our country because we\u2019re going to bring back jobs. We\u2019re going to take care of our military. We\u2019re going to be doing so many things.  \nI mean, for me, especially over the last two weeks because I traveled New York state and I went to Syracuse and Poughkeepsie and Rome \u2013 this Rome, our Rome. Rome, New York as opposed to \u2013 there\u2019s another Rome out there some place. But we went to Rome, New York. And we went to the island \u2013 Bethpage. \nJust every place we went \u2013 manufacturing down 40% to 45% and even more. \nAnd then we go to Pennsylvania and we see the same thing. You look at what\u2019s happening with steel. You look at what\u2019s happening in so many other industries. \nAnd I get statisticians to give me the numbers before I leave all the time. Give me the numbers. And every single place I go is a disaster. \nManufacturing down 40%, 45%, 55%, 60% sometimes in a relatively short period of time. \nOur jobs are being sucked away from our country and we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore, folks. We\u2019re going to make it very, very difficult to do that. \nAnd when companies want to leave this country, our great country, and they want to lay off all these people that in many cases helped build the country, there will be consequences for that company to pay when they think they\u2019re going to make their product and send it in no taxes through a very weak border \u2013 which by the way, our border will be very, very strong, and we will build the wall. Just remember I said it. Okay? \nBut when they think they\u2019re going to send their product right through this weak border and they\u2019re going to pay no tax and have absolutely no consequence for what they did, it\u2019s not going to happen that way. \n...Said, \u201cHow are you going to pivot out of this statement?\u201d They said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d In other words, they\u2019re politicians. They can do it. \nBut I just want to thank everybody. This is a far bigger win than we even expected. All five. \nAnd that\u2019s something \u2013 that\u2019s really \u2013 and not only it is all five but it\u2019s all five whether it\u2019s 60% or just about 60%. Even I see one up there that\u2019s 66% and 67%. \nAnd you have to remember and I say this all the time to the pundits \u2013 I love the pundits \u2013 but I say it all the time \u2013 there are three people. When you crack 60% as we did last week with our great city and our great state of New York, when you crack 60% with three people, that\u2019s very hard to do. \nIn fact, I think Chris can tell you if you\u2019ve cracked 60% with two people, that\u2019s called a massive landslide. But we have three. \nAnd you know, some strange things have happened. Last night, it was very strange when I watched this group get together. It was a strange moment. I got a call at 11 p.m. and we talked and I said, \u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing because it shows weakness. It shows ineffectiveness. It shows failing campaign. But really it\u2019s collusion.\u201d In business, they put you in jail for collusion. In politics, you\u2019re allowed to get away with it. \nBut it really is \u2013 I thought it was a very weak signal and the Republican Party needs something much different than that. \nWe\u2019ll be going to...Indiana. I\u2019ll be leaving tomorrow afternoon for just a long stay. It\u2019s a great state. I have many, many friends there. \nAnd I have a coach \u2013 Bobby Knight. The great Bobby Knight...Bobby\u2019s an amazing guy. He\u2019s tough. He\u2019s sharp. He\u2019s smart. And he wins. He knows how to win. And the people of Indiana love him and Bobby\u2019s endorsed me. And we\u2019re going to spend tomorrow night and I think the next day with Bobby. So it\u2019s going to be a lot of excitement and fun and that\u2019s call the gold standard. For Indiana, I think Bobby Knight has to be the gold standard. \nAnd we have so many other people that have endorsed us there so that will be great. So we\u2019ll be spending \u2013 we\u2019ll start in the afternoon and we\u2019ll be spending numerous days in Indiana and it\u2019s going to be something really, really special. \nSo, I want to thank the media. The media has covered me very fair for the last two hours. No, they\u2019ve been very fair over the last few weeks. \nAnd you know, it\u2019s been amazing what\u2019s been happening. The crowds that we\u2019ve had are record-setting crowds. Bigger than Bernie. But Bernie\u2019s second, I have to say. \nIn fact, I suggested today \u2013 you probably saw that \u2013 the Democrats have treated Bernie very badly and frankly I think he should run as an independent. Okay? I actually \u2013 I think they\u2019ve treated him very badly. \nI mean, you know, the system is a bad system, and whether it\u2019s their system or our system, you look at what goes on. But the best way to beat the system is have evenings like this where you get record-setting votes, where you get record-setting delegates. \nI used the analogy of the boxer. You know, when the boxer knocks out the other boxer, you don\u2019t have to wait around for a decision. So that\u2019s what it is. \nThat\u2019s what happened tonight. That\u2019s what happened last week in New York. And that\u2019s really what\u2019s been happening throughout. \nWe have millions more votes \u2013 millions more \u2013 than Cruz. We have millions more votes than Kasich. I mean, Kasich now I guess he was 1 in 41.

I\u2019ve evolved on many issues over the years and you know who else has? Ronald Reagan evolved on many issues. \nI am pro-life. And if you look at the question, I was in business. They asked me a question as to pro-life or choice, and I said \u2013 if you let it run \u2013 that I hate the concept of abortion. I hate the concept of abortion. \nAnd then since then I\u2019ve very much evolved. \nAnd what happened is friends of mine years ago were going to have a child and it was going to be aborted and it wasn\u2019t aborted and that child today is a total super star \u2013 a great, great child. \nAnd I saw that and I saw other instances and I am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life. \nAs far as being a Republican is concerned, I come from a place \u2013 New York City \u2013 which is virtually, I mean, it\u2019s almost exclusively Democrat. \nAnd I have really started to see some of the negatives \u2013 as an example and I have a lot of liking for this man but the last number of months of his brother\u2019s administration were a catastrophe and unfortunately those few months gave us President Obama and you can\u2019t be happy about that.

You know she was down on Palm Beach. \nI moved on her and I failed. I\u2019ll admit it. \nI did try and fuck her. She was married. \nNo, no, Nancy. No this was \u2013 and I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. \nShe wanted to get some furniture. I said I\u2019ll show you where they have some nice furniture. \nI took her out furniture. I moved on her like a bitch. But I couldn\u2019t get there, and she was married. \nThen all of a sudden I see her. She\u2019s now got the big phony tits and everything. She\u2019s totally changed her look. \nLook at you. You are a pussy. \nMaybe it\u2019s a different one. \nYeah, that\u2019s her.

Sorry. \nSupport the men and women of law enforcement, we have to. \nAnd we\u2019re going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \nWe will rebuild our roads, our bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools, and hospitals. \nAmerican cars will travel the roads. American cars will soar in the skies. And American ships that we make \u2013 that we make \u2013 will patrol the seas. \nPennsylvania steel with build this country like it built the Empire State Building many years ago. \nAnd Pennsylvania steel and the incredible steel workers will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. \nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation, and American energy, mined by our miners and other American sources, including right here in Pennsylvania, so important, will power our nation. \nAmerican workers will be hired to do the job, and we will start making things again and we will start winning again. \nWe will put new Pennsylvania steel into the spine of this country. I will fight for every neglected part of our nation, and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans. \nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God saluting one American flag. \nOn Nov. 8th, a new bright dawn begins for our country. Pennsylvania, you have no idea the importance. \nCrooked Hillary is spending tens of millions of dollars on Wall Street money running commercials about me that are false. \nWell, they\u2019re mostly false, yeah, a little truth every once in a while. \nSo many commercials. A friend of mine called up. He said \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else but those commercials. They\u2019re driving me crazy. And Donald it\u2019s not you.\u201d That\u2019s true, it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s not me. \nBut she\u2019s spending tens of millions of dollars. It\u2019s a disgrace. \nAnd much of those commercials, I will tell you, is false. \nSo we\u2019re going to do something that, I think, the country has never seen before. This movement is special. The people are special. \nWe are going to make America wealthy again. We are going to make America strong again. We are going to make America powerful again. We are going to make America safe again. \nAnd we are going to make America great again. \nThank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. God bless you, everybody. Thank you. Get out and vote. God bless you. \nHillary Clinton is there for only one reason \u2013 to protect those special interest and those donors and her own money. \nOur campaign is taking on big business, big media, and big donors. \nWe know how to do it. You know how you do it? With massive rallies like this. They can\u2019t compete with us. They can\u2019t. \nMy campaign is powered by my money. My money and by small dollar donations from hard working patriots like all of you. Every dollar brings us closer to taking our country back. \nAnd we\u2019ve raised a tremendous amount of money. The day after the debate, $18 million came in to our coffers. Think of that. $18 [million]. That was our all time record. \nI guess they thought I did good in the debate but we got tremendous money came in. And we\u2019re raising tremendous money in $61 numbers \nBecause all of you and all of our great volunteers across Pennsylvania, some of which are here tonight, standing right in the front row, we\u2019ve knocked on over 100,000 doors in the state of Pennsylvania, and believe me, those people like us knocking on their doors. Over 100,000 doors they\u2019ve knocked on. Raise your hands, those people that are working with us. Raise. They\u2019ve been unbelievable. Thank you, man. Unbelievable. We\u2019re going to have a big victory. \nYou have 38 days until the election. 38 days to change the future of our country and the world. You have 38 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true. \nDo not let this opportunity slip away or be wasted. You will never, ever have this chance again. Not going to happen again. \nIn four years, you\u2019re not going to be able to do it. \nYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman, and child in this nation. \nThe arrogance of Washington D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. Watch. \nIt happened in Europe, Brexit, and it\u2019s going to continue to happen. \nAnd I predicted Brexit. Remember, I predicted. Everybody said, \u201cWhat does Trump know?\u201d but I have a lot of things over there, and I said, \u201cYou know what? There\u2019s a bad feeling going on here\u201d. And I predicted Brexit, and everybody said, \u201cHe\u2019s crazy! What does he know.\u201d Then after I turned out to be right, nobody said I predicted it. \nOn Nov. 8th, we\u2019re going to show the whole world that America is back \u2013 bigger and better and stronger than ever before. \nAnd just to finish up, here\u2019s just a few of the great things that will happen for your country. \nYou are going to see your taxes substantially lowered. She wants to raise your taxes. Tremendous tax decrease. \nWe\u2019re going to eliminate every unnecessary regulation. She wants to increase regulations. \nWe want to repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare. \nWe want to make child care more affordable. My daughter, Ivanka is so strong and she\u2019s going to be here next week to speak. \nWe\u2019re going to end Common Core. We\u2019re going to provide school choice to every low-income child in America \u2013 African-American children, Hispanic children. We\u2019re going to get great education for people that will never get it under our system. \nWe\u2019re going to end illegal immigration. We\u2019re going to have a strong border. \nOh! By the way, people are going to come into our country but they\u2019re going to come into our country legally. Legally. \nWe\u2019re going to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Hillary wants to let them come pouring in. We can\u2019t do that, sorry. \nWe\u2019re going to save the Second Amendment, which is under siege. \nAnd another one that endorsed me is The National Rifle Association, the NRA. Wow. They\u2019ll be happy to see that. They\u2019re going to be happy to see that. They\u2019re incredible people and they love the country. \nRemember those families. \nSo we\u2019re going to deal with trade. We\u2019re going to deal with disastrous trade deals like NAFTA that have crushed industry in Pennsylvania. We\u2019re going to renegotiate that. Going to make them great deals or we\u2019re going to terminate them. Start all over. \nWe will come out so far ahead. We lost so much money, so many jobs. \nYour state has lost more than one in three manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was enacted, a Bill Clinton signed deal supported heavily by crooked Hillary Clinton. \nJobs are moving to Mexico including 300 jobs that left in recent years from the Hershey plant. \nYou\u2019ve lost one in four manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another deal pushed by Bill and supported by Hillary. \nHillary Clinton is merely a vessel for those global special interests trying to strip our country of its wealth, its jobs, its status as a sovereign nation. \nAnd we have been stripped. Folks, we don\u2019t make anything anymore. We don\u2019t make anything. We\u2019re going to start making things. \nWe\u2019re not going to let countries like China devalue their currency and have trade deficits of $400 and $500 billion a year. We\u2019re not going to let that happen. \nShe\u2019s a globalist who makes a living taking jobs from our country and giving them to foreign countries. Now, she\u2019s not going to tell you that but that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. \nI\u2019m not running to be president of the world. I\u2019m running to be president of the United States of America and represent you. \nHave you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seemed to happen? \nWhen was the last time we had a victory? Think of it. A massive company coming into town. When was the last time? \nYou don\u2019t have victories. We can\u2019t defeat ISIS. And by the way. By the way, just so you know. Our military is depleted. We\u2019re going to build up our military. We are going to knock the hell out of ISIS. \nIt\u2019s because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don\u2019t want these changes to happen. \nI am an agent of change. We\u2019re going to make great change for our country. \nHillary Clinton\u2019s been there for 30 years. \nAnd you know, when I was up on the stage, on Monday night, I said to myself \u2013 it was sort of strange. All these people. I figured like a 100 million people, right? I had a bad mic. I\u2019m thinking about all this and all of a sudden it comes to me. It\u2019s like a moment of clarity. More than any other time. \nShe says, \u201cI\u2019m going to do this. I\u2019m going to do that. I\u2019m gonna...\u201d \nShe\u2019s been here for 30 years. Why hasn\u2019t she done it? She\u2019s not going to do anything. She\u2019s never done anything meaningful. Never. \nHer only legacy is death, tremendous financial loss, and failure. \nHer policies gave us the disasters in Iraq, in Libya and Syria. Her policies unleashed ISIS. \nNow remember, the way she got out of Iraq left a tremendous vacuum from which ISIS was formed. \nNow I said that \u2013 and this character, Lester Holt. I mean, take a look. You\u2019ve got to study that tape. He came at me every time. And I was right. \nWith her, when she said things that were wrong. He didn\u2019t come after her. \nAnd now she wants 550% increase in Syrian refugees to pour into our country. And she doesn\u2019t even say the words radical Islamic terrorism nor does President Obama. \nHer policies gave us that disastrous deal with Iran \u2013 one of the worst deals, one of the dumbest things I\u2019ve ever seen of any kind. \nAt home, look at how she failed upstate New York. She promised, just like she is now, jobs, jobs. She doesn\u2019t know the first thing about jobs. \nI\u2019ve created thousands and thousands of jobs. That\u2019s what I do. I create jobs. \nShe promised 200 000 jobs but instead more people left. And she failed \u2013 a tremendous failure. \nManufacturing jobs in upstate New York are down nearly 40% from the time she was elected. \nShe never does, and that\u2019s never going to change. \nMany of them will never forget her calling young African-American men \u201csuper predators.\u201d That\u2019s what she called them. \nTo the African-American community, let me ask you this one question: Are you better off than you were eight years ago? \nLook, for instance, at our inner cities. Look at what\u2019s going on. Look at what\u2019s going on. Massive levels of poverty, crime that\u2019s out of control, no education, no jobs, tremendous joblessness. People walk to the office, they walk to get a loaf of bread, they get shot. Their child gets shot. This has been going on for decades and decades. \nHillary Clinton and people that think like her \u2013 and I say this to the African American community, I say it to the Hispanic community \u2013 vote for Donald Trump. What the hell do you have to lose? What do you have to lose?  \nI will fix it. I will fix it. I\u2019ll bring jobs. I\u2019ll bring great education. I\u2019ll bring safe neighborhoods. \nIf you keep voting for the same people, you\u2019ll keep getting the same horrible results. \nTake a look at what\u2019s going on on the streets. Take a look at Charlotte. Take a look at Baltimore. Take a look at Ferguson. \nTake a look at what\u2019s happening out on the streets of our inner cities. Look at Chicago. Thousands and thousands of shootings, 3,000 shootings since Jan.1st.  That\u2019s not a long time ago. \nIt\u2019s worse than war zones. In many cases, you have cities, inner cities, that are worse than war zones and more dangerous than some war zones. \nA Trump administration will bring prosperity to all of our people. My economic agenda can be summed up in three such beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs! \nWe\u2019re going to massively reduce taxes for working and middle-class Americans. Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be immediately eliminated. We\u2019re going to create jobs. \nThe total catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced. \nWe will lift the restrictions on American energy, including clean coal and shale energy right here in Pennsylvania. \nAnd we will take care of our miners, which Hillary Clinton says she wants to put our mines and our miners out of business. She said that. She wants to put our mines and our miners out of business. Not going to happen, folks. \nShe also wants to shut down production of shale energy. Not going happen. \nWe\u2019re going to put the miners back to work. We\u2019re going to unleash the power of shale energy, adding another $50 billion to Pennsylvania\u2019s economy. \nWe\u2019re going to protect that over 5,000 farms in Lancaster, which I know very well. I was here so much. \nAnd by protection, that includes lower taxes, less regulation, better trade deals, and more affordable energies. \nHow many farmers do we have here in Lancaster? Raise your hand. Not that \u2013 Yeah but a lot of people are employed by those farms, right? \nThose farmers \u2013 are they rich people or are the regulations\u2013? He goes not so good. We\u2019re going to make it good for everybody. \nLet me pause briefly to discuss a very heartbreaking topic. \nAs most as you know, tomorrow is the 10th anniversary of the Nickel Mines school shooting. Tonight, when you say your prayers, I ask you to remember those five young beautiful girls and their families. \nAnother issue we\u2019re going to deal with is, in certain ways, so important. \nBut when I tell you about what I just did, that is a special group of people. So say prayers please, okay? \nJust remember those people and what they went through, and remember those families. \nAnd he was supposedly in Arizona \u2013 just happened to be playing golf. But I think it was 114 degrees that day. It\u2019s very hot. \nI love Arizona. One of my favorite places but it\u2019s very hard to play when the temperature goes over 100 degrees. Okay? So he was there to play golf. But nobody saw him play golf. Did anybody see him playing golf? \nHe just happen to be standing on the runway when this plane came by. \u201cOh, hi!\u201d \nHey, I\u2019ve had a plane for a long time and nobody\u2019s ever done that in years. \nDoes it happen that way? What a rigged system. \nAnd what\u2019s taking place is horrible. \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you \u2013 and I said before \u2013 this is all a great embarrassment to our great country. This is a great embarrassment. \nAnd people who have done 5% of what she did are suffering grave, grave consequences. You see what\u2019s happening to them. The mother crying because of the way they\u2019re treating her boy who did nothing by comparison and didn\u2019t mean to do it. \nYou see what\u2019s going on. General Petraeus. You see what happened to him -destroyed his life, destroyed his life. And it was a tiny, tiny piece compared to what she\u2019s done. \nThen she\u2019s taken 13 phones and they\u2019re missing and they were destroyed \u2013 many of them or some of them \u2013 with a hammer. \nForeign enemies with easy access were able to \u2013 I don\u2019t know if they did \u2013 hack her server. How about the server? How about the server put in the basement? \nLies to Congress under oath about turning over her work-related emails. \nHer staffers taking the Fifth Amendment. And her ring leaders getting immunity deals \u2013 five immunity deals. There\u2019s nobody left except her. Except her. \nShe hasn\u2019t got immunity yet. I wonder if Obama is going to give her immunity. Interesting. She hasn\u2019t gotten immunity yet. She\u2019s the only one. \nDid anybody ever see so many people get immunity? Everybody. You\u2019re guilty, you\u2019re guilty. We\u2019ll give everybody immunity \u2013 everyone. \nWhy do you need to investigate it if everyone\u2019s going to get immunity. Right? \nBut she hasn\u2019t gotten it yet. What are her chances of getting immunity from President Obama? It\u2019s going to be very interesting. It\u2019s going to be very interesting. \nClinton and her cronies will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to enrich themselves and keep their grip on power. \nThe American people have had it with years and decades of Clinton corruption and scandals. \nRemember, he got impeached for lying. You remember what he lied about. But he got impeached for lying. He can\u2019t practice law. Can\u2019t be a lawyer. He was a lawyer. Can\u2019t be a lawyer. Everyone forgets. \nWe want to take our country back, folks. We want to take our country back. \nLook at Whitewater. Look at the cattle deal she made. \nA friend of mine in the cattle business they said it\u2019s the single greatest deal there percentage wise. \nI mean, she made a percentage gain. I think it\u2019s got to be some kind of a record in the history of the cattle business. I guess she knows a lot about cattle. \nNow, it\u2019s a very serious thing. We have a very, very serious thing happening right now to our country. \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you who\u2019s leading it. These people back here all of those cameras, they\u2019re leading it because they\u2019re letting her get away with murder. They\u2019re protecting her. They\u2019re protecting her. \nSo we\u2019re tired of the lies, tired of the trivial politics, tired of being talked down to, look down upon, and treated like second class citizens. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore. \nThis will be the year the American people say enough is enough. Enough is enough. \nHillary Clinton has been a total disaster for so many communities, but especially so important, for the African-American communities. \nI don\u2019t think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton. They\u2019re too smart, and they know they\u2019ve been used for years and years and years. \nThey also know that she\u2019ll do nothing for them once the election\u2019s over. \nYou know, they say, \u201cOh, maybe you have a conflict.\u201d Yeah. If I do a great job as president, they\u2019ll probably be more valuable. Right? That\u2019s a conflict. But that\u2019s like a good conflict, isn\u2019t it? \nSo, we need proper thinking. Our country doesn\u2019t. \nCan you imagine somebody saying $400 million in cash or $1.7 billion in cash or 800 people and now 1,700 people for deportation now coming back as citizens, not legally \u2013 as citizens? \nHillary Clinton\u2019s only loyalty is to her financial contributors and to herself. \nI don\u2019t even think she\u2019s loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth. \nAnd really, folks. Really. Why should she be, right? Why should she be? \nThe large corporations who support terrible trade deals that ship your jobs to other countries, they are donating to crooked Hillary Clinton. \nThe Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class. And by the way, we have middle class. We have really rich people. We have people that aren\u2019t so rich. We have poor people. We have everybody here. We have highly educated people. \nI know two of them. And I mean. They are slightly, I said they\u2019re here. They have too much education. They would have done better with a little bit less. Oh he\u2019s angry at me and that\u2019s okay. \nBut we have everybody. But we have the most loyal people and everybody says it. We have the people that are going to get out and vote. We have the people no matter what happens they\u2019re out there with us because they know what we\u2019re doing is going to be so great for our country. \nThe wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy \u2013 and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing \u2013 they\u2019re giving to Hillary Clinton. You see it all the time. \nThe special interests who want to open borders, they\u2019re donating to Hillary Clinton. \nFollow the money. In her campaign for president, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds. \nNow look, here\u2019s a a person who\u2019s only worked for government essentially. Right? And now they\u2019re worth 2$50 million dollars, folks. \nNow it\u2019s not like they built a big project and they put a lot of people to work. \nThey say she\u2019s worth $200 to 250 million. Okay. Give me a break. How do you do that? How do you do that? She\u2019s worth $250 million. You know how that happened. She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office. \nThe same groups paying Bill and Hillary... for their speeches will now be the federal government. \nSo they\u2019re making speeches. They\u2019re getting paid. They\u2019re lobbying the government. That\u2019s nice. \n22 groups paid Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State. \n$250 million dollars. Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks. She put the Secretary of State up for sale. And if she ever got the chance she\u2019d put the Oval Office up for sale too. Believe me. \nShe deleted and bleached 33,000 e-mails after getting a congressional subpoena. \nSo here\u2019s the story, folks. If you\u2019re in a deal and Mr. Smith is suing you and they want your records and your e-mails and everything. And you say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t wanna give them.\u201d But you know, you have, a court order. That\u2019s just a court order. This isn\u2019t a congressional. It\u2019s a court order. You have to give them. \nAnd here\u2019s what happens if you don\u2019t give them, if you get rid of them \u2013 meaning delete them and do what she did \u2013 they put you in jail. You know, they put you in jail. \nShe got a congressional subpoena. I can\u2019t believe it. I talk about it. But the FBI doesn\u2019t do anything and the Justice Department doesn\u2019t do anything. \nAnd then Clinton, Bill, meets with the attorney general in her plane for 39 minutes. And he said they\u2019re talking about golf and their grandchildren. 39 minutes. \nI give two minutes to golf and two or three minutes to the grandchildren. \nIt\u2019s been it\u2019s been the worst probably ever made, not in this country, anywhere in the world. \nIt cleaned out New England. It cleaned out big portions of Pennsylvania. It cleaned out big portions of Ohio, and North Carolina, and South Carolina. You can\u2019t let it happen. \nAnd these bloodsuckers want it to happen. They\u2019re politicians that are getting taken care of by people that want it to happen. Other countries want it to happen because it\u2019s good for them, but it\u2019s not good for us. \nSo, hopefully, you\u2019re not going to let it happen. \nWhatever Hillary\u2019s donors want, they get. They own her. \nOn Nov. 8th, we\u2019re going to end Clinton corruption. \nHillary Clinton, dishonest person, is an insider fighting for herself and for her friends. \nI\u2019m an outsider fighting for you. \nAnd by the way, just in case you\u2019re not aware, I used to be an insider, but I thought this was the right thing to do. This is the right thing to do. Believe me. \nFor decades we\u2019ve talked about the corruption, incompetence, and failures of our leaders. \n2016, our long-awaited chance. It\u2019s going to be our long-awaited chance to bring about real change, not Obama change, but real change. \nAnd remember this: Hillary Clinton will be four more years of Barack Obama. And maybe worse. And actually maybe worse. \nWe can\u2019t let that happen. You\u2019re not going to have a country left. \nIf you do this one simple thing, you can deliver justice for every single person who has been wronged by the system. You have to show up and vote. \nWhen you cast that ballot, just picture a Wall Street board room filled with special interest, who\u2019ve been bleeding our country, who\u2019ve been bleeding Pennsylvania, who\u2019ve been taking your jobs. Take a look on their faces, and you will see smart people that know the game, but people that want to take your jobs and want to take your money. To them I say, \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d \nOh, I could be doing The Apprentice right now. I could be. Somehow\u2013and I loved it. 14 seasons. How good was that? Tremendous success. They wanted to extend. I could be doing The Apprentice now. Somehow I think this is a little bit more important, do we agree? Just a little bit? \nAnd to the millions of unemployed Americans, we\u2019re going to say the two words that I really love. You know what they are? You\u2019re hired! You are hired. \nI\u2019m not a politician. I have no special interest. My only loyalty, and I mean this, I didn\u2019t need to do this, folks, believe me. This is tough work. \nThis is a little bit like a lot of the people in this room, for 17, 18, and even 20 years, you had a better job 20 years ago than you have now. You got more money. Better job. \nNow you have a lot of years. You get less money. In many cases you\u2019re working two jobs and three jobs. So you\u2019re working harder, you\u2019re older, and you\u2019re making less money. Supposed to be the other way around. \nBut the only thing I can say to you is I\u2019m also working harder. This is hard work. \nWhen they told me outside, \u201cSir, your helicopter cannot land tonight. The weather is terrible.\u201d I said, \u201cHow many people are out there?\u201d They said, \u201cAt least 15,000.\u201d I said, \u201cAre you crazy? Land the helicopter.\u201d \nNo, there\u2019s no way we were going to miss it. And these are amazing people. We have amazing people in our country. I mean, we\u2019re going bring our country together everywhere. \nSo my only loyalty is to you. This is my loyalty. I don\u2019t care about my company at that point. My kids will run it. My executives will run it. \nWe built a great, great\u2013this is a great company. Some of the greatest real estate assets in the world. \nAnd she\u2019s being totally protected by The New York Times and The Washington Post and all of the media and CNN \u2013 Clinton News Network \u2013 which nobody is watching anyways. So what difference does it make? Don\u2019t even watch it. \nBut she\u2019s being protected by as many of these groups. \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s not like \u201cOh gee, do you think she\u2019s guilty.\u201d They\u2019ve actually admitted she\u2019s guilty, and then she lies and lies. 33,000 emails deleted, bleached, acid washed and then takes her phones and they hammer the hell out of them. \nHow many people have acid washed or bleached a Tweet? How many that you deleted? So you delete it but that\u2019s not good enough. \nNow we got... now this is getting crazy. \nOur country is becoming a third world country, and I\u2019ll tell you, you have great, great people in the Justice Department. Great great people in the FBI. Great great people. And they\u2019re embarrassed by what\u2019s going on. They are embarrassed by what\u2019s going on. Believe me. \nJust like you\u2019re embarrassed and I\u2019m embarrassed. \nHillary Clinton slanders and attacks anyone who wants to put America first, whether they\u2019re [inaudible...] what she said about Bernie voters, amazing. \nLike the European Union, she wants to erase our borders, and she wants to do it for her donors, and she wants people to pour into our country without knowing who they are. \nAnd you want to see problems? You watch. \nThese special interests pay her for speeches and she\u2019s a lousy speaker. They pay her foundation. They pay her husband. In return they get your jobs. They get your jobs. \nAnd you\u2019re standing here from Pennsylvania, you\u2019re standing here right now, and I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s happened. People are negotiating and owners of companies are negotiating to move your companies out to Mexico and other places. \nYou watch, and it\u2019s getting worse. It\u2019s not getting better; it\u2019s getting worse. \nAnd you\u2019re unsuspecting. Right now you say to your wife, \u201cLet\u2019s go to a movie after Trump,\u201d but you won\u2019t do that because you\u2019ll be so high and so excited that no movie is going to satisfy you. Okay? No movie. \nYou know why? Honestly, because they don\u2019t make movies like they used to. Am I right? What a difference. \nLike I\u2019ve been saying all week, when it comes to Hillary Clinton, all you have to do is these three words \u2013 follow the money. \nOne in three companies that lobbied for TPP passage donated to the Clinton Foundation as much as $67 million dollars. \nNine companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP gave Hillary Clinton $2.7 million dollars for speeches. Now she does them for free and very few people show up. \nWhen she went to Pennsylvania last week. Did you see her? It was a small room. They couldn\u2019t fill the seats. Look at this place. Look at that. \nHey media, turn your cameras over there. Turn your cameras over there. They don\u2019t do it. They never turn the cameras. The only time they turn the cameras because they\u2019re dishonest as hell. \nAnd you know, they don\u2019t realize one thing, if they showed the kind of... look at that all the way out to the door way past it and people outside. \nIf they showed the kind of crowds we have, which people can hear, you know it\u2019s interesting. You can hear the crowd when you hear the television. You can hear the crowd, but if they showed it, it would be better television. But they don\u2019t know much about that but it would actually be better television. \nSo three TPP member countries gave $6 and $15 million dollars to Clinton. \nAt least four lobbyist who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more that $800,000 for her campaign. \nI\u2019m just telling you Pennsylvania. We\u2019re going to make it. We\u2019re going to make it, but we\u2019re going to make it. \nWe\u2019re going to make it if we have Pennsylvania that\u2019s for sure. That would make it easy. \nBut I\u2019m just telling you, you cannot let this pass. Not to pass. \nYou look at what\u2019s going on in the Middle East when they bomb these cities and they\u2019re leveled. You can imagine how many people died. She has been a disaster. \nBut here\u2019s a woman, she\u2019s supposed to fight all of these different things, and she can\u2019t make it 15 feet to her car. Give me a break. Give me a break. Give me a break! \nShe\u2019s home resting right now. She\u2019s getting ready for her next speech, which is going to be about 15 minutes and it\u2019s going to be in two or three days. \nFolks, we need stamina. We need energy. We need people that are going to turn deals around. \nWe can\u2019t let China take advantage of us anymore. \nAnd we have the piggy bank, we have the advantage. \nBy the way, don\u2019t worry. You know they like to talk about temperament. You know that\u2019s a word they got from Madison Avenue. \u201cLet\u2019s see. How can we attack Trump?\u201d \nI have a great temperament. I have, in my opinion, it\u2019s like one of my strongest things. I have a winning temperament. But you know how they choose it. We have a winning temperament because our country doesn\u2019t win anymore. \nNow, she\u2019s got bad temperament. She can be crazy. She could actually be crazy. \nLet me tell you. Did you see..because all the members are going to vote...you know, the top guys are going to be with her because the top people, you know...we\u2019ll tell you about that some day. \nThe AFL-CIO. How many members here are in the AFL-CIO? Many? All right. Not too many. Where are you? \nBut the top people are usually against...and the unions, they\u2019re going to be with me because I\u2019m going to produce jobs. We\u2019re going to build our infrastructure and rebuild our infrastructure. She wouldn\u2019t know where to begin. She wouldn\u2019t know where to begin. \nSo I only say this, look, we need somebody who is strong. We need somebody that knows what they\u2019re doing. We\u2019re going to bring the greatest people. \nSo we have now, in fact, it\u2019s going to be announced next week, some additional 200 plus admirals and generals supporting us, 17 winners of the Congressional Medal of Honor, the recipients, these great recipients of the Congressional...17. \nAlmost every police organization in the country. I mean, you take a look. Law and order and justice. Law and order and justice. The border patrol. ICE. \nI mean, we have so many thousands and millions and millions of people. \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you with the unions. We have the support of the people underneath the boss that sit up there with their million dollar salaries and they work with the Democrats but they don\u2019t get anything. But we have the support of the people within the unions. We have the support. \nYou watch what\u2019s going to happen. \nAnd we have the support of the Hispanics and the African-Americans because they are tired of being ripped off and taken advantage of. Believe me. You watch. \nThey\u2019re going to have some big beautiful surprises on Nov. 8th, folks. \nHillary Clinton all but said that most of the country is racist, including the men and women of law enforcement. She said that the other night. \nDid anybody like Lester Holt? Did anybody question her when she said that? No, she said it the other night. \nYou\u2019re not a diehard Clinton fan. You\u2019re not a supporter. \nFrom day one, Hillary Clinton thinks that you\u2019re a defective person. That\u2019s what she\u2019s going on around saying. \nHow on earth can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has nothing but contempt for the people who live in the country? She\u2019s got contempt. \nFirst of all, she\u2019s been in so many scandals, and she\u2019s been caught cheating so much. \nAnd one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever witnessed as a citizen of the United States, was last week when the FBI Director was trying so hard to explain how she got away with what she got away with because she should be in prison. \nLet me tell you, she should be in prison. \nWe\u2019re leading in states that never really played for Republicans, but we\u2019re leading all over. We\u2019re doing so great.  \nIf we win the state of Pennsylvania wins, where I went to school, where my kids went to school, if we win the state of Pennsylvania, we are going to have a country that you are going to be so proud of. Believe me. \nSo let\u2019s not forget the other night, the recent debate, which I think I won to be honest with you even though they gave me a bum mic. \nOkay. So how many people did you see that \u2013 they call it \u201cthe commission\u201d on the debates. The commission. You know, \u201ccommission\u201d. They did a great job. \nI go to mics all the time. The mics are working. \nHere we have the commission on presidential debates. Big fancy name and they gave me a bum mic. \nAnd I\u2019ve got to scream into the mic and I\u2019ve friends in the audience and they keep going like this. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d They gave me a bum mic. \nSo how many people, in this room, think that maybe that was done on purpose? Yeah. Okay? \nAnd the head man, after an hour and a half and it\u2019s over, and I got great press, people coming up. Now, I got great press until what happened. One minute later all of the dopes that work at CNN, they said \u201cOh, Trump lost\u201d they start screaming. I don\u2019t even think half of them watched because they want to change the narrative. \nBut you watch that, and if you watched that without being influenced by these phony pundits. \nDon\u2019t forget folks. They have been calling us wrong from the beginning. They have been calling us wrong from June 16th. We had no chance. We were running against professionals. We were running against senators and governors and we had no chance. Right? And then one by one. Boom. Boom. \nAnd it used to be great. I used to watch these characters on television. \u201cDonald Trump has not won 25%.\u201d That was early. I said you know you have 17 people in the race right. Then they go, two weeks later, another victory. Another one. Another one. They say \u201cDonald Trump has not won 38%.\u201d Then I had one where we had a lot of people left and I had 49% of the votes with a lot of people. You understand what that means... \nSo then we have 49% with a lot of people running. And you know, We are talking about senators. We are talking about governors. We are talking about people like Ben Carson, who are great people and who endorse me. But smart people. Good people. Ben Carson, by the way, great guy. \nBut they said, and I will never forget it. 49% with many people, and they said to me. They said it right over the television. \u201cBut Donald Trump has not hit 50% yet\u201d. How the hell do you hit 50% when you have like 11 people left? \nBut then we lost a couple more. Very sad, very sad to watch. We were all broken up. Right? Because I guarantee most of the people in this room were with us from the beginning. So we were all broken up. Really. \nAnd then we started getting 52%. 58%. 66%. 78%. 82%. And they just didn\u2019t know what was going on. \nAnd now they said, with crooked Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s all we have left is crooked Hillary. \nI mean, here\u2019s a woman that is supposed to fight Putin. Here\u2019s a woman who\u2019s supposed to fight trade deals in China. They\u2019re ripping us like nobody has ever ripped us in the history of the world. \nHere\u2019s a woman that is supposed to be fighting Putin. Here is a woman that has given Barack Obama such bad advice, that I guarantee you, if he had the choice to do all over again \u2013 go back years \u2013 he would have never picked her for Secretary of State. She\u2019s been a disaster. Everything she has done has been bad. It\u2019s ended in huge financial loss and death, and I mean death on both sides. \nBecause if we don\u2019t win on Nov. 8th. \nFirst of all, I have tens and tens of millions of dollars. Nobody else does. I put my own money into this. Plus, we have small supporters. A limited number of people that just want to help the Republican Party. \nBut I have put self-funding in to a level that they haven\u2019t seen maybe ever or maybe for a many, many years. \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what and the money is the least of it. I\u2019ve put a lot of energy. We put a lot of heart and soul, all of us. I know some of you people get here at 12 p.m. in the afternoon for this and earlier. \nI know, I know, I know. \nHere\u2019s the good news. When you leave is it worth it? Is it worth it? \nBut if we don\u2019t win on Nov. 8th, I will say, I don\u2019t care what they write. I don\u2019t care if they have to give us a lot of credit. I think they have to give us credit. I will consider it a tremendous waste of time, energy, and money. Believe me. \nBecause if we don\u2019t get there, we\u2019re not going to able to do the job. \nAnd we\u2019re going to be doing something for this country that this country has needed for many, many years. We are going to do something so spectacular. You\u2019re going to be so proud of your country once again. You\u2019re not proud of country now. You\u2019re certainly not proud of your leader. \nHow about last week... Are you proud of your leader? \nHow about two weeks ago, $400 million in cash go into Iran? Right? Remember the hostages, and then he lied about that. He said, \u201cNo, no, it wasn\u2019t for hostages.\u201d But the hostages couldn\u2019t leave until they got the cash. \nBut it turned out to be wrong because it\u2019s now looking like it\u2019s... and get this, see the corners over there. You couldn\u2019t fit them in here. $1.7 billion in cash they paid to a terrorist nation. They paid to Iran. $1.7 billion. \nOr how about last week? They were going to deport 800 people. They were all ready for deportation, which means they had problems. But they made a mistake. And instead of deporting these 800 people back to the Middle East, guess what happened? They became United States citizens. \nAnd then that turned out be wrong just like the $400 million became $1.7 billion. \nWell, it looks like the 800 people are 1,700 people, and welcome, welcome, welcome, folks. \nAnd then I said, \u201cWell, you made a mistake, so undo it.\u201d They said, \u201cWell, we can\u2019t do that because that wouldn\u2019t be constitutional.\u201d \nThe world looks at us like we\u2019re stupid people. \nBut we\u2019re not going to be stupid people much longer, folks. Tell you. And you\u2019ve got to go out, you\u2019ve got to go out, and you\u2019ve got to get your friends, and you\u2019ve got to get everybody you know. \nAnd you\u2019ve got to watch your polling booths because I hear too many stories about Pennsylvania, certain areas. I hear too many bad stories, and we can\u2019t lose an election because of you know what I\u2019m talking about. \nSo, go and vote, and then go check out areas because a lot of bad things happen. And we don\u2019t want to lose for that reason. We don\u2019t want to lose, but we especially we don\u2019t want to lose for that reason. So, go over and watch and watch carefully because we\u2019re going to win the state of Pennsylvania. \nAnd if we win Pennsylvania, we take back the White House. \nWe\u2019re leading in Ohio. We\u2019re leading in North Carolina. I think we\u2019re leading all over the place. \nWe are going to stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth and plenty of other people. \nAnd we\u2019re going to help all of the people in our country who are so horribly addicted to what\u2019s coming in. But we\u2019re going to stop it and we\u2019re going to stop it fast. \nAnd who is going to pay for the wall? 100%. They may not know it yet but they\u2019re paying. Believe me, they\u2019re paying. They haven\u2019t figured that one out yet. \nHillary Clinton is controlled by global special interests. She\u2019s on the opposite side of Bernie on the trade issue. She is totally in the opposite side of Bernie. \nA new audio tape that has surfaced just yesterday from another one of Hillary\u2019s high-roller fundraisers shows her demeaning and mocking Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. \nAnd you know, I\u2019ll tell you something. We have a much bigger movement than Bernie Sanders ever had. True. It\u2019s true. We have much bigger crowds than Bernie Sanders ever had. It\u2019s true. And we have a more important movement than Bernie Sanders ever had because we\u2019re going to save our country. Okay? We\u2019re going to save our country. \nBut I can tell you that Bernie Sanders would have left a great, great legacy had he not made the deal with the devil. He really would have left a great legacy. \nNow he shows up and a 120 people come in to hear him talk. Bernie Sanders would have left a great legacy had he not made the deal, had he held his head high and walked away. \nNow he\u2019s on the other side perhaps from us but we want to get along with everybody and we will. We going to unite the country. \nBut what Bernie Sanders did to his supporters was very, very unfair, and they\u2019re really not his supporters any longer and they\u2019re not going to support Hilary Clinton. I really believe a lot of those people and coming over and largely because of trade, college education, lots of other things, but largely because of trade. They\u2019re coming over to our side. You watch. You watch. \nEspecially after Hillary mocks him and mocks all of those people by attacking him and his supports as living in their parents\u2019 basements and trapped in dead-end careers. That\u2019s not what they are. \nShe describes many of them as ignorant, and they want the United States to be more like Scandinavia but that half the people don\u2019t know what that means in a really sarcastic tone. \u2018Cause she\u2019s a sarcastic woman. \nTo sum up, and I\u2019ll tell you the other thing, she\u2019s an incompetent woman and I\u2019ve seen it. She\u2019s an incompetent woman. \nJust take a look at what she touches. It never works out. \nAnd you watch, her run for the presidency will never, ever work out \u2018cause we can\u2019t let it work out. \nTo sum up, Hilary Clinton thinks Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters are hopeless and ignorant basement dwellers. \nThen of course, she thinks people who vote for and follow us are deplorable and irredeemable. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. \nWe have the smartest people. We have the sharpest people. We have the most amazing people. \nAnd you know, in all of the years of this country, they say \u2013 even the pundits \u2013 most of them aren\u2019t worth the ground they\u2019re standing on, some of their ground could be very wealthy ground, but most of these people say that they have never seen a phenomenon like this going on. \nWe have crowds like this wherever we go. We have these massive crowds. And some call it the greatest phenomenon they\u2019ve ever seen politically in their lives. And I think that\u2019s what it is. \nBut remember this, one of them said to me, not so long ago, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you win or lose. What you\u2019ve done is amazing.\u201d \nYou know what I said? \u201cForget it.\u201d \n...I\u2019m thrilled to be here tonight. Beautiful city \u2013 Manheim! \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what, we\u2019re gonna win the great state of Pennsylvania. I went to school in Pennsylvania. We are going to win Pennsylvania. \nWe are going to win back the White House and we going to be so happy. We are going to be so happy and we are going to again be so proud of our country. We will be proud. \nWe\u2019re going to take on the corrupt media, the powerful lobbyists, and the special interests that have stolen your jobs, your factories, and your future, and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened. \nAnd we are going to stop Hillary Clinton from continuing to raid the industry from your state for her profit. \nHillary Clinton has collected millions of dollars from the same global corporations shipping your jobs and your dreams to other countries. You know it and everybody else knows it. \nThat\u2019s why, Clinton, if she ever got the chance would 100% approve Trans-Pacific Partnership, a total disastrous trade deal. She called the deal the gold standard. \nThe TPP will bring economic devastation to Pennsylvania, and our campaign is America\u2019s one and only chance to stop that and lots of other bad things that are happening to our country. \nAnd she lied about the gold standard the other night at the debate. She said she didn\u2019t say it. She said it. \nAnd we don\u2019t want to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership and if we don\u2019t then remember this \u2013 if we don\u2019t stop it billions and billions of jobs and wealth will be vacuumed right out of Pennsylvania and sent to those other countries. Just like NAFTA was a disaster, this will be a disaster. \nFrankly, I don\u2019t think it will be as bad as NAFTA. It can\u2019t get any worse than that. Signed by Bill Clinton. \nAll of us here in this massive room tonight can prevent this from happening. Together we will stop TPP, and we can end the theft of American jobs and prosperity. \nOne man, and folks, we have to do it. It\u2019s time. \nIt\u2019s time we bring our country back. It\u2019s time we act like intelligent people. It\u2019s time that we don\u2019t let Mexico and all of these other countries take our jobs and that\u2019s what they are doing. \nYou look at here, the miners. Look at the way they\u2019re been treated. We are going to protect our miners. We are going to protect our steel workers. We are going to protect our factories and our manufacturing. \nNow look, I knew one man. I\u2019m not a big fan but one man who knew the dangers of TPP was Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie. \nHe was right about one thing \u2013 only one thing \u2013 and that was trade, and he was right about it because he knew we were getting ripped off but he wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about it. \nWe\u2019re going to do a lot about it. We\u2019re going to have those highways running the opposite direction. We\u2019re going to have a lot of trade but it\u2019s going come into our country. \nWe are going to start benefitting our country because right now it\u2019s a one way road to trouble. \nOur jobs leave us. Our money leaves us. \nWith Mexico, we get the drugs; they get the cash. That simple. \nAnd by the way, by the way, we\u2019re going to have a very, very powerful, a very ,very strong southern border. And we\u2019re going to have drugs stop pouring into our country. \nAnd we will build the wall. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Delaware, Ohio", "text": "Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. \nAnd is there any better place to be than a Trump rally? Or any safer place, too. \nIt\u2019s a campaign about rejected the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment, which is doing great harm to everybody \u2013 to us. \nI am going to fight for every citizen of every background from every stretch of this nation. \nI\u2019m going to fight for every child living in poverty. \nI\u2019m going to fight for every mom who lost their child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence. \nI\u2019m going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of our states like Ohio and Pennsylvania and Florida and so many others. You take a look at New England. You take a look at what\u2019s happened. You take a look at New York state, upstate New York, and you see what\u2019s going on. We will never ever ever let that happen again. We\u2019re going to bring them back. \nI\u2019m going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and the special interests. \nAnd I\u2019m going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. \nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God saluting one American flag. \nIn 10 years, in 20 years, in 30 years, you\u2019re going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. We\u2019ve had a good time. But important things are happening. \nYou\u2019re going to remember this day \u2013 this is a movement like nobody has seen in this country before. \nYou\u2019re going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most important vote that I\u2019ve ever cast for anyone at anytime. \nYou\u2019re going to be so proud of your country again. \nAnd hopefully you\u2019ll be very, very proud of your president because he will do a great job. \nAnd when we win, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. \nThank you everybody. Thank you, Ohio. God bless you. \nThey have no \u2013 no guards, no safeguards. They don\u2019t talk about currency manipulation in the agreement. It\u2019s thousands of pages long. \nIt\u2019s a disaster for Ohio and Pennsylvania and any place that makes anything. It\u2019s bad. \nHillary\u2019s plan includes an open border with the Middle East, meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores. \nJust last week, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department plead guilty to joining ISIS. There are many of them. \nSo let me state this as clearly as I can: If I\u2019m elected president of the United States, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. \nWe\u2019ve got enough problems, don\u2019t you think? Don\u2019t you think we have enough? \nThat\u2019ll end up being the great Trojan horse that they\u2019ll read about it in 200 years like you read about Trojan horse current. That will be and we don\u2019t want to be a part of that history. \nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders. \nAnd yes, we will build the wall. We need it. And Mexico will pay for the wall. \nWe got the first ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol officers. First time they\u2019ve ever endorsed a candidate for president. \nEvery year countless American lives are lost to sanctuary cities. My opponent strongly supports sanctuary cities. I don\u2019t think she knows why. Like the ones they got Kate Steinle killed by a five-time deported criminal illegal immigrant. \nIf I\u2019m elected president, I\u2019m going to cut off federal funding to sanctuary cities and quickly. \nAnd we are going to make sure that our immigration authorities do the job that they\u2019re supposed to be doing. And these, in many cases, are great people that are not allowed to do the job. \nI can tell you in the case of the border patrol and the ICE agents, these are great American people that frankly, by backing me, they\u2019re going to working much harder. They don\u2019t have to stand back. You know the expression? It\u2019s called stand back. People just walk right into our country. \nWe are going to save American lives. Either we win this election or we are going to lose this country. \nTo sum up, here is some of the amazing things we\u2019re going to be doing for our country starting in 2017. \nWe are going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan. \nWe will eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation, which affects so many. \nWe will defend our religious liberty. \nWe will provide school choice to every low-income child in America. And we are going to end Common Core. Education is going to be brought locally. \nWe will totally support the men and women of law enforcement. \nWe talked about this last night at the debate. We will save the Second Amendment, which right now is under siege. \nAnd I will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \nYou have 19 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your children, for your family, for your country, come true. \nThank you. God bless you. Thank you. \nA Trump administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, the worst ever signed, probably the worst trade ever signed in history, stand up to foreign cheating and currency manipulation, and stop the jobs from leaving our country. We are going to stop them. It won\u2019t be hard. Won\u2019t be hard. \nIn order to help bring our jobs back to Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, all across this great nation, I\u2019m going to undertake a major reorganization of our bureaucracy, which we have to do. Have to do. \nAmerican trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the departments of agriculture, commerce, labor, state, treasury. All of these departments, so many departments. \nGet that mosquito out of here. Get a little nervous with mosquitoes nowadays, folks. But up here, you haven\u2019t been hit yet, right? That\u2019s what we need is a nice mosquito bite. \nThank you. I love you, too. \nMosquito bite right smack in the middle of the nose. No, we don\u2019t want it. \nIn my administration, all trade policy making will be consolidated into one very important office. We\u2019re going to call it the American Desk, and it will be located inside the Department of Commerce. And I\u2019ll be checking with those people because we\u2019re not going to lose our companies anymore. \nIt\u2019s so complicated. So many different departments have to get involved, and by the time they get involved, they\u2019re gone, they signed with all of these other countries. \nThe mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker and the national interests of the United States because they are hurting our national interest. \nWe owe $20 trillion right now, doubled under Obama, and we haven\u2019t done anything. Our roads are bad. Our airports are bad. Our schools are bad. Everything is bad. They\u2019re falling down. \nSo we have all this debt. We haven\u2019t started yet because we have to fix the infrastructure of our country. \nIt\u2019s going to be America first, believe me. \nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35% to 15%. \nWe\u2019re also going to rebuild our inner cities. \nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering. The violence is unbearable and unbelievable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot. There\u2019s no education. There are no jobs. And there\u2019s practically no safety. \nNearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, since Jan. 1st, 3,500 people. That\u2019s worse than what you are reading about over in the Middle East in many cases. \nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. And it\u2019s getting worse. \nTo the African-American and Hispanic communities who are suffering, I say what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump. I\u2019m going to fix the inner cities. I\u2019m going to fix the inner cities. What do you have to lose? Seriously and I mean it. \nThe inner cities are so bad. They\u2019ve been run so badly by Democrats for decades and decades and decades, sometimes more than an hundred years unbroken. And they get the votes and they go on their way and they don\u2019t do a thing. \nSo I hope the African-Americans, I hope the Hispanics; I hope they\u2019re going to vote. \nWe will be a rich nation once again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country, and national security begins at the border. \nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally open trade and open borders. \nYou saw that last night when she tried to lie about it, right? She tried to lie about it, and she came up with something, she was talking about energy. \nShe tried to lie about it just like she lied about other things. She tried to lie last night. Remember she said TPP, which by the way is a disaster. It will be a disaster for Ohio. \nWhen I\u2019m president, if a company wants to fire their workers and leave for Mexico or other countries, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States. Then they won\u2019t leave, believe me. Those companies will not leave. If we do that, they will not leave and you know what, if they do, that will be fine. We\u2019ll make a lot of money. But they\u2019re not going to be leaving. \nAnd our politicians should have told you this years ago. You would have stopped this horrible onslaught of companies leaving. \nBut two things. Either they\u2019re not very smart or they are smart but they\u2019re controlled by their donors and special interests. Okay? So either way, the people lose. \nHillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors, who want to shift our jobs to other countries. You know that. You saw that last night. \nRemember when I said \u201copen border\u201d and she said \u201copen border, I don\u2019t want open border\u201d. But it turned out she wanted open borders. \nBoy, that Wikileaks has done a job on her, hasn\u2019t it? \nAnd you take a look. She really has a hatred almost for Catholics. She has a hatred for evangelicals. I mean what they said about Catholics and evangelicals, so many other things. So many other things. \nAnd actually, the one that I liked was John Podesta, saying, that who\u2019s her campaign chairman, saying that, \u201cHillary Clinton has bad instincts\u201d. She\u2019s got bad instincts. I don\u2019t want somebody with bad instincts as our president. \nI\u2019ll tell you, if I were Hillary, I\u2019d fire that guy. He\u2019s saying so many bad things. \nWell, Bill said about Obamacare, right? Two weeks ago. He said, \u201cThis is the craziest thing I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. He was right. He suffered that evening, right? \nBut this is why I\u2019m proposing a package of ethic reforms to make up a government honest once again. It\u2019s time to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington D.C. and we\u2019re going to do it. \nThose reforms include the following: \nA five-year ban on executive branch in congressional officials lobbying the government after they leave government service. They\u2019re making a fortune. Not going to happen. That\u2019s why they make all these sweetheart deals. \nA lifetime ban on former executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. \nA ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. I don\u2019t want that. You don\u2019t want that. Nobody wants that. And you wonder why we make all of these dumb deals, those horrible deals. \nFriends of mine come up \u201cHow could have they made such a stupid deal. They can\u2019t be that\u201d and I said \u201cThey are actually smart. But you have to understand, this is the way the system works.\u201d \nAdditionally, I\u2019m going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. It\u2019s about time. \nNot only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation. \nMy plan for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. \nAt the center of what will be a historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals and they are terrible. \n47 million Americans are in poverty, and 45 million Americans are right now on food stamps. \nWe have nearly $800 billion annual trade deficits in goods with the world. \nAnd the worst so-called recovery, since the Great Depression. And you know, we hear about a recovery. It\u2019s the worst since the Great Depression. Hard to believe. \nOhio has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade Organization. Two deals done by Bill and backed strongly by crooked Hillary. \nAmerica has lost \u2013 listen to this \u2013 70,000 factories since China joined the WTO. \nAnd by the way, try doing business over in China. Not that easy, folks. Not easy. \nWe\u2019re living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. They\u2019re stealing our jobs. They\u2019re stealing our companies. They\u2019re taking our money. \nWe have drugs. We have debt. We have empty factories. That\u2019s going to end. That\u2019s going to end. So easy. \nTerrible. Those are terrible and frightening statistics. \nAmerica is a constitutional republic with a system of laws. These laws are triggered in the case of fraud or in the event of a recount where it\u2019s needed. \nOf course, I would accept a clear election result. But I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result. \nRight? \nAnd always, I will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all of the many candidates who have come before me. Always. \nBottom line, we\u2019re gonna win. We\u2019re gonna win. We\u2019re gonna win so big. We\u2019re gonna win so big. Nov. 8th, we\u2019re going to win. \nTogether we are going to deliver real change that puts again America first. It\u2019s gonna be America first. \nThank you. Boy, do you people have spirit. So early. Beautiful. It\u2019s a beautiful thing to see. \nAll over the country it\u2019s the same-the spirit-it\u2019s a movement like they\u2019ve never seen. \nThe dishonest media, they\u2019ve never seen anything like it. They\u2019ve never seen, never seen anything like it. They\u2019ve never seen anything like it. \nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals; end illegal immigration; stop the massive inflow of refugees; reduce surging crime; cut taxes and regulation; unleash job producing energy -American energy; rebuild our military; and take care of our vets. \nNow, our vets. Our great veterans have not been taken care of the way they should be taken care of. That I can tell you. Our vets are treated often times not as well as illegal immigrants. And we\u2019re going to change that very fast. Our vets are going to be treated properly and with great respect. That\u2019s not happening now. \nAnd we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Just in case you haven\u2019t noticed, rates are going up 60%, 70%, 80%. Next year is going to be worse. It\u2019s a catastrophe and it\u2019s dying anyway but we are going to repeal it, replace it. You\u2019re going to have great health care at a fraction of the cost, okay? \nYour jobs will come back under a Trump administration. Your jobs have fled. \nYour incomes will go up under a Trump administration. \nYour taxes will go way down under a Trump administration. And Hillary Clinton is going to raise your taxes. She\u2019s going to raise your taxes. \nYour companies won\u2019t be leaving Ohio under a Trump administration. \nRight now our economy isn\u2019t growing practically at all. Last Quarter it was only around 1% GDP. People have hardly ever heard of numbers like that. \nIf in China it goes to 7% or 8%, it\u2019s like considered a national catastrophe. \nHere, we\u2019re at 1%; isn\u2019t everything wonderful? Everything is not wonderful. And if it was wonderful, we wouldn\u2019t have packed auditoriums no matter where we go. Believe me. \nI\u2019m going to get us to 4% growth and maybe more and create 25 million jobs for our country over the next 10 years. \nMany workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago. They\u2019re working harder. They\u2019re working longer. But they\u2019re making less. And in some cases they\u2019re working two and three jobs but still taking home less money. It\u2019s ridiculous. They\u2019re getting older. They\u2019re working harder. \nAnd so am I. I\u2019m working harder and I\u2019m getting older too. Believe me. I\u2019m working harder. \nCompanies like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico. \nFord is moving all of their small car production to Mexico. \nBut I ask you: Why shouldn\u2019t Hillary Clinton resign from the race? She was given, think of it \u2013 she was given these questions. She used these questions, studied the questions, got the perfect answer for the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally wrong and inappropriate. Hence the name, Crooked Hillary. \nYears ago there was a show called \u201cThe $64,000 Question\u201d. A contestant got the questions in advance, and his life was ruined. They found out about it, remember? Anybody remember his name? Come on... \nVan Doren, very good! You look younger than that. Charles Van Doren. \nCharles Van Doren was his name. He got the questions, and his life was ruined. \nBut Hillary... Hillary Clinton got the ques... Think of it. Forget Donna Brazile. She should resign. She looked like such a fool last night on television trying to say \u201cWell\u201d... She didn\u2019t know what was going on. She had no idea. She said, \u201cGet me out of here.\u201d She got the questions. She got the questions. She gave them to Hillary Clinton. \nHillary Clinton didn\u2019t say, \u201cI\u2019d like to announce that a mistake was made, and I can\u2019t take these ques...\u201d I mean look, how many questions are there? Right? \nCan you imagine if I got the questions? They would call for the re-establishment of the electric chair. Do you agree with it? Right? \nShe got the questions, and she didn\u2019t report it. She went out there knowing the questions. She didn\u2019t report it. That is very dishonest. She\u2019s a very dishonest person. \nThis is even bigger because we are going for the presidency of the United States. So, this is very important. \nHillary Clinton is the most corrupt and dishonest person ever to seek the office of the presidency. \nSo, it\u2019s in that context that I was asked a question about whether I would agree in advance to concede the results on election night if for some reason we should lose, which we\u2019re not going to lose. \nAnd that was sort of unprecedented question. \nIf Al Gore or George Bush had agreed three weeks before the election to concede the results and waive their right to a legal challenge or a recount, then there would be no Supreme Court case, and no Bore... Gore versus Bush or Bush versus Gore. And there have been numerous other cases. \nIn effect, I\u2019m being asked to wave centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters. \nBut listen to this. According to Pew, highly respected, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate. \nOkay, I think the people in this room understand it more than our leaders. Although, maybe our leaders understand more than we think they understand. \nListen to this: 1.8 million people are dead, but they\u2019re registered to vote. Some of whom vote even though they\u2019re dead, which is really a hard thing to do but it\u2019s easy if fraud is involved. Right? \nSee 1.8 million people who are dead who are registered to vote and some of them vote. One was a Republican and after death became a Democrat. It\u2019s true. \n2.8 million people are registered in more than one state. So, you got 2.8 million people, they can vote in Ohio and someplace else. \nAnd 14% of non-citizens are registered to vote. \nAnd then I hear we have such a beautiful \u2013 everything\u2019s so wonderful... You understand where I\u2019m coming from, I think, right? \nNow I am not a politician. So, I can say it like it is. \n...In 19 days, we are going to win the state of Ohio, and we are going to win the White House. \nAnd I worked in Ohio, and I love Ohio, I can tell you. \nEarly voting is underway so make sure you mail in your ballot, and you have to do it quickly and in person. But on Nov. 8th, get there. We are going to do something that has never been done before in this country, believe me. \nLadies and gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today. \nI would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election \u2013 if I win. \nAll right. Seriously, the debate last night was amazing, and everybody said I won, including every single online poll and some had it at 90% and close to 90%. So that\u2019s pretty good. \nThe question of voter fraud came up during the debate. \nWe want fairness in the election. This is having nothing to do with me but having to do with the future of our country. We have to have fairness. \nJohn Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, was quoted in Wikileaks as saying illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have their driver\u2019s license. \nWhat I\u2019m saying is don\u2019t be naive, folks. Don\u2019t be naive. \nOne of the big issues that came up last night was the fact that the Clinton campaign has paid people to disrupt violently our rallies and to incite absolute, total bedlam. It\u2019s so bad. So bad. \nAnd you know, I\u2019ve had occasions where we had rallies and it was so incredibly violent. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on over here?\u201d These were paid people by the Clinton campaign and it just came out and I give a lot of credit to the people that brought this out, believe me. \nThis is criminal behavior that violates centuries of tradition of peaceful, democratic elections. \nA campaign like Clinton\u2019s that will incite violence is truly a campaign that will do anything to win. \nAnd a candidate like crooked Hillary Clinton, who will lie to Congress, lie to the FBI, destroy 33,000 e-mails, put her office up for sale, and put our confidential information in the reach of our enemies is a candidate who is truly capable of anything, including voter fraud. \nIn addition, it was just learned that Hillary Clinton was given the exact questions to a previous debate, word for word, by Donna Brazile, who is now under tremendous pressure to resign from the DNC, as she should be. She should resign. How can a woman do that? That is cheating at the highest level. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Marron\u2019s testimony on the economic impact of debt ceiling brinksmanship before the Joint Economic Committee \u2013 Sept. 18, 201", "text": "Posted by Jenny Jiang on Monday, September 23, 2013 \u00b7 1 Comment \u00a0 \n...I\u2019d like to make six basic points today. \nFirst, Congress has to increase the debt limit. Failure to do so will result in severe economic harm. \nTreasury would have to delay billions then tens of billions then hundreds of billions of dollars of payments. Through no fault of their own, federal employees, contractors, program beneficiaries, and state and local governments would find themselves suddenly short of expected cash, creating a ripple effect through the economy. \nA prolonged delay will be a powerful anti-stimulus that could easily push our economy back into recession as Mark said. \nIn addition, there\u2019s a risk that we might default on the federal debt. Now, I should emphasize that I expect the Treasury will do everything in its power to make debt service payments on time if it\u2019s pushed to the limit. But there\u2019s a risk that it won\u2019t succeed. \nIndeed, we have precedent for this. In 1979, Treasury accidentally defaulted on a small sliver of debt in the wake of a debt limit showdown. That default was narrow in scope but financial markets reacted badly and interest rates spiked. \nIf a debt limit impasse force Treasury to default today, the results would be much more severe. Interest rates would spike, credit would tighten, financial institutions would scramble for cash, and savers might desert money market funds. \nAnyone who remembers the financial crisis should shudder at the prospect of re-living such disruptions. \nSecond, Treasury doesn\u2019t have any super, extraordinary measures hidden away in a desk drawer if the debt limit isn\u2019t raised in time. \nPundits have suggested that Treasury might sidestep the debt limit by invoking the 14th Amendment, minting extremely large platinum coins, or selling gold or other federal assets. But administration officials have said that none of those strategies would actually work. \nThird, debt limit brinksmanship is costly, even if Congress raises the limit at the last minute. \nAs we saw in 2011, brinksmanship increases interest rates and federal borrowing costs. The Bipartisan Policy Center building on the work by the Government Accountability Office estimates that that crisis will cost taxpayers almost $19 billion in extra interest costs. \nBrinksmanship also increases uncertainty, reduces confidence, and undermines the economy. \nIn 2011, for example, consumer confidence and the stock market both plummeted while measures of financial risks skyrocketed. \nFinally, brinksmanship weakens America\u2019s global image. The United States is the only major nation whose leaders talk openly about self-inflicted default. At the risk of sounding like Vladimir Putin, such exceptionalism is not healthy. \nFourth, as this committee knows well, our economy remains fragile. Now is not the time to hit it with unnecessary shocks. \nFifth, as the CBO confirmed yesterday, the long-run budget outlook remains challenging. \nDeficits have fallen sharply in the past few years but current budget policies would still create an unsustainable trajectory of debt in coming decades. \nCongress should address that problem, but the near-term fiscal priorities are funding the government and increasing the debt limit. \nFinally, Congress should re-think the debt limit and indeed the entire budget process. \nBorrowing decisions cannot be made in a vacuum separate from other fiscal choices. America borrows today because this and previous Congresses chose to spend more than we take in, sometimes with good reasons, sometimes not. \nIf Congress is concerned about debt, it needs to act when it makes those spending and revenue decisions, not months or years later when financial obligations are already in place. \nWhen the dust settles on our immediate challenges, Congress should re-examine the entire budget process, seeking ways to make it more effective and less susceptible to dangerous after-the-fact brinksmanship. \nNow, I\u2019ve completely failed at the challenge of saying something upbeat. So in conclusion, let me say that I think actually all of these challenges are solvable with good spirit of working together... \nYour email address will not be published. \nComment \nName \nEmail \nWebsite \n \n\n "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at the USS Iowa", "text": "I have the smartest people in this country lined up.

Everybody \u2013 think of it, 20,000 people \u2013 there wasn\u2019t one heckler in the whole room. I kept saying, \u201cThere\u2019s got to be one.\u201d \nThere was a word \u2013 two words that used to be used a lot called \u201csilent majority\u201d. They stopped using them. \nThe silent majority, believe me, is back and I think we can use it somewhat different. \nI don\u2019t think we have to call it a silent majority anymore because they\u2019re not silent. People are not silent. \nThey\u2019re disgusted with our incompetent politicians. \nThey\u2019re disgusted with the people that are giving our country away. \nThey\u2019re disgusted when they tell the border patrol agents who are good people and can do the job. \nThey\u2019re disgusted when they\u2019re allowed people to just walk right in front of them and they\u2019re standing there helpless and people just pour into the country. \nThey\u2019re disgusted when a woman who\u2019s nine months pregnant, walks across the border, has a baby, and you have to take care of that baby for the next 85 years. \nThey\u2019re disgusted by what\u2019s happening to our country. \nAnd you\u2019re going to look around and you\u2019re going to remember who the people are that are here because we\u2019re doing something special. This is a movement. We\u2019re going to make our country great again. \nBelieve me, we will make our country great again. \nI love you all. Thank you very much.  \nSo the drugs pour in and the money pours out. Not a good deal. We get the drugs, they get the money. The drug cartels are going wild. They cannot believe how stupid our government is. \nThey are making a fortune. The drugs come in. The money goes out daily. And I saw it because I was on the border. I was there. And we saw it. And everybody sees it everyday. \nAnd we have the kind of people that can do something about it but we have no leadership. None. None whatsoever. \nSo, we\u2019re going to build a wall and Mexico\u2019s going to pay for the wall, believe me. You know, a lot of politicians have said \u201cOh, they\u2019re not going to pay\u201d. They don\u2019t know anything about \u2013 they never read the Art of the Deal, first of all. \nSo here\u2019s the story. So here\u2019s the story. I said the other day to one of my people \u201cWhat is the United State\u2019s trade deficit with Mexico, Japan, and China?\u201d \nSo let\u2019s start with China. Almost $400 billion a year. \nNow, if you have a company where you\u2019re losing $400 billion, you\u2019ve got to do something very fast. \nWe don\u2019t. We\u2019ve been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year frankly for decades. \nNot going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore. \nWith Japan where their massive ships floating right here and they drop off the cars, right? They drop off thousands and thousands and thousands of cars \u2013 millions of cars \u2013 and we sell them beef. We sell them beef. \nAnd they don\u2019t want it because their farmers don\u2019t want our beef. They protest and they send it back. All right? \nIt\u2019s not going to happen that way anymore. \nNow, with Mexico \u2013 and I love Mexico. I have many, many people \u2013 many, many people from Mexico that work with me and they work for me and they buy my apartments. \nSame with China. I have so many people. They pay me millions and millions. What am I supposed to hate China because they gave me millions of dollars to buy an apartment? I don\u2019t think so. \nI had the largest bank in the world as a tenant. It\u2019s from China. Bigger than any bank in this country by many times. They\u2019re from China. \nThe problem that we have is that the leaders of Mexico, Japan, and China and every other country that we do business with, they\u2019re smarter, more cunning, sharper than our leaders. \nI love free trade. The concept is great. But you need smart people.\n... \nPingback: On Trade, Sanders is More Dangerous and Trump More Illiterate | Michigan Standard \nI just want to say that we\u2019re going to come out with some plans in a very short time. \nWe\u2019re going to be building up our military. We\u2019re going to make our military so big and so strong and so great. \nAnd it will be so powerful that I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to ever have to use it. Nobody\u2019s going to mess with us. That I can tell you. \nAnd we\u2019re going to have a President who\u2019s respected by Putin, who\u2019s respected by Iran. \nYou know, let\u2019s talk about for two seconds, let\u2019s talk about the Iran deal. \nNow, Obama and his people call him the Supreme Leader of Iran. Obama talks about the Supreme Leader. Well, I\u2019m not calling him a Supreme Leader. \nBut he said the other day that after this rip-off deal is completed, he will never touch, do business with the United States again. \u201cWe\u2019re finished with the United States.\u201d \nThey\u2019re taking $150 billion. They\u2019re getting a deal that\u2019s going to go right into nuclear weapons much sooner than you think. \nThey\u2019re going to self-police \u2013 think about that one \u2013 they are going to go and self-police. \nThey\u2019ve got the 24-day \u2013 they have 24-day provisions. And by the way, what people don\u2019t understand \u2013 the 24-day provision doesn\u2019t start \u2013 you know this, right? It doesn\u2019t start for a long time before you even get to it. The clock is ticking. It can take forever. We may never get it there. \nIt is one of the dumbest deals and one of the weakest contracts I\u2019ve ever seen of any kind. \nSo, we are going to do things and this country right. \nWe\u2019re not going to sign deals where we have four prisoners over there and there\u2019s still there and we don\u2019t even ask for them. \nOne of them is there because he\u2019s a Christian. We have a writer. We have \u2013 the whole thing is absolutely insane. \nYou know, they asked the President, and they asked Secretary of State Kerry who maybe \u2013 you know, I\u2019ve been saying Hillary Clinton is the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country. Right? All right. I\u2019ve been saying it. But it\u2019s possible \u2013 the world blew up around her. It blew up. Just blew up. The whole world is like a different place. \nIt\u2019s possible that because of this deal made by Secretary Kerry who has absolutely no clue how to negotiate, it may that he\u2019s going to supersede. And I understand that he may want to run for President. He has no chance like she has no chance. \nSo we\u2019re going to see what happens. \nWe have many problems in our country. One of them is immigration. \nNow, I took a tremendous hit when I brought up illegal immigration when I announced I was running for President. \nAnd for two weeks, I said \u2013 you know, Rush Limbaugh \u2013 he\u2019s a great guy \u2013 he said \u201cHe has suffered more incoming\u201d \u2013 meaning the press \u2013 \u201cthan anybody I\u2019ve seen.\u201d \nSo what happened is you have now found out what illegal immigration is all about and I am so happy that I\u2019m the one that brought it to the fore because believe me, it\u2019s a big problem. It is a big problem. \nSo you remember for about two weeks, I said, \u201cBoy this is tougher than I thought running for President.\u201d And then you found out there\u2019s tremendous crime. There\u2019s tremendous drugs pouring across the border. Tremendous. Beyond. Going to Chicago, going to New York, going to LA, going all over our country. \n...Boy, oh, boy. I didn\u2019t expect that. You know, Joe [Arends] and the group [Veterans for a Strong America] called and they said \u201cWould you come over and speak?\u201d \nI\u2019m here for a certain reason. You know, it\u2019s called tomorrow night. So I got here and they asked a couple of days ago if it would possible to come over and say a few words. An endorsement from your group with so many veterans \u2013 hundreds of thousands of veterans \u2013 I really appreciate that, Joe. I did not expect that. \nI didn\u2019t expect it. I didn\u2019t ask for it. \nI will say this: I am with the veterans 100%. They\u2019re our greatest people. They\u2019re being treated terribly. \nNot only the number of deaths, which are obviously \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s going on is incredible. \nBut as of two weeks ago on Wednesday, the vets had the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration. You go in to see a doctor, you wait for days, for days. \nAnd it\u2019s not going to happen. Not going to happen. If I win, believe me, it\u2019s not going to happen. \nAnd one of the things I thought I\u2019d do and I\u2019d stress so strongly \u2013 the veterans hospitals \u2013 obviously they have problems. They\u2019re not properly run. \nAnd when you have to wait long hours and long days and then in some cases have the doctor say \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m going on vacation\u201d, believe me, it doesn\u2019t get much worse than that. \nSo we\u2019re going to create a whole new system. We\u2019re going to take this system apart. \nAnd if they\u2019re not doing the job, the veterans are going to go to private doctors, private hospitals, public hospitals, and we\u2019re going to reimburse those doctors and those hospitals. \nAnd you\u2019re going to get the greatest service of any veterans in any country because you deserve it. And that\u2019s going to be broken down into something that\u2019s going to be very special. \nRight now \u2013 and you know it \u2013 we have illegal immigrants that are treated better by far than our veterans. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore. It\u2019s not going to happen. \nSo, Joe, I just really appreciate it. So unexpected. \nTo be here is an honor. They don\u2019t build ships like this anymore, folks. You know? We don\u2019t do them this way anymore. \nI actually said what about recommissioning \u2013 look at this thing. The largest guns in the world. The most powerful guns. I learned about the Iowa. \nBy the way, Iowa is a great place for a lot of reasons. You know? We have been treated so well in the state of Iowa. It\u2019s been incredible. Number one on the polls and we love those people. They\u2019re great. \nSo this is a great ship and that\u2019s a great state.

Not even close. \nIt has gotten totally out of control. \nI am totally in favor of vaccines but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time. \nBecause you take a baby in \u2013 and I\u2019ve seen it and I\u2019ve seen it and I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time, same exact amount. But you take this little beautiful baby and you pump \u2013 I mean, it looks just like it\u2019s meant for a horse not for a child. \nAnd we\u2019ve had so many instances \u2013 people that work for me just the other day \u2013 two years old, two and a half years old, a child \u2013 a beautiful child \u2013 went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic. \nI only say \u2013 I\u2019m in favor of vaccines.

And I think that\u2019s appropriate. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s rant on Judge Gonzalo Curiel", "text": "So I get sued. Here\u2019s a guy gives me all good marks. He\u2019s late so they\u2019re starting a new lawsuit. Now here\u2019s the thing; this law firm \u2013 because this is like a life study \u2013 this law firm gave a lot of money to the Attorney General of New York, who\u2019s a total lightweight. His name is Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. \nSchneiderman accepts their money, goes to meet with President Obama in Syracuse, when Obama was in Syracuse, and then the next day or two, files a lawsuit against me because they, in my opinion, they gave him a contribution, then goes to see Obama. Just wanting to see how the system works folk. It\u2019s a bad system. Let me tell you. \nSo Obama meets with this dopey Eric Schniederman, who hates our governor. And he wants to run for governor but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen. They go up to Syracuse, meets with Obama and he files a lawsuit. \nSo, bottom line is this. People said you can settle. In fact a lot of people said, \u201cOh before you run, you should settle.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care, the people understand it and they use it.\u201d \nSo when I have 10,000 people and when we have mostly unbelievable reviews, how do you settle? \nAnd in fact when the case started originally, I said \u201cHow can I settle when I have a review like this. Every review is good!\u201d Now I should\u2019ve settled but I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. \nSo I\u2019ll be seeing you in November either as President. \nAnd I will say this, I have all these great reviews but I will say this, I think Judge Curiel should be ashamed of himself. I think it\u2019s a disgrace that he\u2019s doing this. And I look forward to going before a jury, not this judge, a jury, and we will win that trial. We will win that trial, check it out. Check it out, folks. \nYou know, I tell this to people, Nov. 28th I think it\u2019s scheduled. It shouldn\u2019t be a trial. It should be a summary judgment dismissal. \nBy the way, friends of mine that are great lawyers, in fact, one of them represents you, said \u201cHow the hell do you get sued under RICO for a guy that took a course, loved the course, said great things about the course, and then you get sued under RICO?\u201d \nIt is a disgrace. \nNow, I\u2019m talking about Bernie Sanders has a rigged system; it is rigged. I\u2019m talking about I had a rigged system except we won by so much. \nI will tell you, this court system, the judges in this court system, federal court, they ought to look into Judge Curiel, because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace. Okay? \nBut we\u2019ll come back in November. Wouldn\u2019t that be wild if I\u2019m president and I come back to do a civil case? Where everybody likes him. Okay, this is called life, folks. \nSo what happens is, the judge who happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great, I think that\u2019s fine. You know what? I think the Mexicans are going to end up loving Donald Trump when I give all these jobs, okay? I think they\u2019re going to end up. I think they\u2019re going to love. I think they\u2019re going to love me. \nSo here\u2019s what happens. We get sued by a woman and she turns out to be a disaster for them. Her name is Tarla Makaeff. She rated on the report card it\u2019s one to five, five being excellent, the highest mark. She gave me a five across the board. All fives. She then did a video saying it was fantastic \u2013 the most glowing video you\u2019ve ever seen. \nShe then sued me because she wanted her money back. She was such a disaster that this judge, it was her against us. She was such a disaster that this judge allowed her to get out of the case. \nBut we want her to be in the case. And the lawyer said, \u201cYour Honor! We want her to be in the case.\u201d He said \u201cShe\u2019s out of the case.\u201d \nSo now we have others. So we said, \u201cDismiss the case! She\u2019s out of the case.\u201d \u201cNo, we won\u2019t dismiss the case.\u201d \nSo we have 10,000 surveys from former students giving Trump University rave reviews. It\u2019s called and it\u2019s on the website, www.98percentapproval.com. Okay? \nSo we have Marla, so we have Makaeff giving us these great numbers. \nThen we have another one. Bob Guillo. They used him, I think it was Bush \u2013 Jeb Bush, low energy. We have these guys making commercials. Now look, in all fairness, it hasn\u2019t hurt me much because, you know, they use this thing, every once in a while you have one. And we\u2019re going to win. \nBut if I don\u2019t win, and even if I do win, we want to, my kids will open it up again, because it was a terrific school. It was great. It was good. \nSo we have a guy named Bob Guillo, he appeared in a TV attack ad. Can you believe it? They used him on ads against me. \nI had 66,000 negative ads. Over $100 million in Florida alone during the big primary, which I won in a landslide. We had 15,000 negative ads and I won. I almost wonder what do ads mean if you want to know the truth. \nSo you have this guy, Bob Guillo. He appeared in TV attack ads even though he rated the programs a five, meaning excellent, the top mark, across the board. His primary complaint was he would\u2019ve liked to have more comfortable chairs. Okay? Unbelievable. \nThen we have a guy named Art Cohen and he was late to file. So he signed a survey in which he rated the program, either a four or a five. \nI will tell you this, how smart was it to ask everybody that took the course to sign a report, card? \nNow you know what the lawyers are saying? The lawyers are saying \u201cOh, but they were forced. 10,000 people were forced. They were forced and you have pictures.\u201d \nWe actually have video tapes of people, they weren\u2019t forced. A professor said, \u201cWould you sign how you like it?\u201d So that\u2019s it. \nSo he signed all fives and fours out of a possible, the highest marks, and indicated that his only complaint was a lack of nice lunch sandwiches. Okay? Think of it. \nSo he was late, so they went to the judge, and the judge said \u201cHe was late.\u201d Why don\u2019t you file under RICO? Organized crime?\u201d \nNow we\u2019ve all been sued in business for RICO. Even Papa John probably. We ever said everybody. RICO\u2019s like \u2013 but they ended it pretty much. \n...So I end up with a lawsuit, and it ends up in San Diego in federal court. \nAnd it\u2019s a disgrace the way the federal court is acting because it\u2019s a simple lawsuit. Everybody that took the so-called course, it\u2019s Trump University is in San Diego! \nAnd the trial, they wanted to start while I\u2019m running for president. The trial is going to take place sometime in November. There should be no trial. \nThis should\u2019ve been dismissed on summary judgment easily. Everybody says it, but I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump. A hater. He\u2019s a hater. \nHis name is Gonzalo Curiel. And he is not doing the right thing. \nAnd I figure, \u2018What the hell. Why not talk about it for two minutes?\u2019 Should I talk about it? Yes? \nSo we should\u2019ve won. I\u2019m being railroaded. \nSo here\u2019s the story. Very simple story. \nA number of years ago, a long time ago now, I open up a school, a little school, we called it Trump University, changed the name, we had probably I don\u2019t know, a lot of people like 10,000 people. \nYou, did you like it? She said she was there, she liked it. \nHere\u2019s the story. So we open up and it really was successful from the beginning. \nThen we get these class action lawyers, they immediately sue. My people did a good job for a couple of reasons. \nOne of the reasons was they had everybody that took the course sign like a report card. So we had, let\u2019s say 10,000 people, almost that many sign the report card. And the report cards are unbelievable. \nBy the way, without that it\u2019s their word versus these people or me. \nBut I\u2019m getting railroaded by a legal system that frankly they should be ashamed. \nBecause this is a case, that I\u2019ll be here in November. Hey! If I win as president, it\u2019s a civil case, I could\u2019ve settled this case numerous times, but I don\u2019t want to settle cases when we\u2019re right. I don\u2019t believe in it. And when you start settling cases, you know what happens? Everybody sues you because you get known as a settler. One thing about me, I am not known as a settler. \nAnd people understand that this whole thing, with this whole deal, with the lawyers, class-action lawyers, they\u2019re the worst. It\u2019s a scam. \nSo here\u2019s what happens; we\u2019re in front of a very hostile judge. The judge was appointed by Barack Obama, federal judge. Frankly he should recuse himself. Because he\u2019s given us ruling after ruling after \u2013 negative, negative, negative. I have a top lawyer who said he\u2019s never seen anything like this before. \nSo what happens is, we get sued. We have a magistrate named William Gallo who truly hates us, and this is what. \nNow, the good news is, it\u2019s a jury trial. But we can\u2019t even get a full jury. We\u2019re entitled to a jury, we want a jury of 12 people, and you\u2019re gonna watch. \nFirst of all, it should be dismissed before the trial, but if we have a trial, we\u2019ll go all the way. Watch how we win it because I\u2019ve been treated unfairly. \nVery much like with the veterans, where I raise all that money but on Tuesday I\u2019m announcing all of the groups that we\u2019ve given almost $6 million to. You know you turn things around. \nSo here\u2019s the story. We have a law-firm named Robbins Geller, where basically, Robbins Geller is a spinoff of two law firms \u2013 [inaudible]... Two of those partners went to jail for an extended period of time for doing very bad things legally. This same group is the lawyers against.

And I don\u2019t mind having a big, beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally. \nBut we need \u2013 Jeb \u2013 to build a wall.

That\u2019s what we do. \nWhen you see these things where they\u2019re building a bridge and it\u2019s going to cost, you know, $1 billion and it costs $12 billion. How about when they build a hospital and it costs $3 billion? \nAnd I look at it \u2013 I\u2019m very good \u2013 I can look at a building and tell you how much it\u2019s going to cost. \nI say \u201c$250 million.\u201d \u201cNo, sir, $3 billion.\u201d $3 billion? Think somebody got rich on that one? \nSo we\u2019re going to stop all this stuff. We\u2019re going to make our country so strong and so wonderful. And we all love it anyways. We love it. \nBut it\u2019s so sad to see what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s so sad. And we\u2019re going to change it around. \nQuestion on Common Core and education: \nYou know, I had an uncle who was a professor at MIT who was a brilliant guy...In fact, I just retweeted an article about him today. You\u2019ve got to read it. Okay? @RealDonaldTrump. You have to read it. \nWhen I see somebody like Jeb \u2013 no I\u2019ll tell you one thing I respect. He didn\u2019t change his views. He knew he was getting killed on this issue and he didn\u2019t change. And I respect that to a certain extent. But it\u2019s so wrong. \nCommon Core is a total disaster. We have people \u2013 bureaucrats in Washington \u2013 telling you how your child should be educated in Iowa and New Hampshire and all of the different places that we go to. It\u2019s ridiculous. \nAnd I go around and I\u2019ve seen the principals. I\u2019ve seen so many students and teachers and professors and principals, and I\u2019ve seen some of the people and the love \u2013 even in Iowa at a school \u2013 I\u2019ve seen some of the love these parents give to those schools. This is real love. These are smart people. And these are people that aren\u2019t working for a paycheck. These are incredible people... \nRemember this: Our educational system is a mess. We spend more money per pupil as a government than any other country in the world and we\u2019re in 28th place. And I mean like double what anybody else pays. \nSo I want to bring education back to the local areas. You\u2019re going to have parents and you\u2019re going to have unbelievably talented people and they love their kids and they want their kids to be well-educated because it\u2019s so important. And you\u2019re going to be very happy with it. Okay? Thank you. Thank you. \nQuestion on Republican establishment\u2019s opposition to Trump: \nOnce I said I\u2019m running, they said \u201cWhat? You\u2019re not supposed to run.\u201d \nAnd then what happened \u2013 I ran against all these Senators and Governors. And everyone said \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know.\u201d My wife said \u201cIf you run, you\u2019re going to win\u201d because she understands that I like people \u2013 I love people and people love me. And she said \u201cYou will run but you actually have to go and run. You have to announce you\u2019re running because nobody\u2019s going to believe you\u2019re running.\u201d \nAnd so I didn\u2019t want to announce because I didn\u2019t want to like announce and things didn\u2019t work out and I\u2019m like some of these guys where they\u2019re zero. Many of them zero. \nAnd so finally I said, \u201cLook, let\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re going to do it. We have to do it.\u201d \nJust too many things that I watch on television with our president and the decisions that are made \u2013 Bergdahl \u2013 where we get Bergdahl and they get five killers. We get this horrible, dirty rotten spy \u2013 horrible traitor. We get this horrible, terrible traitor and they get five killers that they\u2019ve wanted for nine years \u2013 the worst killers \u2013 and they\u2019re all back on the battlefield. \nYou know, so many decisions. The Iran deal. The Iran deal. How bad is that? They self-inspect. \u201cOkay, good. We\u2019re not building. We promise we\u2019re not building nuclear weapons.\u201d \u201cOh, okay. That\u2019s okay.\u201d \nAnd we give them $150 billion and we don\u2019t even get our prisoners back. The whole thing is crazy. So I saw this. And I said to my wife, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll do well or not. Who the hell knows?\u201d \nAnd it\u2019s a risky thing. And I\u2019ve always heard if you\u2019re a very successful person you can\u2019t run for office, especially for president, and I see it all the time. And the people go after me. I don\u2019t even care at this point. I said, \u201cI have to do it. Now, we\u2019re going to have to do it.\u201d \nAnd I look at it last time with Romney and I didn\u2019t do it and I probably should have because he let us down. I mean, look, he let us down. \nThat was an election \u2013 we had a failed president. Four years ago he was a failed president, just as bad as he is now. It\u2019s true. And Romney let us down. That last month \u2013 it was like he wasn\u2019t even campaigning. \nI said, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you on Jay Leno? Why aren\u2019t you on David Letterman? Why aren\u2019t you doing it?\u201d And he just didn\u2019t do it. So he lost the election. \nSo I backed McCain, he lost. I backed Romney, he lost. This time I said I\u2019m doing it myself, okay? We\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win. \nBut there is an establishment out there. It\u2019s a real establishment. Real people. And they\u2019re people that are used to having their little puppets all over the place. And they\u2019re people that are used to giving donations and having control. \nAnd they\u2019re people that, you know, look when they call me I\u2019ll treat them with respect but I\u2019m not going to be doing bad things if it\u2019s bad for the country. I\u2019m not going to let Ford build a plant in Mexico if I can keep it in Michigan. \nAnd I\u2019m not going to let the car companies and Nabisco and all these people and all these companies \u2013 I\u2019m all for free trade. I think it\u2019s great. I\u2019m for it. But it\u2019s got to be smart trade. I\u2019m not going to let them move to Mexico and then sell stuff over the border with no tax, no nothing so we lose our jobs, we lose our factories, they go over here, they make it, we let them come through. How does that help us, folks? I went to the best business school in the world. Believe me, it doesn\u2019t help us. Okay? Trust me. \nAnd we\u2019re not going to make deals like that anymore. We can\u2019t. We owe $19 trillion. We can\u2019t. \nSo the establishment is not ever probably \u2013 look, you know what? In the end, if this country starts humming even the establishment they\u2019ll be saying \u201cOkay, it\u2019s a good thing\u201d because they\u2019ll be beneficiaries also. \nBut we do have a real establishment and they\u2019ve never seen this happen before. \nA writer called up and he said recently \u2013 I told this story. I mean, one of the top journalists to my way of thinking certainly in the country and beyond. And he said, \u201cMr. Trump, how does it feel?\u201d I said, \u201cHow does what feel?\u201d \u201cHow does it feel? What you\u2019ve done has never, ever been done before?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve dominated the Summer of Trump.\u201d Now they call it the Autumn of Trump. \nHopefully, they\u2019re going to call it the Spring of Trump and I want the next Autumn of Trump. \nBut I said to the writer, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I haven\u2019t done anything \u2018cause frankly if I don\u2019t win I consider this to be a total waste of time.\u201d I\u2019ll be honest with you. As much as I like being with you tonight. Because we won\u2019t be able to do anything. \nHe said, \u201cNo, no. You\u2019ve won even if you don\u2019t win. You\u2019ve won already.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong. If I don\u2019t win, I have wasted my time.\u201d \nSo you know, the point is that the establishment can\u2019t believe it because they\u2019ve never seen it happen before. \n...I was on the cover of Time Magazine four or five weeks ago and Time Magazine was going to pick the Person of the Year. Everybody \u2013 even my enemies \u2013 said \u201cTrump is going to win.\u201d I said, \u201cI won\u2019t win.\u201d They said, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t win. Just like I should have gotten the Emmy for The Apprentice for the first three years. I was nominated. I should have.\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019ll never win.\u201d I told everybody I\u2019ll never win because I\u2019m not Hollywood establishment. \nAnd with Time Magazine, I said \u2013 Bill O\u2019Reilly, who\u2019s a great guy, did an editorial at the end of his show two days ago saying nobody has done more than Trump, he should have won. \nNow, I\u2019m not saying I should have \u2013 yeah, I probably should have in all fairness \u2013 but he said \u201cNobody\u2019s done more\u201d \u2013 you know, taking over \u2013 what we\u2019ve done has been amazing \u2013 all of us together not just me. It\u2019s all of us. It\u2019s all of us. From Dallas and Mobile and Oklahoma. All of us. Because the spirit. \n...Well, Merkel got it. Now, Merkel, what did she do? She\u2019s destroyed \u2013 I mean, she\u2019s in the process of destroying Germany with the migration. \nWe have to help the people with the migration. We have to create a safe zone some place in Syria. But I don\u2019t want them coming into this country. I don\u2019t want them because we don\u2019t know who they are. We don\u2019t know who they are. Them with their printing press that now do the forged passports. Okay? You heard about that. So we don\u2019t know. \nThe bottom line on that \u2013 it\u2019s such an interesting question. You\u2019ll know in about a month or two whether or not the establishment has treated me fairly. \nBut the only thing I can say is this: If I win Iowa, I think it\u2019s over. I said before. Because I think if I win Iowa, New Hampshire is amazing. People are amazing. You would love the people. They would love you. You\u2019d love everybody. The whole country is in love...I call it the noisy majority. It\u2019s no longer a silent majority. It\u2019s the noisy majority. \nBut if we win like I think we\u2019re going to win because we have such a big league, honestly, it\u2019s not going to matter. They can\u2019t do anything. I don\u2019t care about the establishment. They can\u2019t do anything. \nYou know, the only way they can do is if I\u2019m a little bit short, if I\u2019m two votes short I have a problem because I\u2019ll have to go into that convention, I\u2019m dealing with all these blood sucker politicians and they\u2019ll make their deals and they\u2019ll have all their money guys around and they\u2019ll be in the backroom making deals. \nBut if I get the number of delegates, there\u2019s not a thing they can do. And I\u2019ll end up doing fine with the establishment... \nQuestion on renewable fuel: \nAnd I\u2019m not. I\u2019m totally in favor. \nAnd you know, it\u2019s a big industry here. It\u2019s a big industry. \nYou know, if that industry is upset, Iowa\u2019s got problems. \nI was amazed. I was here three weeks ago with the group...They were such amazing people...And I learned so much about it. I was in favor of it even before... \n...Beyond even the fuel capacities, which we want to create as much as we can, tremendous numbers of jobs in Iowa. And I said to myself, if Ted Cruz is against ethanol, how does he win in Iowa? Because that\u2019s very anti-Iowa. I don\u2019t know how he wins in Iowa. I don\u2019t know. \nNo, but I\u2019m totally for it. Okay? Thank you. \nQuestion on Ted Cruz: \nAnd I would say that we would certainly have things in mind for Ted, to be honest with you. \nI mean, he\u2019s somebody that I can certainly see that because I like him, he likes me. He actually put out a tweet tonight. He said \u201cDonald Trump is\u201d \u2013 I think he used the word \u2013 \u201cterrific\u201d. That\u2019s a nice word. I mean, whoever hears that? \nI can tell you other candidates are not exactly saying that about me. Right? \nQuestion on campaign finance: \nBut then I got to be, you know, started going around and I see the corruption with these Super PACs, with the stuff towards money. People that put the money in are dealing with the candidates. The whole thing is wrong. \nAnd I see it. I mean, Bush has $125 million. Think of it. $125 million. By the way, if he had $2 billion it wouldn\u2019t make any difference. Okay? \nBut Bush has $125 million. And honestly, he\u2019s a nice person. He is. I don\u2019t want to do that but he\u2019s a very nice person. But it\u2019s $125 million. And you\u2019d say to yourself, \u201cPeople give $2 million, $5 million, $7 million. You know what\u2019s happening.\u201d \nBut some of the Super PACs are running campaigns. They\u2019re actually running the campaign. \nAnother thing and it\u2019s sort of interesting, one of the Super PACs I believe has $6 million. Of the $6 million \u2013 this was reported on the front page of the Los Angeles Times \u2013 one of the candidates who\u2019s a nice person so I\u2019m not going to mention the name. You know, when I like people I like them. I\u2019m a very loyal person. \nOf the $6 million after all of the bloodsuckers took their cuts, the fundraisers \u2013 can you believe this? \u2013 they had $140,000 left for the campaign. That\u2019s better than being a real estate broker. I\u2019d rather do that than sell houses. $140,000 left. That was in the newspaper. I don\u2019t know. I think I believe it. \nBut I\u2019ve seen it. I saw it with the Romney campaign. Guys made tens of millions of dollars raising money for Romney. I said what the hell is this? I mean, you give money and they get a cut. \nLook, our laws are so corrupt. Our campaign finance laws are so totally corrupt. It\u2019s so horrible. So horrible. \nAnd I don\u2019t necessarily want to stop people from giving because I think that\u2019s a good thing but you have to get away from these PACs. \nWhat you have to have is people have to know who it is. So you have to open up the process. Let people know. If somebody wants to give $1 million, you give $1 million but everybody has to know that so and so gave $1 million because that puts a little pressure on guys like Brad who raises hundreds of millions. Puts a little pressure. \nBut the concept of the PAC is no good. It\u2019s no good. It\u2019s a very dangerous, terrible thing. So we will change our laws because you really have no choice. It\u2019s so out of control. It\u2019s so terrible. \nBut the papers that are in this room tonight, they should look at this. There\u2019s so little money left over for the candidates, it\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m so happy I\u2019m doing my own. \nWe actually sent legal letters to either nine or 11 PACs. The Trump PAC, the Trump PAC, the this PAC. First of all, I\u2019m sure that out of some of them they stole the money. Some guy has no money. He sets up a Trump something PAC. Nothing to do with me. Sets it up. All of a sudden he\u2019s got $2 million sitting there. Right? People send in money. And that guy has no money. How much of that money do you think he\u2019s going to use to do what he\u2019s supposed to be doing? That\u2019s common sense. So maybe all of it but I doubt it. \nSo we sent legal notices to every one that we could find. We don\u2019t want their money. We said \u201cDon\u2019t do it. We don\u2019t want it. And we want ideally to give the money back to the people that gave it to you.\u201d \nBut the Super PAC concept is corrupt. It\u2019s terrible and it should be ended. And we\u2019re going to go to new campaign finance laws that are going to be terrific. Okay? Thank you. \nQuestion on gun control: \n...My sons are really great marksmen. They\u2019re big believers. And I\u2019m a member of the NRA but I\u2019m not such a good shot. But they\u2019re great shots so it\u2019s one of those things. \nBut if you think about that question. So you know there\u2019s tremendous pressure to get rid of the guns, get rid of the magazines, no bullets. How about the one where they have three bullets in every magazine? ...So the people will put three bullets in. I don\u2019t think the bad guys are going to say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to break the law. I\u2019m going to go kill people today but I\u2019m going to put three bullets in.\u201d Right? \nThese people \u2013 and you know I have arguments with them all the time and I\u2019m a practical guy. Honestly, if I didn\u2019t believe this, I couldn\u2019t say it. \nSo in France or in California, I have a permission to carry, which is a big thing in New York. It\u2019s very hard to get. I have a license to carry. \nBut in France or in California or in all these places where we see the shooters, right, if instead of having like in France hundreds of people in that room \u2013 Paris has the toughest gun laws in the world. France has the toughest gun laws in the world. Nobody has guns. Except the bad guys. \nSo they walk in with the worst, the toughest, the best weaponry you could have and they said, \u201cOver here \u2013 boom. Over here \u2013 boom.\u201d So they killed 128 but many more are dying right now. They\u2019re in terrible shape in the hospitals. They just wipe the place out and they could\u2019ve stayed there for longer. They wiped it out. \nThen you had those two sleaze bags from California. The married couple. I saw the press \u2013 \u201cThe young married couple that did the shooting\u201d. They\u2019re not a young married couple. They\u2019re the worst. They\u2019re sleaze. \n...They say \u201cThe young married couple\u201d. That\u2019s no young married couple. \nSo they walk into a place and they killed 14 people and others are going to be dying probably because of a lot of other wounded people. \nBut if somebody had guns in there \u2013 nobody had a gun...How would you have done if you had a gun? Would you have been firing back a little bit? They\u2019d been in trouble. Right? They would have been in trouble. Believe me. That guy. \nSo, you know, I went to like an Ivy League college and I have a lot of friends that are against guns and I argue with them. I talk to them. I said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re in Paris. You have all these places and there\u2019s hundreds of people. Guys walk in with guns and you have no gun. Don\u2019t you think they would\u2019ve been better if they had?\u201d They can\u2019t \u2013 they lose the argument but they never change their mind. \nSo we have to fight for the Second Amendment. It\u2019s so simple. It\u2019s so simple. \nAnd believe me, believe me, they want to take those guns away and you always know that the bad ones are going to have the guns and they\u2019re going to have them more so than ever before. So we\u2019re going to protect the Second Amendment if I\u2019m president. That I can tell you. \nAnd by the way, we\u2019re going to be saying Merry Christmas again. Do you ever notice? \n...And by the way, Merry Christmas everybody. Merry Christmas. And happy holiday. \nFrankly, I have a lot of friends that aren\u2019t Christian. They like Christmas. Everybody likes Christmas. It\u2019s politically incorrect to say Merry Christmas. But when I\u2019m president, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, enjoy yourselves, don\u2019t eat too much turkey. Right? \nOkay, so we\u2019re going to say Merry Christmas again folks. We\u2019re going to bring that spirit back. \nQuestion on Syrian refugees trying to sneak into the U.S. through the southern border: \nIt\u2019s not going to be \u2013 you see that ceiling? That ceiling is nothing compared to the wall. And we can build it and we can build it right. And it will be strong and powerful and as beautiful as a wall is going to look. It\u2019s got to be beautiful because someday they\u2019re going to name it the Trump Wall. I know that. It\u2019s going to happen. Going to happen. \nAnd it\u2019s going to work. And walls do work. \nYou know, they wanted to build a wall here 20 years ago. You know they couldn\u2019t get environmental impact statements. That\u2019s just shows you. \nChina is building in the South China Sea massive military bases. Right? Why? They\u2019re not supposed to. They have no respect for Obama or our country. They\u2019re not supposed to be doing that. And you could get them to stop just by saying \u201cWe\u2019re not doing business with you anymore.\u201d Their whole economy would \u2013 you don\u2019t have to go to war. It\u2019s economics. The whole country would collapse in two seconds. Believe me. We have such power and we don\u2019t know it. \nBut they\u2019re building massive \u2013 now, they had little islands. They put the biggest escavators, not Caterpillars. I think they\u2019re using Komatsu from Japan...They have these massive escavators, and I said to a friend of mine who\u2019s Chinese from China \u2013 very rich guy, very successful guy, paid me a fortune for an apartment so I happen to like him, okay? \u2013 I said jokingly \u201cHow long did it take them to do these massive islands they\u2019re building right out of the sea? Boom, those shovels go in, take out everything. How long did it take you to get the environmental impact statements?\u201d He laughed. He said, \u201cWhat are you kidding me? Nothing.\u201d They say \u201cWe will build there.\u201d About two seconds later, you have escavators digging. \nSo we had a problem with environmental \u2013 look, I\u2019ve won many environmental awards. I\u2019m a big believer especially in clean air and clean water. I\u2019m a big believer. Just so you know. Big. And I\u2019ve gotten so many awards for the environment. So I understand the environment; I\u2019ve won many, many awards. \nBut when you look at how we\u2019re impinged and hurt. But the wall was stopped because they couldn\u2019t get an environmental impact statement among other things. They couldn\u2019t get an environmental impact statement. \nNow, there was probably a snail or a turtle or a snake or something. You were ruining the habitat of a rattlesnake. I don\u2019t know. But they actually had people \u2013 a lot of people \u2013 people that now would be against it but they wanted to build a wall and years ago they couldn\u2019t get it done. \n...You know, I said bomb the oil, right? I\u2019ve been saying that for three years. Now finally they started \u2013 after Paris they started bombing the oil. I\u2019ve been saying it for years. \nYou know one of the reasons we didn\u2019t bomb the oil? Obama didn\u2019t want to hurt the environment. Now, I heard that and I thought somebody was kidding. I thought a comedian was saying it. It turned out to be true. He didn\u2019t want the flames and everything going into the atmosphere. This is the way we fight today. \nI\u2019m telling you, folks, we\u2019re being led by stupid people. We\u2019re being led by stupid people. \nI\u2019ve been saying not really bomb \u2013 I\u2019ve been saying take the oil. I didn\u2019t want to go into Iraq. But once we were there, I said \u201cLook, we shouldn\u2019t have been there. But then when we left, we left the wrong way.\u201d \nFirst of all, we have a president who told them a date. \u201cWe\u2019re going to leave on such and such a date.\u201d What was it like 18 months later? So the enemy all of sudden said, \u201cWow\u201d, \u2018cause don\u2019t believe it. They don\u2019t want to be killed. Okay? They don\u2019t want to be killed. So the enemy said \u201cThey\u2019re going to leave on a certain date?\u201d So they pulled back, the date comes, and now you see what happened. It\u2019s a disaster and Iran is taking over Iraq. \nSo anyway, I couldn\u2019t believe it when they said that. When we said to our 50 soldiers two weeks ago and our president gets up and announces \u201cWe are sending 50 soldiers.\u201d \nOkay, first of all, he thinks it\u2019s a good press announcement. It\u2019s not. 50 soldiers \u2013 that\u2019s not a lot even though they\u2019re the elite. But those 50 soldiers because of that announcement have a target on their heart. They have a target on their heart. \nWhy does he have to say that for? Why can\u2019t he let 50 soldiers go there quietly, stealth, stealth? Why can\u2019t he just do that? Why can\u2019t he do that? \nThose 50 soldiers are in grave danger today because of that, and they probably don\u2019t even know that but everybody is looking for them and that\u2019s the way it is. \nWe have people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. \nWe used to have General MacArthur \u2013 Douglas MacArthur \u2013 General George Patton. I mean, these were real people. These were real people. \nToday, we have generals that go on talk shows...I saw a general the other day on a talk show. He said \u2013 and this was serious and he\u2019s a good man. They\u2019re good men. But you\u2019ve got to lead these men. Even the generals have to have some power over them. He said, \u201cWe are in the worst shape in terms of preparedness that we\u2019ve been in in decades.\u201d And this is the time when we have to be in the best shape because the world wants to kill us. \nAnd he said we are in the worst shape we\u2019ve been in many, many decades. \nNow, number one, he shouldn\u2019t be saying that because you\u2019re telling the enemy that and the enemy feels embolden when they hear that. Right? We shouldn\u2019t be saying it. We shouldn\u2019t be saying it. \nI mean, even if it\u2019s true, you don\u2019t say it. You get it fixed and you do the opposite. \nOne thing I\u2019m going to do I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019m going to build our military so big and so strong and so powerful \u2013 so powerful that nobody is going to mess with us. Nobody is going to mess with us. \nYou know in many ways, it\u2019s the cheapest thing you can do. Everyone is toying with us right now. It\u2019s the cheapest thing you can do. The absolute cheapest thing you can do. \nBut they have bridges going up. We have rebuilt China. They\u2019ve taken our jobs. They\u2019ve taken our base. They\u2019ve taken our manufacturing all over the place. They\u2019ve taken our money. They\u2019ve taken our money. Not going to happen anymore folks. Not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen. \nI know the great business people. We have the greatest business people in the world. Guys like Carl Icahn. He calls me, \u201cDonald, I want to help. I want to help.\u201d The smartest people call. We\u2019re not going to use the special interest guy \u2013 a donor. \nWe use donors to negotiate with China because he gave some guy like, you know, whoever it might be. Because again, I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s self-funding my campaign. Everybody else isn\u2019t. \nThese guys \u2013 when these guys give money to politicians to a large extent they own those politicians. They will do whatever the hell the special interests and the donors want. \nThat\u2019s not going to happen with me. \nSo, Social Security \u2013 we\u2019re saving it. Medicare \u2013 we\u2019re saving it. We\u2019re going to make our country rich. Okay? Thank you, sweetheart. \nQuestion on Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails: \nLook, Hillary Clinton \u2013 you know this story. It\u2019s a crime. She committed a crime. \nNow, perhaps \u2013 perhaps \u2013 somebody, you know, we have to have a fair Justice Department and perhaps...we\u2019ll have some really good Attorney General that\u2019s going to say \u201cWell, you know\u201d. \nLook, we want to be fair to everybody. Okay? Including Hillary Clinton. But she committed a crime in my opinion. \nNow, she shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run. She\u2019s being protected absolutely. I have little doubt that they\u2019re going to find anything. But they\u2019ve already found it. \nI mean, you watch television. You have all these big scholars, these lawyers, \u201cYes, she violated section so and so\u201d. Just one after another. I mean, actually violated many, many laws, not just like a little one here. Many laws. \nYou mentioned General Petraeus. His life was destroyed over 5% of what Hillary Clinton did. Over nothing. \nSo I think she\u2019s going to be their nominee definitely. The only question is whether or not she\u2019ll be allowed to run. She\u2019s being protected by the Democrats. She\u2019s being protected by the President. And that\u2019s why \u2013 why do you think she\u2019s going along with these insane policies of his? Okay? I mean, she goes along with everything. \nI don\u2019t even \u2013 honestly in all fairness to her, I don\u2019t think she believes it. But I think she\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to say, \u201cListen, I don\u2019t like her anymore. Go take care of her. I\u2019m going to get somebody else.\u201d I\u2019m telling you. \nSo, the question is statute of limitations. It\u2019s a five year statute of limitations. She\u2019s got a problem. She\u2019s got a problem. In one way, she\u2019s running for her life because I know one thing, if she wins that\u2019s the end of that. Right? But if she loses she could have a very serious problem. \n...We just did a big interview with CNN just before this. And you know, Hillary \u2013 was Hillary missing today? What happened? She was two hours late. No, did you hear? \nNow, I may be wrong. If I\u2019m one minute off, they\u2019ll call me because they love Hillary. They love her. You know why. I don\u2019t know why. Why? I\u2019m trying to figure it. No, I heard she was a couple of hours late. Everybody left. You know what happened? She was sleeping. I\u2019m telling you. She couldn\u2019t get out of bed. She was sleeping. She was sleeping. Was right. \nQuestion on Social Security reform: \nBut we\u2019re not going to cut your Social Security and we\u2019re not cutting your Medicare. We\u2019re going to take jobs back from all these countries that are ripping us off. We\u2019re going to become a wealthy country again. And we\u2019re going to be able to save your Social Security. \n...I can\u2019t believe this number but I read it over \u2013 who is the man that told me the number \u2013 over 6 million people \u2013 I can\u2019t believe it \u2013 are aged 112 and over are getting Social Security...But I heard it. I read it. A tremendous \u2013 like 6 million people are getting Social Security. They\u2019re dead. Meaning somebody else is picking up... \n...The press is going to have to check it because what do I know? But can you imagine, we have 6 million \u2013 now, we know there\u2019s not 6 million, there may be one. But there\u2019s not 6 million. \nAnybody in this room 112 or over? Because if they are, I want to shake your hand. \nBut \u2013 so 6 million over 112 years old picking up Social Security and that\u2019s the beginning. So there\u2019s tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse. \nWhat we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to save Medicare. We\u2019re going to save Social Security. We\u2019re not going to raise the age or we\u2019re not going to do all the things that everyone else is talking about doing. They\u2019re all talking about doing it, and you don\u2019t have to. We\u2019re going to bring our jobs back. We\u2019re going to make our economy incredible again. \nMy tax proposal, which is in, and a great detail in terms of policy and it\u2019s gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people, a lot of great groups. \nBut we are going to cut taxes tremendously for the middle class and for businesses because our middle class is being decimated. \nAnd when that happens, you\u2019re going to see an economy that takes off. We\u2019re going to get rid of a lot of that debt, if not all of it. But we\u2019re going to get rid of it \u2013 you know, we\u2019re at $19 trillion going t $21 trillion right. \nYou know, if you go back eight or nine years, trillion wasn\u2019t even a word anybody knew and now it\u2019s like routine. \nSo we are going to save your Social Security without cuts. We\u2019re going to bring the economy back. We\u2019re going to make ourselves rich again. \nA woman said to me in New Hampshire recently, she said, \u201cMr. Trump, I\u2019m voting for you. I love you. But it\u2019s very crude when you say you\u2019re going to make our country rich again.\u201d I said, \u201cI know it\u2019s crude. It sounds bad. But many things I say are crude. It sounds bad. But we can\u2019t make our country great again unless we make our country rich again. We can\u2019t let everybody in the world rip us off.\u201d \nNow, I could put less pressure on myself and I could say, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t care about Iowa. I don\u2019t care.\u201d But I do care. I do care so much about it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here all the time. \nAnd then the lies happened. You know, when I was using Iowa, they lied so much. I said, \u201cThe people of Iowa can\u2019t be that stupid or the people of the country can\u2019t \u2013 \u201c. I\u2019m trying to make a point, right? So I said, \u201cThe people of the country can\u2019t be that stupid.\u201d Well, they cut the \u201ccountry\u201d out so it\u2019s referring to Iowa. \nI love you people. Remember that. Remember that. \nI was talking about something, and I won\u2019t even mention what I\u2019m talking about because the guy I\u2019m talking about and was actually a very good guy. \nBut I will say this. We want to win Iowa so bad. Because if I win Iowa, I think we\u2019d run the table. I really do. I think we\u2019d run the table. We\u2019d go right through. \nBecause we\u2019re leading big in New Hampshire \u2013 every poll. Big. Big in New Hampshire. Christie got an endorsement from this crazy newspaper up there. It\u2019s the weirdest deal I\u2019ve ever seen. \nAnd you know the paper that was in his state called up and said, \u201cAre you sure about that? Nobody ever called us.\u201d They can\u2019t believe it. And we can get into that but it\u2019s irrelevant. \nBut we\u2019re leading New Hampshire big. We\u2019re leading in South Carolina like monstrous numbers. We\u2019re leading...Nevada. We\u2019re leading in Texas. We\u2019re leading everywhere. We\u2019re leading big in Florida. \nNow, you have Rubio \u2013 nice guy, by the way. You have Rubio and he is a nice guy but you\u2019ve got to vote. When people put you in a position to be a Senator, you\u2019ve got to go and vote. You can\u2019t be the number one person that doesn\u2019t vote in the Senate. You\u2019ve got to say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m a young guy. I want to go and vote.\u201d You should stay there a little longer. He\u2019s a good guy. Stay there, go in, vote, create a nice record. \nBut I don\u2019t know. How\u2019s he doing in Iowa? Not too good. Right? He\u2019s not doing well. How\u2019s Rubio doing? Not good. \nI mean, it seems like a two-person race right now...and it\u2019s an important race to me. So I just want to let you know it\u2019s very important. \nSo with all of that, if we win Iowa, a lot of people say we\u2019d just go through. I think we\u2019ll win virtually every state in the Union and it\u2019s over quickly. Over quickly. \n...What about the Republican establishment? The establishment\u2019s got a problem, you know. It\u2019s sort of like the fighters. You know, the great champions. Sometimes they\u2019ll go into the hometown of a guy they\u2019re fighting and they\u2019ll say, \u201cYou know, we\u2019d never want to get a decision. We go for the knock-out. The knock-out is the knock-out.\u201d Because you get a lot of bad decisions. I know a lot about the world of sports, believe me, and they go into a hometown to fight and it\u2019s a decision and they say, \u201cUh, we\u2019re in a problem\u201d and they\u2019d lose the fight that they won. The only way they win the fight definitely \u2013 knock out. \nSo, if we win Iowa, I think we\u2019re going to win everything after that. So I think it\u2019s going to show how important Iowa is. \n...I\u2019ll pledge this to Iowa. Even if I lose, I\u2019ll pledge it, okay? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever said that in my life. If we go and win, Iowa\u2019s staying right where it is in the chain. It\u2019s not moving. You know, there\u2019s a big move to move Iowa into a much further back position by the establishment. Folks, I win it\u2019s not happening, okay? You\u2019re staying right here because it\u2019s great. It\u2019s great. \nI\u2019ll tell you, you have one of the most dishonest right here in your backyard. The Des Moines Register is the worst. They are the worst. The worst. No, they\u2019re very dishonest. \nYou have some reporter named Jacobs. She is the worst. She will write \u2013 so \u2013 it\u2019s such misrepresentation. And so I don\u2019t care. I mean, who cares? So I\u2019m saying it right in their backyard. They\u2019re failing anyway. They probably won\u2019t be in business in two years. I think they\u2019re losing a fortune. I think. \nYou know, it\u2019s funny. Every time the Des Moines Register does a poll, I always do badly. \n...I\u2019m only doing this so they don\u2019t sue me but I don\u2019t mind if they do. I hope they sue me because they don\u2019t have enough money to sue me. That\u2019s the good thing. \nBut I believe and I may be wrong \u2013 in fact, I\u2019ll say I\u2019m sure I\u2019m wrong but it\u2019s my opinion that they don\u2019t do it properly because you know they poll like 300 or 400 people. I\u2019ll explain it...You know, if they lose 20 people in the pocket. \u201cOh, Trump? Oh, forget that one. Forget that one.\u201d \nNow, I don\u2019t know that they do that. Do you do that, Des Moines Register? \nBut every time I have a Des Moines Register poll, I do poorly. I also do poorly with the Bloomberg polls. I don\u2019t know why. \nBut we had a great poll come in \u2013 CNN last couple of days \u2013 where we\u2019re leading I think by 13 points in Iowa. In Iowa. \nAnd then we have another coming where we\u2019re doing well. \nBut I think Des Moines Register has somebody says it\u2019s coming out sometime. I\u2019ll just tell you, watch \u2013 \u201cTrump disappears!\u201d \nI think we\u2019re going to do so well. I think we\u2019re actually going to even do better. You know, we\u2019re leading in most of the poll. We\u2019re leading in every poll. \nExcept Iowa there was one poll \u2013 there was one poll, Monmouth \u2013 I\u2019d never even heard Monmouth. What the hell is Monmouth? What is Monmouth? Explain it. I don\u2019t like Monmouth. You know why I don\u2019t like it? Because they always treat me badly also. \nBut I only like polls that treat me well. \nBut we\u2019re doing so well. Nationwide, we\u2019re leading every poll by tremendous. We just had one in Georgia \u2013 44%. 44%. Think of that. That\u2019s 44% with 15 people. I\u2019d take 44% if we had three people. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d take it if we had two people but I think I\u2019d take if we had three. But 44%. \nCBS came out as you know, you probably saw that, New York Times two days ago and we\u2019re at 35% to a small number. We\u2019re killing everybody in every poll. Just one little outlier here. \n...Again, I\u2019m sure when Des Moines comes out it\u2019ll be a negative because I don\u2019t believe that poll. \nBut we are going to win. And I\u2019ll tell you what. Honestly, Iowa is so important to me. I could say, \u201cOh, let\u2019s not do\u201d \u2013 I am an evangelical. I am a Christian. I\u2019m a Presbyterian. I\u2019m a Presbyterian. I love Billy Graham. \nFranklin Graham came out with the most beautiful statements. Franklin Graham. He was so incredible. He came out \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you all saw the statements he came out with about Trump...He was so incredible. Franklin Graham was amazing, the son of Billy Graham, who was, you know, there\u2019s nobody, nobody that I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 Billy Graham was unbelievable. If anybody\u2019s gone to his crusades, they were incredible. \nBut so I think we\u2019re going to do \u2013 we\u2019re doing really well with the evangelicals... \nAnd by the way and again, I do like Ted Cruz but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba in all fairness. It\u2019s true. Not a lot come out. But I like him nevertheless. \nI think we\u2019re going to do great and we are doing great with evangelicals. We\u2019re doing great with the Tea Party, leading with the Tea Party. \nAnd we\u2019re doing fantastic with all the young and middle. We\u2019re doing great with everybody. \nAnd so it\u2019s very important for me to win Iowa. \nBelieve me, I can take care of China in my back pocket. That\u2019s easy for me. That\u2019s what I do. \nAnd we have all the cards. A lot of people don\u2019t know. You know, these politicians they don\u2019t understand we have the cards. \nYou know, with China, our people pay tax. They pay no tax. It\u2019s not supposed to be that way. They call it a tariff because it sounds better. But we\u2019ll take care of that. We\u2019ll take care of all of that. \nWhat happened is with Paris, there\u2019s a different mindset. \nAnd when the polls came out last week, my numbers went way up because people felt more secure with me. \nNow, maybe it had to do \u2013 who knows why? Who knows? \nBut my poll numbers went up. And do you ever notice whenever there\u2019s something that I do that\u2019s proper but controversial, they\u2019d say \u201cOh, now he\u2019s gone. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the end.\u201d \nI won\u2019t go over all of the different things because maybe you\u2019ll change your minds. \nBut they\u2019d say, \u201cThat\u2019s it. It\u2019s over.\u201d \nAnd then they\u2019d come in, \u201cSir, your poll number went up 9 points this week.\u201d I said, \u201cThey did?\u201d Because I have to do what\u2019s right. I have to do what\u2019s right. \nAnd you know what? If I don\u2019t make it, I don\u2019t make it. \nI have a good life. We all hopefully have a good life. I have a great family, nice people, wonderful people. They love me. I think. I hope. I think. But I have a great family and I built a great business. \n...There\u2019s such spirit...There\u2019s such spirit no matter where I go. You know, I go to Dallas. We have 20,000. 35,000 people in Mobile, Alabama. 20,000 people in Oklahoma. Wherever we go in Iowa, we have these crowds. You know this is supposed to be...for like a record. \nIt is big and yet it feels intimate. It feels good... \n...So I changed a couple of weeks ago. When I saw Paris I changed. And a big, big part of what I\u2019m doing now is safety and security and smartness and smartness. \nSort of interesting. You know, the slogan is \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d and I\u2019m adding \u201cMake America Great Again and Safe Again\u201d because we don\u2019t feel safe anymore. \nAnd the problem we have now that we\u2019ve never had to this extent is the power of weaponry. It\u2019s the power. It\u2019s the tremendous power. \nYou know, 100 years ago, I would have said \u201cLet\u2019s not go.\u201d I said \u201cDon\u2019t go there\u201d anyway. And I said it strongly \u201cDon\u2019t go. You\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East.\u201d \nBut the fact is right now, we\u2019re going to have to do things because we have some really, really sick degenerates. \nAnd the press \u2013 look at all those cameras going all live, all \u2013 you know, nobody else has cameras like this. They can make a speech 100 times they make a speech, nobody cares. Look at this. \nAnd don\u2019t worry, they never pan the crowd. You know, they never; they have me. That\u2019s why I\u2019m walking around. I figured I\u2019ll walk around maybe they\u2019ll get the crowd. They never pan the crowd. I tell them \u201cPan the crowd\u201d, they never do. \n...I had a crowd 7,000 people last week. More. 7,000 people and in a confined space. They had 3,000 people outside that couldn\u2019t get in. My wife says, \u201cDarling, the speech was excellent. Did you have many people there?\u201d I said \u201cWhat?\u201d She said, \u201cWell, they never leave your face.\u201d They keep it purposely. But I\u2019ll tell you the cameras may be a little screwed up where you can\u2019t move them, right? \nBut every time there\u2019s a protester \u201cWell, I\u2019m protesting\u201d and it can be in the back lefthand corner of the room, the cameras swoop over there. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. \nNo, I used to think they couldn\u2019t move. You know, maybe there\u2019s something with the crazy computers. \nYou know, in the old days everything was better right? The car seats. You\u2019d sit in your car and you want to move forward and back, you press a button. Bing, bing. Now, you have to open up things, press a computer, takes you 15 minutes. \nWell, the same thing I figured with cameras. I didn\u2019t think they moved. I figured they were fixed for certain reasons. And then I saw a protester and those cameras were bent in positions like you wouldn\u2019t believe possible. \nSo, they\u2019re very dishonest people. What can I say? Not all of them but most of them. \n...We\u2019re doing really well. Iowa\u2019s been amazing. It\u2019s been amazing. We\u2019re doing so well and I love this place and I\u2019m back here all the time and I\u2019m going to be here a lot in January. \nYou\u2019re going to be so sick of me. You\u2019ll probably say, \u201cWe can\u2019t give \u2013 the caucus, just forget it. We can\u2019t stand the guy any more.\u201d \nNo, you\u2019re going to like me and we\u2019re going to be back and we\u2019re going to do a great job for you. Most importantly, we\u2019re going to get to that office and we\u2019re going to do the right thing. We\u2019re going to do the right thing. \nSo, a few things. A lot \u2013 so much has happened. \nYou know, when we first came out, we were all talking together. And we were talking border security, which we\u2019re just doing so great with the border security. \nWe\u2019re going to build a wall. Mexico\u2019s going to pay for the wall. We all know that. But we\u2019re going to have security. And the drugs are going to stop and the people that are going to come into the country but they\u2019re going to come into the country they\u2019re going to be legal, they\u2019re coming in legally, and that\u2019s the way. That\u2019s the way. \nAnd it affects Iowa so much. \nSo we were talking about. So we were talking about that. We were talking about repealing Obamacare. Boom. It\u2019s going to be repealed. It\u2019s going to be replaced. \nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been seeing what\u2019s happening but Obamacare is a total disaster. It\u2019s dying of its own weight. \nAnd by \u201917, meaning he\u2019ll be playing golf and I\u2019ll be working very hard. But \u201917 instead you\u2019re not getting the people signed up. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about it and a lot of stories about it. \nObamacare\u2019s dead but we\u2019ll terminate it quicker than that. \nAnd we will come up with something that will be so good, so much better. \nPremiums are going through the roof. Deductibles are so high that unless you\u2019re close to death, you\u2019ll never going to get to use. And even then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get to use it really. \nSo, we\u2019re going to take care of that. \nAnd by the way, we have a lot of good people. We have ethanol. Nobody is really \u2013 we have the ethanol \u2013 where are the ethanol people? Right? \nI was here a month ago and I met with them all and they do a fantastic job. I toured the plants and they do a fantastic job but it\u2019s so important. And it\u2019s another form of let\u2019s stay away from OPEC and let\u2019s stay away from that Middle East stuff. It\u2019s so important... \nActually what I don\u2019t understand because the one guy that\u2019s doing pretty good with me in Iowa is Ted Cruz and he\u2019s a nice guy. I mean, everything I say he agrees with me. No matter what I say. \nI was going to do one really wild but he agrees. \nBut with the ethanol, really, he\u2019s got to come a long way because he\u2019s right now for the oil. \nBut I understand it. Oil pays him a lot of money. He\u2019s got to be for oil, right? The oil companies give him a lot of money. \nBut I\u2019m with you. I\u2019m with everybody. Look, I\u2019m self funding. I have no oil company. I have no special interest. I have no lobbyist that want me and you know, they\u2019re representing countries that are ripping off the country, they\u2019re representing companies that are ripping off our country. \nAll I do is I\u2019m going to be working for you folks. We\u2019re going to do this thing together. We\u2019re going to make America so great again and maybe better than ever before. So important. \nSo when we first started, I talked about China how they\u2019re ripping us and Japan and Mexico. \nMexico both at the border and in trade. They\u2019re taking so many of our companies. Nabisco\u2019s moving there with their big plant. Ford is moving there with a big plant. They took a big plant away from Tennessee \u2013 a great state \u2013 they took it away at the last moment. \nI\u2019m not going to let that stuff. We\u2019re going to do what we have to do, okay? \nBut I talked about that...and I talk about it a lot. The fact is that about 2.5 weeks ago with Paris, I\u2019m speaking a little bit differently now. "}, {"name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at the 2015 Family Leadership Summit in Iowa", "text": "Frank Luntz: \n...What is your relationship with God? \nFrank Luntz: \nDid God help you do these great deals? \nAnd essentially, Frank, look, when you boil it down, we need a President that\u2019s going to be able to make deals \u2013 great deals \u2013 because we\u2019re getting killed. We\u2019re losing \u2013 our gross national product went down. Our GDP if you look at it \u2013 gross domestic \u2013 went down in the first quarter. It became negative. \nWhen China goes up 7% or 8%, I saw the other day, China went up 7%. It was like in China they\u2019re going crazy. How can it only go up \u2013 we had a negative. Think of it. We had a negative number. It\u2019s unheard of. \nGDP goes down fairly substantially. And I think it\u2019s going to continue to go down. \nThat means we\u2019re getting smaller and yet we have more people many of which pour across our border by the way. \nWe need somebody that can take our jobs back from China. We need somebody that can take our jobs back from Mexico. We need somebody that can take our jobs back because we\u2019re going to hell. Our country\u2019s going to hell...We\u2019re going to hell and we need somebody that\u2019s going to be able to bring our jobs back. \nFrank Luntz: \n...Leaders are required to set priorities. Is our economic health or our moral health more important for the next President to prioritize? \nLook, if I\u2019m elected President, I know everybody. They can\u2019t create jobs like me. Nobody\u2019s going to be close. They can\u2019t negotiate with China like I can negotiate. \nAnd by the way, every single other country in the world, we don\u2019t make good deals anymore. \nIf I can make the country strong financially, it\u2019s a lot easier for the country morally. I mean our country \u2013 you look at what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re in serious trouble. \nOur military is \u2013 we\u2019ve sent weapons over to our so-called allies and one shot\u2019s fired and we lose 2,300 humvees, armored plated. I mean, we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. We truly don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. \nIf I can make our country really strong, I would focus on the military. \nI tell you what I\u2019d focus on the vets. I love the vets. The vets are treated like fourth class citizens in this country. \nAnd that\u2019s part of the morality. These guys went out. These people went out and they fought for us and they\u2019re great people. The best people. And they\u2019re treated so badly. \nI\u2019ve been with vets where they say they go to a doctor\u2019s office in one of the places and they\u2019ll wait four to five days in a reception area before they can even see a doctor. That\u2019s morality too and that\u2019s very bad morality. \nI think your question is very good but I think they have to go hand in hand because our country\u2019s a debtor nation. We\u2019re in serious trouble. And we\u2019ve got to make us \u2013 I know it sounds a little bit rough \u2013 we\u2019ve got to make our country rich again. We have to make our country great again. \nWe can\u2019t let other parts of the world steal our country, steal our jobs, steal our manufacturing. \nWith that being said, the morality of this country with the right President. \nPresident Obama, I\u2019d never thought he would be a good President because I didn\u2019t think he was qualified. But I thought one thing that he would do, he would be a great cheerleader for the country. He\u2019s been horrible... I don\u2019t know if he loves America. I hope he loves America... \nFrank Luntz: \nIs he a moral President? \nBut you know what? I was hoping and I thought \u2013 the one thing I thought about him \u2013 I saw him speaking in Germany. I saw him speaking. I thought he\u2019d be a good cheerleader for the country. He\u2019s been horrible. He\u2019s been divisive. He\u2019s been horrible. \nHe hasn\u2019t even called Kate Steinle\u2019s family who got killed. He calls other people. But he hasn\u2019t called the family of Kate Steinle. Why wouldn\u2019t he call her? And this was a man that came over, was pushed over from Mexico. Five different \u2013 he shouldn\u2019t have been here. An illegal immigrant. And nobody\u2019s even called her family. Okay? \nI think morality and I think success go hand in hand. You don\u2019t have to have one without the other. \nFrank Luntz: \nDid you used to have dinner with your kids most nights? \nBut I was always available to my children. And frankly, I\u2019ve said it \u2013 I was actually a great father. I was a better father than I was a husband. \nAnd the reason is I was a worker. And you mentioned the relationships and they were very good women. But I was always working. I was working. I was creating jobs. I was building jobs. I was doing everything. Legitimate stuff. I was working and it was very hard for a woman. And I blame myself; I don\u2019t blame anybody else. But it was a work thing. It wasn\u2019t a bad thing. \nAnd it was very hard for anybody to compete against the work and that was not good. I\u2019ve learned that. \nFrank Luntz: \n...When you try to prioritize your career or your family, what is the best way to get that right? \nBy the way, same with Mexico. Love Mexico. Love the Mexican people. Thousands of them work for me. They\u2019re incredible. I just don\u2019t like that the Mexican leaders are ripping off our country because they\u2019re smarter and more cunning than our leaders and our negotiators. You know, between the trade and the border, they\u2019re killing us. \nFrank Luntz:\n...So career and family. How do you balance? \nI know the richest people in the world. I know the toughest people in the world. I know these people; they\u2019re brutal and you wouldn\u2019t like them and they probably wouldn\u2019t like you very much. These are brutal people. Great negotiators. Great business people. But not nice people. They\u2019re not the happiest people. They\u2019re very rich. They\u2019re very smart. I would use them to negotiate against Japan...But I will tell you they\u2019re not the happiest people. \nThe happiest people I see are the people that have great families. Whatever it is, I mean, I don\u2019t know. \nAnd just to take that a step further \u2013 and I tell this people all the time \u2013 they say, \u201cHow do I get rich, Mr. Trump? How do I get rich?\u201d And they have a good family. I tell them all the time and I make this statement because I\u2019ve seen it \u2013 those people that have that great family \u2013 wife, husband, children, whatever it takes \u2013 those are the people that in my life I\u2019ve seen are the happiest people. \nA lot of the really successful people are \u2013 they always want more, more. They could have $2 billion; they want $6 billion. Then they want to get up to the $10 billion. But they always want more, more. And in the end, they\u2019re not very happy people. \nSo I don\u2019t know it\u2019s a great thing. \nReligion is a very big factor too. I\u2019ve seen people that are \u2013 have a great family and they have God and they have church and they love their church. I have friends who love to go to their church and help their church. They\u2019re happy people. \nQuestion: \nRespectfully, we remember the 1992 election. Ross Perot cost us that election. Would you go on record today in saying that if you can\u2019t get the Republican nomination, you will not run as a third-party candidate? \nLook, I want this country \u2013 this country has great potential. But soon it\u2019s not going to have that potential because we\u2019re being drained by incompetent leaders, by horrible people. \nAs an example, with the Iran deal, which is a total disaster, we didn\u2019t get our four hostages back. That\u2019s just one aspect of it. \nAnd just this morning and yesterday Secretary [John] Kerry, who\u2019s the worst \u2013 the worst negotiator. I mean, he didn\u2019t read the Art of the Deal, folks. So Secretary Kerry, he said very strongly \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to bring up the hostages. We didn\u2019t want to complicate our deal.\u201d \n...We want our hostages back. How is that complicating a deal? Right? \nWe gave them money. We didn\u2019t \u2013 so he didn\u2019t want to talk about the money. He didn\u2019t want to talk about the hostage. \nIt was just announced that Iran got one of their leading nuclear scientists back as part of the deal. Just came out this morning. \nSo Iran, in addition to making an unbelievable deal that\u2019s going to make them one of the great powers, perhaps more powerful than the United States because today it\u2019s about the weapons not about the number of soldiers you have. \n...We\u2019re giving them billions and billions of dollars that we shouldn\u2019t be giving them. We didn\u2019t get our hostages back, which is terrible because they didn\u2019t want to complicate \u2013 we didn\u2019t want to complicate the negotiations. \nAnd when Obama was asked about that question the other day by Major \u2013 he was asked a very simple question \u2013 the anger in his face of being asked that question and he said \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to complicate.\u201d \nHow is it complicated? Except for one problem. Iran just got their big scientist back and we just found out about it this morning. \nI think we are run by a group of incompetent people and they\u2019re destroying our country. \nAnd just one other thing, nobody deals with politicians more than I did. I\u2019ve contributed to everybody. They did whatever I said. Everybody. \nI contributed to Hillary Clinton. I contributed to Bill. I contributed to everybody. \nAnd you know what? I was a businessman. Why wouldn\u2019t I? I don\u2019t have to agree with them. \nI know this like with my wedding. I said, \u201cHillary, Bill, be at my wedding.\u201d They were at my wedding. That was very nice. Okay? Because I contribute. \n...But as a businessman you have other things and you have other things to do. So I\u2019m very proud of a record. No politician in my opinion \u2013 I know them all, I watch them. They talk about the moon and the sun. The sun will rise and the moon will set. I watch them. People want jobs. No politician is going to get this country back. \nI\u2019m sort of a politician because I\u2019ve been dealing with politicians all my life. \nIf you can\u2019t win and make a lot of money with politicians, you\u2019re not very good. Believe me. I\u2019ve been dealing with them all my life and I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s dealt with them any better. I know them. \nAnd I know it from the other side. All of the people, like when you see Bush has $100 million and you see Hillary has $50 million that they got, they just announced, those people are controlled by those people that gave them money. They\u2019re lobbyists. They\u2019re special interests. And they\u2019re donors. \nAnd I will tell you that they are totally controlled. \nAnd when Bush has to make a decision \u2013 and can you imagine this guy negotiating against China? We have no chance, okay? Who would you rather have negotiating against China? Trump or Bush? You tell me. \nQuestion: \nI was wondering how your faith and your family growing up has influenced how you raised your children?  \nAnd more than any other question, I get from people is \u201cHow did you raise your kids?\u201d Because you know you read so many horror stories about children. \nAnd one of them was through the church \u2013 very important. We have a church where I grew up \u2013 First Presbyterian Church in Queens \u2013 in Jamaica, Queens \u2013 and that\u2019s where I grew up and that\u2019s where I did went to church. I go to Sunday. I go to Bible class. I did all the things that a lot of the folks in this room did. \nChurch was a very important element as far as growing the kids. \nAnd the other important element was I would from the time they\u2019re two-years-old say, \u201cNo drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes.\u201d \nAnd Ivanka, I remember, her looking at me once, \u201cDaddy, you\u2019re driving me crazy.\u201d The kid was like four-years-old. She didn\u2019t even know what drugs are. \nBut I would constantly \u2013 because I\u2019ve seen so many children grow up and they get under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and their parents are brilliant people, they\u2019re successful people. The kid is brilliant. They have no chance. They have no chance. \nOnce they\u2019re under the influence of the drugs and the alcohol, life is too tough, they\u2019re not going to make it. \nSo I was very strong with my children, \u201cNo drugs, no alcohol\u201d, and I threw in cigarettes. \nFrank Luntz: \n...But referring to people as rapists, referring to John McCain \u2013 a war hero \u2013 five-and-a-half years as a POW and you call him a dummy. Is that appropriate in running for President? \nWe move it to the Convention Center. We have 15,000 people. The biggest one ever. Bigger than Bernie Sanders. 15,000 people showed up to hear me speak. Bigger than anybody and everybody knows it. \nA beautiful day with incredible people that were wonderful, great Americans. I will tell you. \nJohn McCain goes, \u201cOh boy, Trump makes my life difficult. He had 15,000 crazies show up.\u201d Crazies \u2013 he called them all crazy. \nI said, \u201cThey weren\u2019t crazy. They were great Americans.\u201d \nThese people \u2013 if you were to see these people, you \u2013 I know what a crazy is. I know all about crazies. These weren\u2019t crazies. \nSo he insulted me and he insulted everybody in that room. And I said, \u201cSomebody should run against John McCain who has been, in my opinion, not so hot.\u201d And I supported him. I supported him for President. I raised $1 million for him. It\u2019s a lot of money. I supported him. He lost. He let us down. But you know he lost. So I never liked him as much after that because I don\u2019t like loser. \nFrank Luntz: \nBut he\u2019s a war hero...[overlapping audio]\n \nAnd I believe perhaps he\u2019s a war hero but right now he said some very bad things about a lot of people. \nSo what I said is John McCain, I disagree with him that these people aren\u2019t crazy and very importantly \u2013 and I speak the truth \u2013 he graduated last in his class at Annapolis. So I said, nobody knows that \u2013 I said he graduated last or second to last \u2013 he graduated last in his class at Annapolis. \nAnd he was upset. I said, \u201cWhy? For telling the truth?\u201d \nSee, you\u2019re not supposed to say that somebody graduated last or second to last in their class because you\u2019re supposed to be like friends as very nice. \nFolks, I want to make America great again. We want to get down to brass tacks. We don\u2019t want to listen to his stuff with being politically correct. We have a lot of work to do. \nFrank, the other day Hillary Clinton got up and she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t like Mr. Trump\u2019s tone.\u201d We have people \u2013 Christians \u2013 having their heads cut off in the Middle East. We have people dying all over the border where I was right \u2013 100% right. We have all of this like Medieval Times. And she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t like his tone.\u201d \nAnd you know who else said that? Jeb Bush. \u201cI didn\u2019t like his tone.\u201d \nWhat does it have to do with tone? We want results. This group wants results. We don\u2019t want tone. \nFrank Luntz: \n...You used the word Christian. Have you ever asked God for forgiveness? \nEverybody\u2019s heard of Norman Vincent Peale? He was so great. He would give a sermon; you\u2019d never wanted to leave. Sometimes we had sermons and every once in a while we think about leaving a little early, right, even though we\u2019re Christian. \nDr. Norman Vincent Peale, Frank, would give a sermon \u2013 I\u2019m telling you, I still remember his sermons. It was unbelievable. And what he would do is he would bring real life situations \u2013 modern day situations \u2013 into the sermon. And you could listen to him all day long. \nWhen you left the church, you were disappointed that it was over. He was the greatest guy... \nFrank Luntz: \nBut have you ever asked God for forgiveness? \nWhen we go to church and when I drink my little wine, which is about the only wine I drink, and have my little cracker, I guess that\u2019s a form of asking for forgiveness. And I do as often as possible because I feel cleansed. But to me that\u2019s important I do that. \nBut in terms of officially, I could say absolutely...I don\u2019t think in terms of that. I think in terms of let\u2019s go on and let\u2019s make it right. \nFrank Luntz: \n...Common Core has been very controversial. The President\u2019s had to step back on it. What should the next President do with Common Core and with education so that you can hire the employees that you want to hire? \nFrank Luntz: \nBut don\u2019t we go too far? Don\u2019t you feel you went too far in what you called Mexicans coming across the border? \nTwo things. I am so proud of the fact that I got dialogue started on illegal immigration. \nAnd people in the media \u2013 in all fairness \u2013 they were very rough on me that first week, and then many of them have now apologized to me and almost everybody\u2019s apologized. \nBecause it turned out I was right. \nBeautiful Kate [Steinle] in San Francisco was shot by an illegal who was here five times and they couldn\u2019t do anything about it. And believe me, Mexico kept pushing him back because they didn\u2019t want him. Believe me, that\u2019s true. \nNow, everybody is saying that Trump was right. \nBut I tell you, I took a lot of abuse. I had disloyal people like Macy\u2019s and like others \u2013 \u201cOh, Donald, you\u2019re a little controversial. We\u2019re going to have to drop you.\u201d \nI said, I don\u2019t care \u2013 the ties \u2013 what do they mean to me? He\u2019s wearing one of my ties, by the way, it\u2019s very nice. [Laughter]\n \nI never liked them that much because they were made in China so it never mattered that much.

They do bear some responsibility but I think he\u2019d probably didn\u2019t do it not for that reason. \nSomehow he just doesn\u2019t have courage. There\u2019s something missing from our president. \nHad he crossed the line and really gone in with force and had done something to Assad \u2013 if he had gone in there with tremendous force, you wouldn\u2019t have millions of people displaced all over the world. \n...I think they [the Senators who voted against authorizing Obama to use force against Assad] had a responsibility. Absolutely. I think we have three of them here. I think they had a responsibility. "}]
